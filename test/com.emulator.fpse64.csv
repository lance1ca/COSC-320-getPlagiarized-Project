However, the developer has been extremely responsive and helpful in trying to get all these issues resolved. I'm very appreciative of this, especially since I've had no luck with the ePSXe devs when I had issues with that emulator (external controllers would keep causing the app to crash when they connected/disconnected). I've been using the original FPse emulator for years, and this version does seem like an improvement, it does fix some issues (mostly audio related) I have with some games in the original. I look forward to seeing it improve over time. I would personally highly recommend it, but maybe check out the original till this version gets over some of its teething issues.",4,3,1.7.4,2021-01-08 09:22:37,,
