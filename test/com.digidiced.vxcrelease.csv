There were times where I didn't know if I was looking at my board or the AI's. The UI gets in the way of making decisions. There are redundant animations (if you harvest a field with a red and white wine, it shows an animation for each with a fade out/in for each). It's disappointing as it's such a great game. But, also playing the Charterstone game on Steam, I'm finding similar UI issues--for instance the backspace key takes you back a screen instead of, you know, deleting a character. It appears that Stonemaier Games puts in a lot of effort to make sure the details of the board games really shine, but the same level of care is not matched in the apps.
