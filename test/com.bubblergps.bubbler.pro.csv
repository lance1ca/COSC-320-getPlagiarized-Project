Latitude has been frustrating however due to the way it updates your location as it's not always consistent.  Showing where I was two hours ago isn't very helpful.  Bubbler fixes this by dropping breadcrumbs on the spotwalla map at regular intervals.  Granted, it's only live if you have a data connection but that is one of the very nice features of Bubbler is that it'll queue up points while you have no data and then drop them on the map later.  I just finished a two day 1500 mile trip that included a lot of time spent in rural NM where there was no cell coverage.
