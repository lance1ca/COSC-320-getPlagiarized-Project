If you want to do a live show with your best backing tracks, look no further. It's a steal at this price",5,0,1.20,2021-02-07 02:14:38,,

Text editing takes a little getting used to along with setting up markers but is straightforward once you understand the process. The feature to set and remember individual track volume is great, but feedback on the slider would be a useful addition. As woul changing key. Very good.",4,3,1.20,2020-12-25 02:58:01,,

After a long stretch with no updates, and crashes becoming a common occurance, I decided to see what was new. After an afternoon of searches, and review reading, I decided to give StageBaxx a try. Now, after a couple of months of use, I can honestly say I am VERY happy with StageBaxx. The interface is very easy to use. The screen layout (8"" tablet) is easy to read on stage. As a singing drummer - BG/harmony - the notes/lyric option is awesome! So nice to have a reference in case of brain-farts. Yes, it does take some time to set the timestamps. However it is a straight forward process. Highly recommend StageBaxx to any musician looking for a backing track/sequence player. Especially with a notes option for chords, cues, or lyrics.",5,4,1.20,2020-10-25 14:24:10,,

I am really sorry you thought that. The purpose of this app is to give a specialized player to the real profesional gigging musicians which satisfy the special needs while performing live, which are: autopause, show custom lyrics, custom playlist, adjust volume for each track separately and so on.",2020-10-06 15:31:52

This app takes a bit of time to set up the lyrics if you want them to show at different times through the song (so in effect like scrolling lyrics) or to add hints for instrumentals/solos etc but once it is done it is a great app. Martin the developer was very friendly and quick to respond to my initial set up teething problems. He was willing to fix any problems.,5,13,1.20,2020-04-28 16:43:29,,
