choice on Falcom and DotEmu's part. I am surprised at how nice the game

appreciate the achievements that they implemented. This version is superior 
to all of the others I played because of the fun controls. While Adol kinda 
moves too quickly in towns, his speed comes in handy in battle, and bashing 
your skull into bad guys like a mad man never gets old. Grinding in this 
game is actually fun due to the controls and how Adol simply runs face 
first into enemies as they burst into a pile of blood and body parts in his 
wake. This game is a bit short though, but that's why there is additional 
difficulty settings and a time attack mode. And if you cannot get enough of 
Adol's adventures, part two is available on Google play as well. Buying one 
game and not the other is not recommended. If you enjoy this game, you 
might as well go ahead and get both. They go together like bread and butter.",5,0,1.0.6,2018-04-20 13:25:07,,

(3) It is awesome to have BGM mode selector (chronicle/original = eternal?/PC88). They know old FALCOM gamers are picky and have own strong tastes on the choices.  Bad: (1) It should not ""premise"" language from the device's language settings. It should be customizible. I want to play the game in Japanese mode (because it makes the best sense to play it in the original language) but hate to use Japanese in my general device settings. Also I'm sure that those non-Japanese gamers who love to play Japanese game very often prefer to read messages in Japanese (for the same reason I explained above). They learn Japanese for that!
