The Android port seems to have a bunch of bugs, though. Screen taps were not registering properly on a new Galaxy S20+. Game would crash when coming back after multitasking. Game itself is a lot like Myst. Unclear where to go and what to do, and hints are often insufficient. Probably best to play with a guide to avoid frustration. I had tried the iPad version previously and it was not buggy like this one. Recommend ios for that reason.

All this would be fine and earn it 4 stars, lacking one because of lack of puzzling and gameplay action (despite cool connection to real, realtime events), but I'm giving three because the controls are what gave the game challenge - and not on purpose. The controls as they seem to be intended would be fine but, at least on my device (Samsung Pro 8.4), were borderline unbearable. The tap requirements (slow double tap)  were stupid strict, an almost constant issue, both in required speed and the precision required for taps to register; small signs, symbols, pathways, etc often left me ""tip-tapping"" for 10 seconds trying to hit it just right to reg...and my fingers are small!

I also love the style in which the game is rendered, so the backgrounds, to me, are absolutely wonderful.  That said... the touch interface implementation is consistently lacking. The only reason I only docked this game one star is because I know this is NOT an easy problem to tackle, and I respect what the developer has done. But it does, to me, take away from the playability of an otherwise excellent game.  I do occasionally find the modern text jarring in the context of the game, but overall I know that's a personal thing and not really a failure on the part of the game, so it's more a matter of your particular expectations. I do think this is absolutely worth the price, if not necessarily for everyone, then at very least for fans of old school point and click adventures (the kind we loved for their witty, snarky dia/monologue and clever, user-driven gameplay).",4,38,1.0.19.1,2015-01-27 08:13:37,,

Like a mix between 'Another World' and 'Zelda'. Very artistic and beautiful art and music.  The bad: Confusing plot with a VERY confusing ending. Feels like watching 'Lost' on TV again. Too many unanswered questions at the end of a very confusing game which makes you ask yourself - was it worth it ?  Conclusion: This game will make you loath rainbows.  Was it worth it? - Although I felt like I'm walking too much in the game - back and forth over and over again and although the confusing plot and ending - the answer is simply YES. If value more the journey rather than the destination, this is an enjoyable game which I guess is all about the journey.  I keep finding myself wanting more of that wonderful, bizarre world.
