If the game takes off for the developer, players may get an expansion in the future, and if not, it doesn't matter because the game is charming in its current format. Good luck to the developer, I really enjoyed playing the game. Thank you.",5,8,1.0.1,2019-03-05 12:27:15,,

Enjoying it so far, but some kind of indicator as to whether prices are high or low on a planet would be useful. At first, its kind of trial & error whether you're overpaying or getting a bargain.

There are times I wish there was asteroid mining or space stations or other pilots, but the lack of combat is unique and contributes a lot to this game's zen-like feel. It makes space travel feel less like a career and more like a casual hobby, which really makes it stand out!",5,9,1.0.1,2019-02-28 12:01:25,,

I purchased the best ship and explored everywhere in only a few hours. If more content is going to be released I would give this game 5 stars, but for the content that is available, it does not seem to be worth the purchase price.",3,6,1.0,2019-01-28 10:37:41,,
