It needs to be able to set it to only download 2 sites at a time.  3 or more causes my phone to restart. So it doesn't complete the scheduled download anyway. Too bad that is very inconsistent.  Sometimes it indicates that it downloaded a website but it is the same (not updated news) information from 3 days ago.  Often it fails to download and just doesn't update with no indication why or what to do to make it work next time.  Pictures often do not show up.
