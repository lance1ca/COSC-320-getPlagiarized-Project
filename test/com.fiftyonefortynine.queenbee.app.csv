Tonight I took off stars because I am tired of another night with u at the center.. Yet a super challenge.. Love it. The NY TIMES one is too easy. The others on Google play also are too easy and boring.. However, It doesn't recognize all legitimate words. Way too many times with u as the center letter.. No fun. Much harder than the New York times spelling bee! And I am humbled üòÅ Oh some Spanish words are recognized.",3,3,1.0.49,2021-02-03 18:21:39,,

I somewhat regret this. This app has a pretty lousy dictionary, real words are not counted but some prefixes are! Sometimes proper names are counted too. Obscure words are counted, ones that are archaic spellings of current words.

The game is so larded up with obscure little words that you have little hope of advancing very far. After you find all the more common words, you end up punching in random possibilities in hopes of getting a score. It's just not fun, which is kinda the point of a game, no? I'll stick with the New York Times version.",2,6,1.0.13,2020-06-06 04:48:17,"Love the phrase 'larded up'. 

If you play in a game room, you can use an easier dictionary, if that's to your liking. The daily gram is generated from the 'most words' dictionary. And some days are more difficult than others. I think of it like Scrabble - you start to learn more words and they get less obscure over time.",2020-06-06 04:53:10

Edit: Thanks devs for quick response. Actually cannot put my phone into dark mode as I have a theme installed; it's not worth completely changing the rest of my setup in order to try it. Played the game a bit more today; find the daily dictionary to be too limited. Words like ""dollop"" and ""clod"" should not be considered uncommon enough to be excluded imo; word games should be about playing with your vocab! List has to be arbitrary but feelsbadman",4,1,1.0.8,2020-05-05 20:43:16,"Starting tomorrow, the daily game will use a more expansive dictionary - hopefully your vocab will be stretched!
