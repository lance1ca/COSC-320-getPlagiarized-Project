Can't believe this is available for just 10 Indian Rupee that is like few US cents. Combat is a bit repetitive but unlocking new abilities makes it fun. The story is nice. Characters are fun. My only qualm against the game is that in some missions they just throw so many enemies at you at once that you have to use Justice power. No strategy can win you those matches. To have Justice power you gotta grind a lot. That's it. Epic game. Would love a DLC if available.,5,10,1.6.26,2020-09-12 11:27:06,,

Enemies seemingly random movement distances; one enemy that might have only been able to move 3-4 tiles in one mission is now capable of moving 10+ tiles the next mission. And the game puts barriers on progression if you are unable to beat either a main mission or a sidequest. So if you can't get past a mission, there's no means of grinding experience or currency for better skills; you simply have to get lucky with good tile sets.   If the difficulty curve revolves entirely around luck, its simply not fun. What a waste of a unique gameplay concept.",1,19,,2019-05-12 18:22:20,"Hi! In the early levels, try to play defensively.

It's certainly not a strategy RPG (at least not in the normal sense), But neither can it be called an Action RPG.   I don't like strategy RPGs on account that I find their difficulty to be rather steep. THIS game, on the other hand seems a lot more aproachable for me then.  Still, the difficulty curve isn,t quite as smooth as I would like it to be. (Of course, it may also just be that I suck at these kinds of games in general)   Tokens to unlock new abilities are more difficut than I would like. Justice tokens take a long time to collect and their effectiveness makes me question the effort. The same could be said about Nitrium shards.  On the other hand, its nice to across a game in the Play Store that has an actual story with meat! The sound and music aren't bad either.

This sounds like either the app wasn't given permissions to read its external data file during installation, or something else went wrong during the installation. Please confirm that the app has Storage permissions enabled. If that doesn't fix it, please delete the game & try reinstalling from Google Play.",2017-12-17 22:56:52
