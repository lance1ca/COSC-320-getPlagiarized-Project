The steering, whether by tilting or using the slider, is very sluggish.  The capsize mechanism, however, is way too sensitive.  Those combine to dump you in the water way too frequently.  Another annoyance is that the start of every race faces you away from the start line, and you can't turn towards it until you trim you still which many times causes you to capsize because your can't steer!  Annoying as hell!  I would love to play this game more, but I can't stand to touch it until that's fixed.  I'll give it 4 stars and check back now and then to see if it's fixed.
