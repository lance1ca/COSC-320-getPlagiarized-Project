However, there are major problems that need to be fixed.  After four days I still haven't achieved a full sync.  To be fair my dropbox contains over 21 gb and 57000 files but for business users I would think it is not so abnormal.  It also highlights a problem with the way the app goes about syncing.  It appears that instead of only making changes to files that have been changed the app rescans every file every time it starts a sync.  Thus, when it doesn't finish the whole sync (for instance when having to go to work interrupts the progress the app has made overnight) or when going home interrupts the progress made while I'm at work) it appears to start over with the scanning on the new attempt. I've also noticed the sync go idle even though it has a connection, battery charge is within set parameters and the sync is not complete. Edit:  After over a week I still haven't gotten a full sync. Looks like it is the idling that's the main issue as it restarts the sync after every idle.  I'll be looking for another service.",2,1,2.0,2012-07-31 13:58:18,,

Use SDrescan app to fix if necessary.
