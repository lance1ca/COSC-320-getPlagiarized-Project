No apparent way to purchase anything with real money to help your character.  Cartoonish looking rather than real. I got disgusted. LDW hasnt done much to keep the version i have of this game interesting. Its the same every generation and they do lots of annoying (to me) things in it, SO I thought this game might be an improvement since I had to pay for it.  I want my money back and dont want you to waste yours!  Get the other, better free version.",1,6,1.1,2017-01-24 16:13:27,,

The game does get boring once you buy all the add ons but the game play is still neat since they will sustain themselves while you are away. As long as they have food and you've visited them/praised them it will be fine. Now to make money, adopt a person that makes a really low income to start (those are the ones that make the most in the end). Make them work and praise them repetitively. They will try and run away by the third praise but just drag them back and keep doing it for about 10 times. exit the game and make sure it has stopped running in the background. Go to the settings in your phone and change the time to 5 hours ahead or one day ahead. Check your game and they will have made much more money. Change the time back on your phone. You can do this three or 4 times every day but keep in mind that although you make quick money, your people will age faster! No biggie if you want to see more generations. Good game!

About the toolbar you DON'T need to drag the items you just tap the item once then tap the person/object you want to use it on e.g. to place groceries you tap them once then tap the kitchen table.
