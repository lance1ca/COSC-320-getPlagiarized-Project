Another $8 gets you all the Gods. I own the board game and was excited for the app version. I have to say it's a great port and control is very fluid. I feel like the app on its own is worth the $5, but asking ($2) for each God pack expansions loses a star. It doesn't add a ton of replay, just some variety. Making each expansion $1 seems a bit more fair. After all, there's gotta be a Golden Fleece expansion eventually. How much in app purchases will there be?",4,18,1.76,2019-07-14 13:03:57,,
