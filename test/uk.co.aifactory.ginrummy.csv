Opponent to often draws a card goes and out. Not realistic card sequence.  There must be a better program. And to think I paid for this is a travesty.,1,4,1.02,2012-09-06 18:54:50,,

The game runs smoothly, doesn't wear down my battery and after countless games and hours at a time if it does slow down, it only slows down for maybe one or two seconds.
