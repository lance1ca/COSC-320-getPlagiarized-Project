The only thing I miss about having it on the DS is that you could put the console to sleep and pick up the game later as if you never left. Here you need to jump through the title screen and a recap but that's not a deal breaker. The story too, had me gripped until the end, I even shed a tear. No spoilers here though, pick it up and play it yourself.",5,1,1.0.1,2021-01-28 21:47:56,,

When they first started re-releasing these games I was a little disappointed that they didn't decide to do more with them. The same applies here as there were a lot of cool things they could've implimented had they decided to do things like re-record the music, or add new cutscenes. I get that these were probably supposed to be simple ports, but still. If you can get past that though, this game is just as great as it was 10 years ago.",4,5,,2020-11-18 12:14:23,,
