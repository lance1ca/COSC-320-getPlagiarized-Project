This is the 3rd app I have tried for keeping an inventory of my threads, and  can definitely say this is the best one by far.   Figuring out how to save  my entries was not really self-explanatory, but I did figure it out.  Also, when entering your whole inventory, you don't want to select and save them one at a time, so I would select a bunch and then hit the plus sign, which would then give me the save icon. Sometimes while doing this, I would select a bunch and then I guess my finger didn't hit right on the little circle to select  the thread and the app would bypass the plus sign and go right to the save icon. When this happened,  it would only save the last thread I selected; not all of them.  This was a little frustrating, and that's the only reason I didn't give this app 5 stars. Now that all of my threads are entered, this won't be a problem since I won't be entering so many at the same time.",4,0,1.8,2016-02-08 12:34:36,Thanks for the feedback Debbie!
