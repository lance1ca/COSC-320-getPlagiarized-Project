You can configure stations: radio player, button lower right corner.

Had the free one for ages and thought I'd get the premium to show some support. Waking up to the radio is vastly superior to conventional beep alarms for me and this has a massive array of available radio streams. Top stuff,5,0,1.8.2,2018-08-24 00:33:01,"Thanks again! Hope you like the new one!
