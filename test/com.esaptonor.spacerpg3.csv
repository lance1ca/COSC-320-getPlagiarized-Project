Just messing around until my latest play through. After hitting end game and getting the ascended serph. The game seems way to easy I hope to see some new expansion come out one day with a new story ark that has some unknown faction try and invade your corner of the galaxy after you conquered all off the systems. The end goal for this would lead you to a new galaxy that you must take over Aswell with many epic battles through out all the systems of the new enemy.

The campaign is interesting so far, and the ship customisation has some interesting choices, such as the ability to downgrade your ships hull to ""duct tape"".

Makes me not want to let my sci-fi nerd daughter play it. That said... Interesting to play, great concept, however, there needs to be a way to select who is an enemy and who is an ally (perhaps by faction) because one shot aimed at, for example, a pirate, that accidentally hits an AER vessel, instantly turns all AER vessels into enemies who shoot at you. I also wish I had a button for ""largest"" enemy to target. All too often the closest enemy is a tiny BS drone from a huge mothership and it's what's shooting at and damaging me more so than its drones.

be needlessly frustrating. Perhaps eliminating the speed factor in landing 
would help. The firing arcs are a little weird but I suppose add realism. I 
will end this on a positive note by simply saying that I'm very impressed

practically useless. The main storyline could also be a bit more eventfull

void but there are a few things I find could be improved on 1. The 
targeting system we should be able to tap a enemy on screen to target them 
not drag I found this especially vexing when fighting the pirate benomoths 
who would unleash a endless wave of fighters and Making it impossible to 
lock onto. 2. Your faction ships while powerful are all based on combat 
while this is fine to those who love constant combat (me included) a 
trading ship would be a welcome edition it would also be awesome if we 
could in counter our own ships naturally in other systems not just our own. 
3. Your own fractions reinforcement fleet always arrives to late to help 
its good that they come at all but when the come when your shields are 
already down and your halls hanging on by a thread they don't help much 
most of the time I single handedly take the planet myself it would be nice 
if you could add a call reinforcements in the fraction control tab this 
would allow us to not only call them in when starting a Conquest but also 
if we run into a bad situation and know we need them straight away. 4. 
While i understand it would be hard to take over a node with no planet it 
would be awesome if we would purchase a smaller space station from New 
kandon to take over them. 5. Not sure if this was intentional but after 
buying and using the Terra forming engine from boran Using it on new faleon 
and taking the colonists to it they get all set up but I receive no payment 
from them also I found we can not Terra form the rebel home world after the 
ARE outright bombed it leaving it a useless world and after returning to 
boran I found that they no longer sell the Terra forming engine meaning we 
can only Terra form one of the 3 broken planets",5,0,1.2.0.2,2018-07-16 00:17:54,,

This is much more intuitive since you can see where you are pressing, see how the ship is responding and the feedback gives you much much greater control.   Games like starlost and others have this control system and there is a big difference. The game itself is great and has a lot of depth.  The oddball firing arcs of weapons is kind of irritating, but a better control system (and maybe an autofire toggle for non-torpedos) would likely alleviate a lot of this.

The UI is clunky and there is next to no customization of the UI available. Music is only available in the main menu, once in game you are left with awkward silence. Not even your thrusters make noise, the only noise in this game is from weapons, and that is just random beeping. Although you are told you don't have to do the main storyline and you can choose what you want to do in this game, this is a lie. After doing a few random missions (deliver x to system y) you are railroaded into the main mission without a choice. Your cargo bay is filled and you have no choice but to complete the mission, followed by another main mission you are forced to complete. The final straw was when I tried to reload my game and accidentally pressed ""New Game"" instead of ""Continue"" as the buttons are fairly small and touch each other. A small text box appeared and informed me that starting a new game would erase my current save, but the ONLY option for you to press at this point is ""okay"", which promptly started a new game and wiped my save. This was my mistake, but I was dumbfounded that there was no cancel button on that pop up to allow me to back out.

I have some suggestions for the developer : 1.  A counter of how many enemy ships are present in system (this could come with a module like the analytic sensors or something) because i find it hard to conquer a system when i defeat that battleship and start flying toward the planet when all of a sudden 2 more spawn and blow me up worse than death 2.  The shields for large ships are annoying,  even if i manage to dodge the bullets the shield radius is far enough go fetch that stray bullet and do damage to the shields 3. An ability to decided which kind of corvette you would like to have in your hanger bays or be able to customise them so they have better engines or weapons and so forth 4. The hints on the start screen are a bit dismal,  it should be a bit more informative about certain modules(the pop-up tutorials are easily forgotten if not read thoroughly)  But don't let my ranting annoy you,  just listing a few things i think would come in handy",5,0,1.1.8.1,2018-02-22 03:24:50,,

Don't buy this expecting a totally finished game, it needs improvements that I'm sure the dev is working on.   As stands there is no minimap that I'm aware of so navigating to the destination for missions is difficult, this also may be that I don't know where to look. Also, it's a little funky navigating the ship, but if you remember how to fly like in Asteroids, you'll have no issue figuring it out as it's similar.

Allied aggression: the other Allied ships can basically shoot each other and you all day without any penalty whatsoever whilst if you make one mistake like a stray bullet or missile then you basically get hunted down by your own team! I recommend making it to wear if you shooting your ally multiple times and then he and only he will shoot back a few times and return as a warning shot rather than hunt you down, and if you continue then you get hunted down by everyone. 2. Manual Navigation: even after I had unlocked the portal ring I never used it because it was so difficult to maneuver my ship close enough and slow enough to get it to work! I recommend you use your auto navigation and set up a menu where it says things like  [Navigate to FTL zone] [Navigate to Warp Ring] [Navigate to nearest landing pad] Things like that so you don't have to play Ring Around the Rosie with a moon. 3. Ally missles: I don't think I can even count the number of times of day to Allied missiles... as a solution I recommend that allies cannot damage you in anyway unless you damage them multiple times (see #1) 4. Protect missions: now I don't know if I'm just being stupid or not with this one but I can't seem to figure out how to do protect missions. I go to said area, I shoot the Baddies, and then 5 minutes later it tells me I failed.... I recommend like a wave counter (aka: how many waves of ships you have to defeat left) or a kill counter ( same thing as last one except with kills instead of waves)  Overall this Is a really great game and I'd be more than willing to give it a higher score if one or two of these issues were fixed (cough cough allies cough cough)",3,1,1.1.7,2017-12-14 21:26:39,,

Edit 4 star: Ive been playing abit and have enjoyed it i would reccomend anybody that likes rpg/strategie esc games but i would get this fast if i were you since it seems with every new release the old game is removed also i suggest not unistalling the older games since doing so will cause you to lose the money you spent on those games.

The controls are a bit of a pain (the joystick stops following your finger if you move your finger too far, the targeting button doesn't always work/cycles through every target except the one you want) and the UI is very clunky. I haven't quite finished the main storyline yet, as I've been grinding to get a larger ship, but what I have played has been engaging. There is quite a bit of grinding involved, which some people may not like. There are many planets, but also many empty solar systems, which seems weird. Also there is usually only 1 planet per system, where's Mars, Venus? I like the conquering system for the planets, but there should also be a way to conquer the empty systems, maybe put a very small space station in them so there are safe roads between your conquered inhabited systems in places like Union territory or the top right side of the map.

(Our station can be raided, and we can fix it if we lose / auto repair) -Fleet system, having functional NPC Trader would be cool -Corporation, making our own corp and produce custom ship and selling them would be cool  -negotiation system, now we dont have to rely everytime on escape / fight  (Just for the lels) plz Nerf: -death (u know what i am talking about), it 1shot me",5,1,,2017-05-22 03:09:59,"Thanks for the feedback! Death can be defeated but you need something special, maybe the aliens can offer you something?",2017-05-22 16:34:11
