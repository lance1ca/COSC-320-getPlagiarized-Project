In ""gig"" mode, the fact that you can accidentally edit your set list (including the BPMs!) is completely inexcusable when there is a ""rehearsal"" mode as well. Playing live? Write out a set list with the track BPMs on it as a back up, because this app will one day f* you up on stage.

Tempo has all of the above, plus two secret weapons:  1) You can mute the click and use the flashing lights (one for each beat of the bar). So I can use it at a gig, in Church, anywhere.  2) You can store tempos and time signatures for each song in a setlist, so you don't have to reprogram it for each song.

Copying any song from one list to another was not possible past #10 and there were random deletions of my Master song list (80+ songs). However, updates have changed my opinion since the beginning of my experience with this app from 1 star to 4 stars because they have remedied the copy issue making it a fantastic app to copy from a master list into various set lists. I am not sure on the deletion of song lists - just back up or ""share"" them to an email and you can restore within seconds. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because, although there have been strides to fix the issues, there are a few features I would like to see added such as a sort feature (A-Z). This would be extremely helpful with a ""master"" list. Other than that, I have made almost a 180 in my attitude and my endorsement for this app. I highly reccommend it now.

This version looks like crap on the Nexus 7 and is missing a lot if features available on the iOS version. You can't reorder set lists. You can tell it to just play for X number of measures like you can on the iOS version. Overall sure there is something better out there for a Android Metronome.,2,0,,2012-12-11 17:51:45,,

The main thing for me is that you can't smoothly adjust the tempo on the fly. Say you are playing a gig and the band say that you are playing too slow, you press the + button but then the click starts again out of time meaning you'd either have a completely out of time click or have to turn it off. The iPhone version doesn't do this, it just increases the speed of the current click meaning no-one notices the subtle increase. This is probably still the best app on android but please Frozen ape make it better or ideally as good as the iPhone version - that would be awesome!",3,2,1.0,2012-06-30 04:06:05,,
