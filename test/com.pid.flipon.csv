The game play is the same, but with some key (and intentional) differences, such as being able to move blocks through the air without them falling right away. The active chain detection is also not the greatest, which causes the game to become more about setting up for chains compared to doing action/skill chains. The dev is actively updating the game and is also active in the Flipon Discord! Update: Leaderboard fixed, pls beat my score!",5,5,1.4.2,2021-02-02 08:47:10,,

There are lots of variants in the Play store; however, most of them are filled up with greedy IAPs. This game is easily the best game in this category. It was worth the price. I have been playing it the whole day, and I see myself finishing it soon and replay it many times. I haven't found any bugs so far. The difficulty is on point. In one word ENJOYABLE.",5,3,1.4.1,2021-01-29 07:14:55,,
