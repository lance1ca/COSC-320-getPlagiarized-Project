This feature is entirely missing in the android version. 3) Both versions add a sequential number at the beginning of exported tracks. I have to manually delete it every time. ... As much as I like the iOS version, I'm now looking for a replacement on android.",3,6,2.8.5,2020-11-08 06:29:09,,

Permette inoltre importazione, esportazione e condivisione di tracce, feature non indifferente per chi la usa per trekking o come navigatore MTB/Enduro. Davvero ben fatta. Per ultimo ma non per importanza l'assistenza Ã¨ molto professionale, parte del merito va anche al supporto",5,3,2.6.2,2019-05-31 05:07:48,,
