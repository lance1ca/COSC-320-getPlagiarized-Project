Thx for bringing back my old fond memories. Romancing Saga 3 was my first ever game for JRPGs. Even though it was in japanese and pirate back then and I merely played this game without the true understanding to its plots, I still enjoyed it so much. Now Im so happy I can purchase it legally as a token of appreciation to developers. This game is full vibrant yet detailed storylines with awesome heroes, not to mention about the exceptional musics and mysteries. LOVE IT!",4,117,1.0,2019-12-06 02:49:08,,
