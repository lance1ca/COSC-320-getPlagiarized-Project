Lots of fun. Perfect mobile game if you are into deck building type games. I never write reviews, and came here to write this one because this is the most fun playing a mobile game I have had since the OG no pay to play Plants Vs. Zombies in like, 2006. Playing on a Google Pixel. Plusses: -Not a lot of cognitive overload, you don't need to learn a bunch of mechanics to get the game. -Depth. Though the essential gameplay is simple, the variation of decks, stacks, abilities, etc. adds some challenge. -No AIP / Play to Win: All characters are un-lockable with currency gained from playing, and the time it takes to unlock is not long at all. 3 or 4 wins, or about 6 games to get a new character. About one game to get a new card. -Replay-ability: If you buy the ""secondary"" characters, and pump up the difficulty, it stays fun for a long time. -Turn based: No need for constant attention. Minuses: -Agreed with some here, runs can feel to short. Right when you get the deck just about how you want it, the game can end. -No variance in the final boss. I understand why, but it might be cool to get some different ones. -Can be hard to know that you can buy additional cards / characters. Had a friend who didn't know he could trash some basic attack cards buy buying the character cards. I love this game. Great job Devs! I agree with some others here where an ""unlimited mode"" would be fun, as well as a ""build your own deck"" possible with a points system so you couldn't just build a monster every time.

I initially downloaded this looking for something to play underground on the way to work. It had to be simple, engaging, and network-free. My initial impressions were, ""Meh. Worth the money, but not much more than that,"" and I moved on to other games that would entertain my squirrel-like attention span. Sure enough, upon returning, the quality of only a few simple patches was clear. There were a lot of small details that made things feel smoother and more satisfying. Greybeard, for instance, was frustrating. The addition of a new resource (spell charges) didn't have enough ways to manage intelligently, and the playstyles were limiting for him. Additionally, he had little to no health management without enough damage output to give the glass cannon feel you'd expect in return. They've addressed this, and a lot of other inderwhelming, yet class defining abilities to feel satisfying and fun. More than anything, this is a small game I didn't expect much from. It's not big or detailed, and I figured the post release effort would be equivelant. That's not the case, and the more of you who buy this game the more likelyhood I'll receive new characters to play.",5,2,1.0,2018-11-20 07:37:39,,

The game becomes more and more fun over time as you figure out better combos and overcome things that previously seemed impossible (with a little/lot of luck in some cases). And absolutely zero purchasables or pay-to-win elements. A bit of a rant on difficulty: My only complaint with this game is I've run into a wall with a few of the classes on the higher ""demon difficulties"" (various hard mode monster buffs). I think some classes rely on what feels like less than a five percent chance of overall lucky RNG to survive up to the boss. A big part of this reason is several enemy types can randomly chain cast their entire decks and completely one-shot *any possible build* of your character at any stage of the game. Of course part of the fun of the game, and deck builders and roguelikes in general, is to learn to play in such a way to mitigate these odds, but in this game it can feel really bad when it happens. And I don't feel particularly skillful when i have to reroll something a dozen times just to finally roll the couple items required to survive. I think these difficulties can use another few balance passes to prevent the one-shottiness feel, particularly for classes that don't really have a way to stack armor or similar defenses early on.

greatness by an annoyingly tiny distance. The fundamental combat mechanics 
are well designed and fun, but deeper systems fall flat. You can choose 
what regions to journey through, but it is pretty arbitrary. There is also 
an unlock system, but it is very very short lived, especially if you 
identify some of the unlockable cards as actually bad. It would be nice if 
there were more unlocks and challenges; unlockable monsters, bosses, events 
would increase the longevity. It also really needs some game options: 
difficulty settings, extra long game, etc. Visually, the monster art is 
excellent (but inexplicably flipped). However it is so strongly 
'influenced' by Adventure Time it makes me wonder if this wasn't originally 
intended as an A.T. game? You can see in the screen shot above: Bruno = 
Finn, Mischief = Marcelline, Rose = Bubblegum. There is also a boss that is 
almost identical to the Ice King. I could go on... Anyway, it mainly looks 
great but the game board is just as you see in the shots above and it never 
changes. With a little more ambition the game could have looked much cooler 
- eg: the board could change depending on region. Illustrations for the 
events would have added a lot as well. Overall it is a nice game, it just

The game is well crafted and has a unique aesthetic. I really enjoyed it 
and have played through several games, even after I defeated the bosses 
with each character. I'd say it's one of my favorite android titles and 
genuinely had a blast playing it. Some downsides, you can often feel like 
you've lost agency because the methods to alter your deck are completely 
random. It can feel bad to lose on luck. The game constantly tells you to 
carefully consider what you add to your deck because the more cards you 
have your deck will lose potency. This is true but it gives you ways to 
thin your deck by selling your cards, and or dumping a single card at a 
temple. The random generator that serves these to you dictate if you can 
win on a run; if you aren't given the opportunity to improve your decks 
stats and consistency, you just lose. In the event of dumping cards: you 
can't choose with cards to sell, and that causes the game to periodically 
pick a key card in your strategy. While you don't have to dump a card at 
this prompt but it would be nice to have a little more agency. You want to 
get rid of cards you find useless, so this prompt can easily make you feel 
like you've been screwed over. Often times certain cards become completely 
dead selections. The mage, for example, has a spell called shatter which is 
spike damage for the frost path. If the game doesn't serve you frost cards 
later, it's an ineffectual card for the rest of the game. If that 
randomness and lack of agency sounds annoying them skip the game.",5,0,1.0,2018-04-17 11:25:16,,

A fun deckbuilder stripped down to the essentials that can be played onehanded with simple swipes. Four extremely different characters to master make a lot of replayability for a very low price. The game also has almost zero grinding - just learning to play better and better. This gives a great feeling of achievement and progress. No microtransactions and no compromise in the gameplay department - thats why I like premium games! Overall, buy this and play if youre into deckbuilder games.",5,7,1.0,2018-03-30 16:07:38,,

I'd encourage you to keep at it.  If you're low on health before a battle, you can swipe the monster left to skip it, which recovers some health.  As with all card games, you'll occasionally run into some bad luck / unfair scenarios.  I think if you give it a couple tries, you'll make some progress.",2018-02-07 17:42:36

Some cards act on what you've played during a turn, but since you don't have a hand and top deck everything, their value is dubious.  The game tells you ""don't take everycard!"" But you are forced to take a card during some level ups.  Enemy difficulty ramps up obscenely difficult, and the devs decide to arbitrarily throw high damage spells into their decks just for spite/spike damage...frequent use of Zap is a good example. (Does 6 damage at no Stamina cost which is absurd) Enemies frequently have cool cards that you will never see.  There's only 12 additional cards to unlock in total and the classes don't seem all that different from each other.  The game will let you double stack 50% Dodge cards but doesnt tell you that you don't have 100% Dodge but 50.  Damage reduction cards say they reduce all incoming damage by 1, but do no say damage can't be reduced to 0.  You could get a healthy dose of Temple/card removal, or none.  You could be spiked for half your HP if you didn't manage to one shot an enemy with no meaningful choice or play that would have stopped it.
