Yes, you need to wait for approval to use IP based position updates - yes, it may even take a while.  Big deal, get over it.

Easy to setup if you have done any APRS before. Otherwise, look at Bob Bruniga's website and learn the basics first.  One reviewer complained that this app will flood APRS with beacons since it does not listen. This not true. With the Mobilnkd TNC, a received signal blocks transmission.With the Internet only beacon, the packets only appear on the APRS port of the web and does not transmit an RF signal so there is no packet flood on your local Igate, only a plot on aprs.fi. I think the internet can handle your beacons.  One other caution, APRS is not intended to be a real time vehicle tracker. There are other devices and apps to track your teenager or whatever. Using a very short interval for beaconing will flood the system with too many packets. Smart Beacon, which this software supports, is your and the entire packet communiy's friend. Use it.
