The pipes we have to put in for utilities and the stairs. wish those we could place over shopes and stuff. Few tips: leave at least 8 spaces on one side of the building for out door stuff that you will need later to upgrade things. The building is facing to the left so build your hall when you get it on the left of the building. Wait for it to save before closing it or you will lose your progress since last save.

The only difficulty I encounter with other games is trying to enjoy free games for free. This game isn't free and doesn't claim to be, but it is definitely well-worth it's small, one-time cost. I was shocked by how detailed and realistically complex the game play is. I started with the tutorials and then went on to the normal-level (difficulty) sandbox mode. I expected to easily progress, but that's not what happened lol. In fact, I had to start over 6 TIMES before I finally was able to stabilize my Highrise with a daily profit. Please understand, I'm not trying to discourage anyone. In fact, I suggest everyone get this game! Project Highrise is the only game (so far) that provides a real challenge for veteran mobile gamers. I was up until 3 am last night and the time flew by! I can't stress it enough... YOU NEED TO TRY THIS GAME!
