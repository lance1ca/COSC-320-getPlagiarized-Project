At first, I hesitated in buying because I expected Disillusion to be on the same level as the other Forgotten Hill games and was afraid that it is overpriced. How happy I am that I am wrong! The length, the story telling, the puzzles- everything is one step above all other FH games. If you've played the FH series, this game is definitely a must-play and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys point-and-click adventures and puzzles.
