It think i have headphones plugged in. we need to be able to choose the audio output for previewing recorded clips. EDIT: The response given is absolutely incorrect so I downgraded from 3 stars to 1 star. Android does allow for a program to override audio settings. I think permission is called MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS. In fact I use an app called Audio Router to force Field Recorder to output audio to Loudspeaker only. So is indeed possible. Furthermore the program stutters recording. There are many other recorders some are free which do not stutters. I don't understand the implementation but based on the response on how audio cannot be rerouted and is nothing they can do about it seems to me the creator is a can't do attitude unwilling to work with their users.,1,29,8.4,2018-12-14 12:42:58,Thank you for your feature request at the details: A future version of Field Recorder will allow to select speakers instead of headphones.

The tech support for the the Recorder have been very helpful though, currently we are still working on the problem I discuss below.  The app itself works very well.   ""From high-quality stereo recording...""  To quote above.  I am using this app on an HTC phone and it is supposed to be fully compatible.  When I switch it into ""stereo"" mode, I get stereo meters but they are both metering the same channel.  I know my phone is capable of recording stereo because movies are recorded with stereo tracks.  So what gives?  Very disappointed.   Other than that, it's a cool-looking app.  NOTE:  Somehow I have not received the emails from the maker of this product.  I think they may have been sent to my spam filter by mistake.  Apologies for posting this review without having the full information.  I will look at the suggestions and update my ratings accordingly..",5,1,4.5,2014-07-24 08:52:44,Thank you for your email.

We were looking for an app for a voice recorder that would record in wave and would provide feedback like audio level metering.  However, there are some user interface issues that preclude a wholehearted recommendation, at least for the 2.3 phone that was used for testing.  First, the indication of recording is way too small. The interface is dominated by the meters, and the two-touch record start can and often does fool the unwary - record button red, meters moving - looks like its running when it's not.  Second, playback after recording should be immediate, not requiring the user to rewind - this is not a cassette tape, after all.  Finally, the software doesn't obey the usual android conventions for using the menu button. It has its own, very tiny, settings button making it harder to use, at least on a phone.
