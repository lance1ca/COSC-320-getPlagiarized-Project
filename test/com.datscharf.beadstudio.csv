Worked the first couple of times but now nothing. Sort it out or its just a waste of money. I can find bead patterns on the Internet or pintrest, the whole point if this app was so I could make my own patterns from my own images.",2,5,9.3,2017-10-12 12:21:54,"Hi Jade, I know this is a long time ago, but I think I solved the problem. The problem was happening when using custom palette doing conversions. You needed to actively select it every time even though it was already selected. I have fixed it know so the conversion utility will read the custom palette every time :-)

The reason for the crashing was that Android has changed the permissions regarding accessing external storage. This should be fixed in version 7.2 (crossing my fingers).
