It does not work. After following the somewhat sketchy instructions, downloading the driver for the laptop, installing, etc., I found that the app frequently disconnects from the laptop. Further, using Windows 10, the tablet is not found as a second monitor. Windows 10 simply cannot detect the tablet as a second monitor. That's why I bought it and that's what it is advertised to do. After fighting with the app to get rid of the ""splash screen"" instructing how to use your fingers on a tablet, I somehow managed to get rid of that. Next, the tablet mirrored what I had on the laptop screen but only the initial screen. Whenever I opened anything else, it no longer mirrored the screen nor updated, nor could I do anything with the tablet screen. I have sent the log of the desktop (how can you get a DEVICE log when you can't get it to work on the device - they would like that log also) and all pertinent information as requested.

In my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 2019 I've managed to make the app work easy and flawlessly. Almost plug'n play. As it is, I can't give this app any less than a 5 Star Rating. BUT I need to highlight something very important: THIS APP DOES NOT WORK ON HUAWEI DEVICES! And this should be said by the devs themselves at the app page, instead of allowing people to buy the app, waste more than a hour of their time trying to make it work when it simply won't. But, with that said, this app is wonderful, IF you have a compatible device. No perceptible lag, full control of the desktop by the tablet and perfect for what I wanted. TL DR: It's perfect so long your device isn't a huawei. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Could not make it work on my huawei P30. After more than one hour trying my best to make it work, without success, I had to call it done and ask for a refund. Unfortunately, the refund policy of only 2 hours, forced me to give up before I had enough time to try everything. But it should be easier anyway. I simply cannot imagine all the trouble I had without success to be a normal thing. And if this app isn't compatible with huawei phones, it should be clearly displayed in the app information.",5,16,1.1.42,2020-06-28 12:22:52,"If you want to resolve the problem, Please contact us through our homepage with log files.

Using USB is great for when you don't want to use wifi or get the device warm from transmitting data constantly. I used to use DisplayLink powered, USB powered mini monitors, and now they're so hard to find - and the ones you CAN find are super expensive. This app makes those monitors obsolete, meaning one less device I need to carry with me should I need some extra desktop space. I usually use it for reference documents and videos, and sometimes chat windows like Slack. This app is great for breathing life into any old phones you may have!

I tried every possible way to make work using two different tablets and two different computers (both running Windows 10). My tablets are off brands. Much of my time was spent worrying that the adb drivers on the computers were not up to snuff.  Finally, I tried the competitor splash top wired xdisplay. That system connected with little trouble, but the irony is that, once that system connected, the connection with twomonusb also started working. Both now work equally smoothly  The only difference I could see between the two different systems was that splash top triggers having my laptop ask for me to trust the computer to which I'm connecting. I suspect that once that trust issue was solved through splash top it also solved the problem for twomon.  But, I'm a professor of analytic philosopher, so what do I really know?!

It didn't crash while I was using it for about 10 minutes. There has a very slight lag when I moved my mouse fast but it's still usable. Changing to high efficiency - high performance mode didn't seem to change anything. Not sure how well games would work but it would be fine for doing work (email, docs, etc).

It took me about 10 minutes of download, playing around with settings, etc. to get it right with my tablet, but it works great! I'm only using it for a second display for office type work....MS Office suite, email, etc. Pointers: Remember to turn on USB debugging on your tablet. The Display settings are accessed from the TwoMon app on your desktop, not through the normal right-click on the desktop menu. Figure out what your tablet display size is before going in so that it connects at the right resolution. In the TwoMon desktop app there is a setting: Display Setting>TwoMon Virtual display. On my first connection my tablet screen flashed white a couple times then returned to normal. It wasn't recognized. I turned this setting off and the system detected my tablet no problem. I'm $9.09 pleased with this app. At the time of this post there is a 2 hour trial period where you can easily get a refund through the Android store, but the devs seem responsive from what I've seen on the other comments if you have an issue. 11-17: Just upgraded to 5 stars.

Old Review: Not sure why this is rated so low. It does the job perfectly, especially if you use a USB cable. I recommend using a USB cable because it minimizes latency (although there is some still but I think this may vary depending on your device).  The one downside is their website is awful and its not even in English? If your browser auto-translates you can find your way around to downloading the Windows or Mac application and get everything working.  The installer and application itself is in English so no issues there. Update your website and you'll get 5/5 instead of 4/5.  The app makes your android device a second screen for your computer...for me it just shows up as another monitor that I can change resolution and position using Display Settings just like any other monitor.

Pros: Works great with my Acer A1-810, now using as a second monitor for spreadsheets and word docs. Great for on the go - just plug in the USB and hit connect and it's ready to go. It can do videos, but I wouldn't recommend it for primary use. Any office work or the like is very smooth. I don't often spend money for apps, and $9+ is expensive for any app, but it saved me $120 by not needing to buy a USB portable monitor, and my tablet is much more portable and versatile too.  Cons: Video can be glitchy. EXPENSIVE and no trial before buy. Even a 2 day trial would help! Worked for me though  **Compatibility test: If you're worried about it not working, download the PC/Desktop app BEFORE you buy the app (it's on their website) and make sure you REBOOT YOUR COMP - it's glitchy if you don't reboot after install. When you buy the app, you have 15 min after purchasing for a refund in case it for some reason isn't compatible or working for you, but if you don't have the desktop ready, the window will close.
