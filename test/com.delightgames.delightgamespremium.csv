The stories keep you sucked in and you're choices have the ability to take you in a complete opposite direction than the other choices. In a lot of these kind of games you make a choice and it will effect your stats, but you will still end up in generally the same place, not with the DG stories. I also like how you get a rating at the end of the episodes, it, gives you something to strive for. And for $20 you get a lot of stories and you will get your monies worth out of it. Only thing I would like to see happen that I haven't seen yet (it could be in the games and I just haven't come across it yet), is stats on your individual relationship with each character. And maybe when you get the stat high enough or low enough something special can happen in the story. Other than that I recommend spending the money if you like this kind of game.

I absolutely LOVED Rogue's Choice and I cannot wait for Chapter 7 and to see what happens to Dragon/Rooster.  I have to say, after first reading Rogue's Choice, I was slightly disappointed with Wizard's Choice. It seems rushed and not carefully written like Rogue's Choice was. Also, the fact that I had around 200 gold by Chapter 2, as a Wizard, was very frustrating since I went through 6 chapters as a Rogue and had only 30 gold. (Keeping gold rewards small and difficult to attain feels VASTLY more rewarding. I.e. sewer rats)  If I may make a suggestion - keep the protagonists rich in development and keep up the same consistent quality in Rogues Choice - I am SO THRILLED Chapter 7 is nearly done. I can't sleep, so I'm skipping work tomorrow to read this. Fiction is by far, much more interesting than reality. Thank you for providing such rich and pleasant reading and making quality content. Love it.   To any that are skeptical about investing in Premium, just do it.

My only complaint is that my choices doesn't really matter in the long term. Other than points for the ranking and a slightly altered route, the plot and ending remains the same no matter what option you pick. Rather than an interactive fiction with different possible endings, it feels more like a linear game where you win, win better or die. It would also be really cool if the stats didn't reset every chapter. Especially when gold is involved, it's pointless to gather all that gold and not be able to spend it because it keeps resetting every chapter (most notable in Wizard's and Rogue's Choice)!
