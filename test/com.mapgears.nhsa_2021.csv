The app could be improved by allowing users to select rote options. I would also suggest allowing users to select between a topo map and satellite map for the background. There appears to be a missing section of trail 402 between Rindge and Milford. I would also like to have information on the clubs linked to the trails that they maintain.,4,3,1.0.6,2020-12-07 01:53:57,"Hi Todd, thanks for the great review and for pointing out the issue with trail segments.
