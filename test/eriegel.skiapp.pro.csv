The export function throws an error saying it couldn't create the folder (any format). No guidance in the app what could be wrong. 3. There should be a way to see the mountain or a map? In the overview screen there is a ""map view"" button that does nothing.",3,0,2.3.7,2021-02-02 15:41:42,Thanks for the feedback. Questions 2 and 3 are issues due to new restrictions added with Android 10 and 11 which are blocking access of the App to storage. This is not fixed yet in the SkiApp. Question 1: If you stand for more than ~ 30 secons this will be counted as stand still in order not to spoil the average velocity. eriegel@mnet-online.de,2021-02-02 15:52:23
