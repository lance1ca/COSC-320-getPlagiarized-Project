It is really nice to be able to only give permissions to things when using them not behind the sense when you may not even know. Just note if you have issues with alarms, phone calls, it was the do not disturb settings that was the problem for me. I say this cause it too can seem like bouncer is just blocking it all when it is not. Glad I found this out before seeking a refund. Thank you for such an amazing app!!",5,0,,2020-11-17 16:49:52,,
