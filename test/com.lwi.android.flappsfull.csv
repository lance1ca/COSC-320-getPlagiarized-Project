disappears and the app doesn't open back up. When I check under ""Active

have to close the Youtube app completely then reopen it again, losing the 
stopping point of whatever it is I was watching/listening. I use the 
floating Youtube app to listen to audiobooks on Youtube, and the floating 
app allows me to run other apps at the same time or just have the screen 
off so that it the battery doesn't get drained too quickly. However, 
because of this glitch, I constantly have to try to find the place where I 
stopped listening. I've emailed them about the glitch, but only received an 
email back saying they would look into it. The issue is still there after 
some updates. Not sure if the other floating apps have the same issue or 
not because I've only used the Youtube app the most so far. This might also

from loading in windows, when I load certain apps like Facebook using 
floating apps as a Launcher they always open windowed as opposed to 
fullscreen and because of this, Facebook doesn't run correctly because it 
doesn't support being opened in a window aka multi task view. Fix this and 
it's 5 stars all day, almost a perfect app. Emailed back in forth with the 
dev and he had no solutions for this particular problem, such a shame 
because otherwise this app is awesome. Now I'm stuck trying to find an 
alternative Launcher that I can swipe from the side. Update : K, so simple 
solution, don't have your app open other apps in free form mode, it's slow 
and broken, just launch them, bumping this down to 2 stars for repeating 
the same thing over and over blaming Android because your app launches 
other apps incorrectly, thanks",2,0,4.5.7,2018-05-09 16:22:30,Opening installed apps in floating windows is provided via so-called free-form mode which is a part of Android system.

I actually love this app. However, one thing that bothers me is I find the floating quick launch icon to lack usability. While I'm being productive, I don't mind it, but there should be an easy toggle to turn it on and off. As it is, turning it off involves at minimum bringing up settings from the notification drawer. A simple as that sounds, as a power user I have a lot of instant-usability customizations on my phone and there are many more uses for floating windows that I would have if there were more customizations for the quick launch floater. As it is, often the app is prohibitive in steps it takes to hide or display the options when I can also use moto's split screen or the Flynx browser.  Suggestions: most importantly, put ""hide/show quick launch"" in the floating menu. Also put configuration options in the floating menu.   Options to change the color and icon of the quick launch and more ui elements.  Possibly, the use of accelerometer gestures to easily toggle the floating menu? Or let the user calibrate the swipe gesture for bringing it up?  Finally, the close/move/menu bar on top of each window lacks customization options. The enlarged version takes up too much screen rank estate, but the small version is often hard to hit right. A simple slider bar to change the size of this would be great.   Any usability improvements of this nature that lead to me using the app more would definitely result in a 5 star review. Thanks for making Ia great app nonetheless!",3,1,4.3.1,2017-11-25 08:19:49,"Hello,

you can easily enable/disable quick launch icon or the whole app using notification bar or using ""quick tile settings"". We will add these option to Floating Menu too!

Also, the floating menu is going to be completely rewritten in the next update ;-).

I was working on an app called Here's My GPS that is designed to work like a GPS Walkie Talkie for Search and Rescue operations.  We needed a way to superimpose our app over a Skype session so that people would be able to view our live HMGPS view at the same time they were looking at a Skype session being broadcast by one of our searching and rescue ground crew.  My app designers said it could not be done.  I found the Floating Apps in minutes on the Play Store and was able to get it set up and and send a screen shot to my app designers within less than fine minutes proving the functionality was possible and to not worry about designing it because we would just use Floating Apps.  So yes I bought the pro version in a few milliseconds and the Floating Apps people delivered much more than I expected.  I'm giving it only 5 stars because I can't give it 10.  So ....Yes I loved It!!!,5,3,3.3.1,2015-11-05 20:31:15,,
