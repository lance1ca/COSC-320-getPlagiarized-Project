I am used to seeing decks that are basically just variations on the standard Ryder-Waite artwork and interpretation.  This deck has a different slant in both respects.  Will Worthington's artwork is exquisite, with a strong nature-oriented, Ancient Celtic feel.  The drawings themselves and the interpretations have similarities to the standard, but are different enough that they bring something new to it.  You can access the full meanings from  Ryan and Mathews' book.  I like that they give you some options on the spreads, such as using major arcana only.  Another plus is that there ia a journal function, and the individual cards ask questions to help you think more deeply about the reading. This has quickly become one of my favorite tarot apps.
