It's fantastic but I can't give it a 5 star as it stands for several reasons. One is performance in Quake 3 and Open Arena, it's not great as QIII4A beats Quad Touch in this aspect and two is in Hexen 2, pressing the B button on my controller turns me into a sheep... Every single time despite the fact this is relegated to an item in the game, that needs serious fixing asap, it's frustrating. 3 is that it feels unfinished, despite the touch menus being taken straight from Delta Touch, the weapon wheel function isn't working right, custom inputs are keys that can't be remapped within the games leaving you with messages like salute, taunt and wave in Quake 2, thus leaving you unable to rebind their functions in the options menu of the game, it's still rough.
