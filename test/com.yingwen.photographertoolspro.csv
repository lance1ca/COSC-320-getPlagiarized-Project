I never used it for anything else mainly because I didn't know it had any other functions! Flash-forward to today and our over 10 days of chasing Comet Neowise. We get out earlier to see the sunset, then wait about an hour impatiently for the stars to begin shining in the darkening evening sky. We are using up to three different apps at home on a laptop, dumbphones and computers set to the time when we would finally see the Big Dipper (key to finding the comet), once we are on-location at our light-polluted spot we've chose for the grand occasion. Considering we have already previsualized the comet's location on screens at home, it would still take us an average of an hour if not longer to just FIND the comet! All of these apps seem to place Jupiter and Saturn well, along with the Moon, but turn to the NW for our Big Dipper, those apps all lost its accuracy. Even tho calibrated several times on the spot for best results, the dumbphone app and apps used at home would place Big Dipper and comet abt 20 to 35° off and to the east! So two days ago we finally gave up on chasing the comet since we would spend so much time trying to find it as it sinks lower and lower in the sky that we would be getting home well after midnight. Then the wife reads an online writeup about someone using PlanItPro to recently shoot the comet and stated ""it was quite accurate"" in locating the comet!! Remember, we have been using THREE other similar apps that were way off for not only the comet's position, but all our other references we needed to locate the comet. So we decided on a test since I have the PlanItPro app. So after reading the users guides of the virtual viewfinder and star shooting, I understood those functions well enough for an actual test. After checking the app and trying it indoors, we took a short walk and used the V(AR) at the spot where I wanted to capture the comet, then returned home for the wait. Remember, we'd usually would be on location very early to wait for the Big Dipper (about an hour after sunset) to begin our frantic search for the comet. This time though, with PlanItPro already loaded on the screen and now knowing more or less where it would/should be, I insisted on waiting till the Big Dipper was visible, before we were there. Sure enough, later in the darkness, I found the comet within minutes instead of hours! In fact, according to PlanItPro, there were three other comets near Neowise!!! You can bet I will be using this FABULOUS tool called PlanItPro a lot more now, and will be very confident in its tested accuracy! Thanks for such a great app that works wonders IF you read the guides, and is so much more accurate than other apps, and now your app replaces four other apps I used for the ""same"" use!!!",5,1,9.10.3,2020-08-01 10:52:54,,

Currently, however, there are a few bugs that make the app unusable - and they revolve around storage access and permissions. I currently have given the app access to everything it has requested, however, the app still does not have the ability to access the phone's storage, or read photos I've taken with the phone for the 'Viewfinder Picture feature that I would like to use for planning a scene of a target of unknown height. Additionally, I cannot download the elevation files locally because the app still is not maintaining the permissions to access storage on my phone (downloads stay in paused state - pressing 'play' button switches to 'pause' immediately). I've checked the app permission settings for all apps, and PlanIt Pro is listed as having permission to ""Access photos, media, and files on your device."" If these permissions issues aren't fixed, the app is mostly useless to me",2,0,9.10.2,2020-07-30 11:24:14,A new update 9.10.3 is the on the way already which will fix the issue. Android 10 and 11 are no longer allowing us to write to root folder so we will have to do a file migration in the next next release. Otherwise we will not be able to release it on the play store.

Charge a monthly fee. The problem is the paid user could over use the quota (unless we price it very high whcih we really don't want to do). 2. Charge a usage fee as Google does. This way can be easily hacked. Neither way works. Any thoughts?,2019-07-14 22:13:23

The UI can be quite intimidating at first, but once figured out (with the help of the very informative and well-made video tutorials and user manuals prepared by the developer himself), you will come to appreciate why it was designed that way. Features such as “Sun/Moon Finder” and “Milky Way Seeker” simply have no rival among all photography planning apps. The VR view finder is amazing and works differently than the AR view found in other apps such as Sun Surveyor and PhotoPills. VR view allows you to visualize the composition with the focal length of your choice with great precision without having to be present at the planned location. The developer tried to fit many things on the screen and sometimes it can be challenging to access certain items on the screen with your finger, but since my device is a Galaxy Note 8, the S-Pen works very well with the app. The app is actively developed and you can expect very regular updates.",5,12,9.7.4,2018-10-25 03:07:18,,

Love the way it works. There has been a lot of changes since the time I bought my application. Works great.  Love to plan my milkyway and meteorite shots using this.  I am yet to explore all the features of this app.  I have 2 questions:  1. Recently I was trying the Street view for a milky way planning and it seemed to be not smooth at all. I am using it on my Google Pixel.  Is this normal? 2. Is there a way to save the maps for offline use?(If yes how?) Most of the places I go to click the pictures do not have cell coverage and when I use this app in those places I do not get to see the map at all and the app becomes useless.   Suggestions: It would be great if you could have a way to tell what is the meaning of each label on a screen. For e.g. In the Stars interface I don't know what is the Magnitude column in the table. Also it would be great if these columns could be sortable by clicking the column name.,4,1,7.5,2017-08-18 17:41:34,"Streetview is slow because to convert direction to screen coordinate is slow. I couldn't find a solution unless Google fixes it. Google map doesn't support offline. They had it in their own app but didn't provide it to other apps who use Google map.

I have watched the tutorial and am still learning the interfaces.  Certainly more complex than TPE and a bit like a Swiss Army Knife as far as flexibility and applicability to a host of activities.  I do archaeoastronomy documentation in addition to photography and have found the VR view a very useful new tool in my kit. Update:  Through experimentation, I discovered the skyline horizon is very dependent on where the scene icon is placed.  This makes perfect sense in complex terrain with many layers of mountain ridges.  The elevation profile determined from Google Map is analogous to an x-ray slice of a cat scan.  After finding the true obstructing ridgeline (8 km vs 10 km distant), Planit! was spot on in comparison to timing and perspective in reference photos I previously took from the same location.  This is an exceptional product which I highly recommend.",5,2,3.7,2014-12-01 11:25:35,Thanks for the updated and five-star rating :),2014-12-01 13:30:25
