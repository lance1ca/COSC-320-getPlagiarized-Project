Flipping over the phone to start and pause the timer is a surprisingly nice way of controlling a pomodoro. The ""settings"" button in the bottom left corner fit in so well with the rest of the design that I thought it was just a little sun, hence it took me an embarassing amount of time to find it. 4 stars because I'd like a simple statistics page in the settings telling me how long I studied each day/week.
