Borders are cut off and this is definitely a huge disadvantage when playing since it's not possible to place towers in certain fields depending on the map. Otherwise it would be a good game.,3,0,94,2021-01-29 12:58:17,,

Usually lower stars mean frustration but here that's not the case. The dev wishes to player good that's obvious (no scams, no ads, no iap) but the game is somehow boring. Maybe perhaps you can do everything with science towers. No usual armor/resistance mechanic etc. Also the story/world is really lacking. You would expect the name Gold Rush would be tied to gold theme but nope.",4,2,94,2021-01-18 08:44:32,,

It took me at least 5 tries to complete your 3rd level on hard difficulty settings (not even insane ones). That was exectly what I was looking for: an original gameplay with talent tree variety and bosses and a challenging puzzle levels. Totally recommended,5,4,93,2021-01-03 23:37:33,,
