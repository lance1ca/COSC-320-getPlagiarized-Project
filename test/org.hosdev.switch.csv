The dev is friendly and worked with me on getting it working. I won't lie it wasn't very straightforward getting it to work following the tutorial. If dev idiot proofs the guide or better yet posts a video guide I will update to 4 star, maybe 5 depending.] Followed instructions, does not work. Even when I did get it to connect, it would immediately disconnect as soon as I left the change grip/order menu. If devs fix the connection issue I'll change my review.",3,1,1.2,2020-12-27 14:22:39,"Hello! Sorry this happened. Here is how I got around it, I ran into it a few times
1.) Once I got it connected in the controller menu, I hit a bunch of buttons and made sure it was registering before hitting the A button to go back.
2.) Delete the bluetooth connection on the phone and reconnect

Makes it much less tedious to breed for IVs or shinies. I'll just leave it on while working or overnight and come back to boxes of hatched pokemon that I can look through.,5,0,1.2,2020-10-26 16:51:14,,
