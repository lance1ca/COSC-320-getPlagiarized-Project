You can pay the $1.49 and play the entire game. It's no different to the Steam or Switch version. BUT you can also pay to buy stuff and speed up hero's tempa deaths (although we WANT you to see bad that they die and other swap heroes or take a break) But the game is designed to be played with no purchases.

I'll agree with another reviewer in that you do need to play some levels more than once to upgrade your heroes. Or you can play the endless modes once you unlock the to collect money for upgrades. So far I see no need to spend money to beat the game. I've upgraded my heroes to the max and am close to beating the last few campaigns. It does get quite difficult at the last few to beat the campaigns even with all the upgrades. I like that though, and find this game fun and challenging with good graphics, sound effects and weapons. I would recommend it to those who like strategy games, but not the ones everyone else seems to like. I find those games boring myself. I very rarely play mobile games, but have recently gotten into them and the best ones to me have been Plants vs Zombies 2, Ramboat, this games and the Sour Patch strategy game.

Game is very much the same as most tower defense games. The characters are OK but the audio gets old quickly. You don't have to spend money to advance but prepare to do a lot of grinding to make your characters strong enough to survive higher levels. You can earn weapon and armour upgrades quickly but it the passive and active skills that are more important and leveling up takes longer and longer as you advance. Be prepared to re-do levels over and over and over again in order to earn skill points. Sad that it isn't being updated it has a lot of potential.,3,49,1.27,2016-09-26 13:01:14,,

Most commonly for me it messes up how the special abilities are used - either disabling them or making them unlimited, and then once that happens you can't finish a level, even if all the waves are gone it'll just sit there empty. so you have to resign and start the whole level over again.

Either put your game on the market for a fixed price OR make it free with ads or micro-transactions. Personally I prefer the first one.  I understand the need for funding, but this is ridiculous. I've paid full price for the game. I should not be expected to pay anything else to experience the game in full. Things that can be unlocked now with 'gems' or whatever they are should be unlocked naturally as you progress through the game.

I did pay 3 dollars for it after all. If there is a need for in-app purchases at least make the game free. And as said before LOWER THE VALUE OF SOME OF THE GUNS. Edit: Developer replied to me and I have raised it one star since they do have a point.

It has a few glithces.

I am not upset about that, but as I finish the level and kill all the enemies, it does nothing. I can select the heroes, they talk, but they don't move. Tried pressing pause but it's not working either. The only good thing about it is I've managed to buy the expensive weapons :) I know this is not something you desire to ""fix"" in the user's favour, as the in app purchases would be useless, but it's information that hopefully will help you to improve the game.

It should also be a lot clearer that a tower has been completely destroyed because sometimes I go 2 minutes without even realising it, it'd be good if a little box came up saying its been damaged then has the option to repair it. Last thing is that it should have a graphics menu as there are a lot of particles and generally a good looking game. Good game though, like the gameplay.",4,5,1.0.5,2014-05-23 09:35:03,"Thanks Jamie, we're working on updates now that include minor tweaks such as you described.
