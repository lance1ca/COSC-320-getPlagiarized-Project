Something that needs addressing tho is the troop ships on skirmish. Once the Units land, they can't sail over to reinforce other positions when they've captured their own objectives. An example of this Is the star Beach map. If it's to the death, even if you defeat the enemy on one front you can't move troops back into boats to engage them on the other side. This results in having to prematurely end the game. Can this be resolved?",5,59,2.32,2020-12-18 04:56:59,,

It's closely relatable to a very strange and large game of chess. You have to think ahead of the A.I. constantly and micro manage your troops which results in a single round taking nearly 15-30 minutes. I played first on the second easiest difficulty but I realized at the Somme that it is near impossible for the Central Powers to win. Even with machine guns and full lvl 6 trenches even now on the easiest.,3,17,2.1,2020-03-04 11:10:35,Thanks for the feedback. Will consider making some changes to the difficulty.,2020-03-04 16:42:59

Online multiplayer is also gonna be fantastic, even though it might get me and my brother fired for never doing any work at our jobs. I only have a few issues / bugs I see with this game. If you quit out of the game (on tablet) mid turn, it resets your BP points. It always feels like cheating to use them. Also can you put in a 'are you sure' button when you click end turn, if not all your men have moved? I have clicked end turn accidentally a few times when I actually want to just quit for the night, not end my turn. Of course it means I miss a whole turn.

First: this game is so good, and made with so much effort, that i just demand that you charge more money for it.  Second: A few more maps for sandbox would be awesome.  I would even help out with maps if I had any idea how that works.  Third: The corpses have a few problems:becaus they fall only one way, back, it looks like many lines of dead bodies, wich looks weird, but also, the veteran infantry has the same corpses as normal ones.  Fourth: I know, running the servers for online play will cost to much, but please introduce at least local multiplayer.  Fith: Just make a collection of your games and take 25 bucks for it on steam.

I only have 4 criticisims. 1: The sandbox does not let you make your own maps and the few that you do get can get boring after awhile. 2: You cannot chose where to deploy your troops. 3: There are only a few different units. 4: The army sizes are somewhat small and you can get a max of 60 land units and maybe ships.,5,2,1.02,2019-06-02 18:42:37,Thank you for your suggestions!

There is no resources collection/management.   The campaign mode involves a series of battles. Each battle has a unique, fairly big map, with varied terrain, and terrain effects (e.g., city squares improve defense but cost more movement). Units left undisturbed on open/plain squares will 'dig-in', improving defense. Each battle starts with a brief explanation of where it fits within the history of WWI. Battles have different victory objectives, so it's not just wipe out the enemy.   There are a lot of unit types, each with varied capabilities. If units take enough damage they become disorganized and/or run away. Disorganized units combat effectiveness is reduced, but can be restored if the unit is undisturbed for one turn.   You can play either Allies or Central Powers, effectively doubling replay-ability.  Suggestions: If you check attack options after moving a unit, you can't undo the move; Please allow the player to check attack options and undo move. The icons for Russian normal and veteran infantry are visually identical; Please update the icons to be visually distinct (there may be other cases like this).",4,1,1.02,2019-01-02 09:26:58,Thanks for the review!

Do you plan on adding air units to this game? Or maybe Snipers (Good against infantry at long range, bad against other units)    I personally think that machine guns should deal a bit less damage to tanks, as in reality bullets can't do much damage to heavily armored vehicles. Also, the tanks should move a little slower, as WWI tanks were newly invented and had very slow move speed, and were better suited for taking trenches.  Finally, do you plan on adding minefields? Also, would you consider adding a single battle from each of your other games as well? Many people like me would like to buy all your games, but can't get all of them, and this would help us decide. Thanks!",5,0,1.02,2018-08-03 19:11:43,Air units are coming and snipers are a possibility. Machine gun damage to tanks will be fixed. Interesting thought about the speed of tanks and minefields.

I cant even imagine how good it will be in WW II Edit: Is there any other 
way to support you. I feel like I should repay you for making this master 
piece Edit 2.0: I suggest adding an Officer unit who can for ex. Speed up 
entrenchment, improve accuracy for 1-2 tiles ,improve defence/attack to 
nearby units (in proximity of 5 tiles for example). Allow in sandbox for us 
to make our maps, like add units trenches etc., that can help in creation 
of other maps, or just make a Discord (I know there are the forums) where 
it can possibly be easier for us to send screenshots of glitches and bugs 
aswell as talk to you. If I get any new possible ideas, Ill probably leave 
them here. Thats all I got for now",5,0,1.02,2018-07-29 10:44:44,Thanks! I am planning a WW2 game.

For example, in the waterloo game, infantry has a range of 2 square, napoleonic muskets could occasionally hit at 200 meters so that roughly matches up if we are to assume each square is 100 meters. The same scale is used for this game and it's fairly inappropriate, ww1 rifles could shoot fairly far. In addition, I'm not sure what the unit scale is but German Battalions in 1914 had approximately 1000 men as opposed to 600. Other than the esoteric issue I mentioned it's a good game but I think the waterloo game is more historically accurate.",4,15,1.02,2017-08-09 04:53:03,"To be honest, I don't have a figure in mind when it comes to distance scale as I prefer go with the ""whatever feels right"" method. Paper strength of battalions were often said to be approximately 1000 men, but in battle the number of fighting men was often far fewer, even before taking casualties. So I decided that 600 would be a reasonable figure.",2017-08-10 17:36:27

I've only played on normal difficulty so far which is fairly forgiving, as many is the time I've seen a fairly healthy unit flee in terror from a poor choice, but still been able to recover due to Ai's lack of aggresion. The game looks very pretty to, and even though the art is fairly simple, it leaves quite a striking end game battlefield, with bodies and trenches littering the battlefield.
