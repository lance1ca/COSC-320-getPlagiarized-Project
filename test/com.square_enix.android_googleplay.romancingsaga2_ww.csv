If you expect to play this like another Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest game then you will get filtered HARD after a certain point. Learn the mechanics and think outside the box and you will be rewarded with a unique JRPG like no other. How fun and how much enjoyment you get out of this game depends on how you play.

Just because this runs on Android devices doesn't make this a fast-paced game. This isn't a game to rush through - it's a true gem from the developers. I wish I'd known about this series a long time ago (as a kid I played FF3(us) aka FF6, Secrets of Mana & Evermore, and Chrono Trigger on the SNES. Those were/are my favorite single player games of all time, even after being a committed 'gamer' for the two decades to follow their release). The gameplay has the nostalgic charm (npc's walk in place, fun cutscenes, content drips in smoothly as characters develop, and the townsfolk - the townsfolk!!). It also has a new level of difficulty and excitement - characters have their own proper life points that can run out, so they can die permanently - there's also so much nonlinear content in this game - it's really hard to believe that it preceded some of the other trailblazing titles I mentioned. You can explore the world all you want (like an open-world game type of experience if you enjoy those). If your party gets wiped out, you might not be able to return to where you were so easily in the future. It's pretty awesome. Don't cheat with walkthroughs. Give it a shot. Just don't rush through it. The controls are completely workable if you pay attention to them. Also, save often!! But if your party gets wiped out, try to get yourself to take the chance to rebuild your party from the ground up (instead of reloading your file) - this is a really unique feature that sets this game apart!!",5,34,1.03,2017-06-07 12:51:11,,

I played it when it originally came out on the SFC in 1993. And through the years I replay it at least once a year in Japanese. Today, a 23 year wait is over. Some tips for new players to the series: get magic research center up early. You need 25 mp on your emperor and 1m in coins. Also, the best weapons are generally found but the best armor is generally made.",5,35,1.00,2016-05-28 21:10:23,,

Wow. Before someone comes in whining about why a game involving massive amounts of time and money to create would cost 17 dollars, I want to tell them: this game isn't for you.  You will not understand, nor would this game likely be in your bag. If, however, you would like to finally play one of the best JRPGs to never be released in America, I'd like to happily reassure you: yes, it's as good as they say. If you played any of the Saga games and dug them, come on in!! Just keep the haters out.",5,7,,2016-05-27 17:34:50,,
