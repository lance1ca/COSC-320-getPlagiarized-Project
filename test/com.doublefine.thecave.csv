First off, this is the kind of game there needs to be more of. It's fun, engaging, humorous and challenging. You can play it multiple times with the different characters. This is game is heads and shoulders above 95% of the dreck out there in this regard. So why only 3 stars? The controls are ABYSMAL! The jump mechanic alone is enough to make you scream. Watching my character impaled for the umpteenth time in a pit of spikes really sucks the fun out. Apparently you can connect a controller... but then why have it mobile. Just play on the XBox... If you have the patience to deal with the control scheme, get it. Otherwise still get it... just on a different platform.",3,9,1.1.9,2018-11-20 16:44:11,,

The characters are quirky with their own maze adventures. You play with three characters and you need to use two/three of them to complete some of the puzzles which is great to get you problem solving. I admit I did use the walk through guide online as I knew what I needed to do but couldn't work out how to interact objects with the controls. Hours of fun, and once completed with three characters you can play again with different people all with different skills. Mostly easy enough but with some brain teasers to get you really thinking but i would definitely recommend.",5,0,1.1.9,2018-02-18 01:27:32,,

I moved the tablet to get a strong WiFi signal and watched the progress report. I didn't start it up right away but continued reading the Guardian App.   When I started The Cave it helpfully created a shortcut on my home screen and told me how many GB space I'd got left. But it didn't work. At all.   Because I waited more than 15 minutes before trying it, no refund button appeared in the Google Play store.

Controls took a while to get used to. My problem was that I expected the characters to stop the moment I lift my finger from the screen. But that's not how the controls work. The characters walk to the last position of your finger.   To jump it is actually enough to just touch the screen above the obstacle: the key element is to have your finger higher on a vertical pane than your character. There is no need to swipe an arc or some other finger flexing. The cave isn't really a platformer game, it is a puzzle solving adventure game. I mean: you can't even die !
