Why do I always have to login again every time I turn on the app to backup my data? Why are there like 4 or 5 buttons on the workout screen, all of them with different options? The only thing on my workout screen should be my exercises (sets and reps), weights and a timer. All the extra options and settings, just keep them in a separate menu. Why does the app respond terribly to landscape mode? Why is there even a landscape mode, when it's not even needed in the first place?

again, you've already heard of this or done it. Only thing I would change 
is maybe allow for custom rep count so i could work in some volume during 
warm-up and actually keep track of it. This program is a bit light on upper 
body, but that's ok for beginners. Build strong base. Don't be that guy who 
benches more than he deadlifts",5,1,1.18,2018-06-12 07:59:22,,

It makes determining warmup weights a breeze which is very helpful since I use a home gym.

I tested updates and everything looks great! New features, a more handsome UI and everything running smooth! This is what you want from a paid app! A company that isn't resting on its laurels and is attentive to its user-base to make a useful and functional product!  Old review: Let me start by saying I LOVE the starting strength program. Seeing weight increase on the bar every workout when you're starting out is so exciting and an extreme motivating factor to make sure I'm getting into the gym 3 times a week. This app has some great features but it is VERY buggy. Editing workout notes? Cool. Wanna hop back to a different spot of the note? Nope. It minimizes your keyboard. Wanna start it up fresh? Cool. Wanna open it after you had it up yesterday? Nope. It freezes so you gotta force stop it so it can start fresh again. I don't begrudge the $9 since there's a ton of information in the app and an enormous amount of learning resources online. I'm glad to give starting strength the money for how much I've learned but the app has a lot of room for improvement",5,2,1.17,2017-06-30 19:24:36,"Hey Matthew, thanks for the review.

Let's get one thing out of way: the knowledge imparted by the trainers (Rippetoe et al.) is top notch.  They are extremely knowledgeable with decades of experience and they've built a solid plan that can get you really strong in a very efficient manner.    That being said, this app has enough technical misses that make it something less than stellar.    The interface is mostly OK, but suffers from various annoying quirks.  For example, the countdown function is very clunky and will reset if you navigate to other parts of the app.  The separation between regular and warm up sets is also not intuitive and unnecessarily complicated.  Perhaps the most annoying thing though is the the app is surprisingly sluggish even on a relatively new phone (Galaxy S7 Edge).  There are noticeable lag times in almost every action.    This app will likely get most comparison to ""5x5 StrongLifts"" which at this time, is superior due to its much better performance and interface.  I believe the Rippetoe training method itself to be better though.  FWIW, this app does show promise.",3,0,1.17,2017-04-26 04:14:03,"Thanks Kai, we're hoping with the coming update that many of those issues are resolved.

I began seriously training using another popular, similar, program but found myself stalling and on a few occasions injuring myself, causing me to stop for weeks to recover. Once I switched to Starting Strength I noticed a difference almost immediately. I quickly surpassed my previous maxes in a matter of a couple weeks. The only downside to this is that I now have to buy more plates because I just pulled everything I have. The app is simple and easy to use. Well worth the few bucks for the log book and progression charts along with quick access to the book and plenty of other little goodies. My only qualm is that you can't specify the number of each weight plate that you have for the plate calculator. (IE 1 set of 45s, 35s, etc, etc) I find myself just not using the plate calculator and adding it up myself even though it usually takes me a few rounds of adding to double check my math. No one wants to have to take their focus away from the set they are setting up for to do math.    Overall it is a fantastic app that is simple and to the point and that's what makes it great. What really sold me on it was the plate calculator, so I was a bit disappointed when I realized it just didn't work like I had hoped for. I would gladly give the app 5 stars if this was updated.",4,0,1.17,2017-04-13 18:07:56,"Thanks Graham, setting the number of plates is something I've got on our to-do list.",2017-05-04 16:49:39

These guys have gone out of their way to provide answers. 5-star support and a 5-star app. Also, man, it's like little turkeys crawled into my thighs while I was sleeping. The gainz are real, bro.  The app manages and organizes everything very efficiently, which helps you focus on what matters -  lifting with good form. Performance wise, it does get a bit hung up. This often occurs when clicking 'back' or using the rest timer. The bar loading illustration is a fantastic addition, but you can't adjust the plate inventory to merely two 10 lbs plates instead of the default 4 10 lbs plates. Be nice to specify exact plates (and count) you have available. Love it, and I'm sure it's only going to get better.",5,0,1.16,2016-09-03 15:32:06,"Thanks Garth, I'm updating the warmup calculator in the next update, feel free to email me at hello@shabu.co with any suggestions as I didn't quite understand what you meant with 2 x 10lb instead of 4 x 10lb plates.

No more switching between three different apps! Well worth the $13 that I paid.   I noticed that there is an option to add chin ups, which I am planning to do in a few weeks time when I start alternating my dead lifts and power cleans on day A. (As recommended by Rip) I would also be alternating chin ups with pull ups on day B. Would it be possible to add a feature to accommodate for this? (And also the switching of pull ups/chin ups)  So for example: Day A - Squats, Press, Dead lift Day B - Squats, Bench, Chin ups, Day A 2 - Squats, press, power cleans Day B 2 - Squats, bench, pull ups   And then back to Day A. Not sure how you could program it into the already existing UI but I thought I would put it out there as I know there are others that would benefit from this. :)  Edit: Thanks for the reply! I look forward to the future updates, keep up the good work!

Only hiccups that i cant add a weight with a decimal place, eg, 52.5kg,  which is annoying seeing as we progress in increments of 2.5. Other than that it's spot on.

Every time you minimise the app, you have to refill in the details about previous exercises. This is quite a pain. 2. would be better if there was an option for barbell rows to replace cleans 3. Option to record reccomended aux. Exercises (pullups+dips).   N.b. I understand 2+3 are controversial however they are also quite popular!",3,1,1.08,2015-09-10 08:21:49,"Minimise app / reload todays progression is fixed in the current update (1.13).

It's much easier to determine if you are progressing by comparing the number of reps done to the previous workout, especially when you start to plateau. Overall, I am really impressed with your app. 10/10 for now. 11/10 if you can keep track of reps",5,0,1.08,2015-09-09 21:28:02,Michael you can now use the notes function to count missed reps.

Clean and easy to use. The app feedback button doesn't seem to work, FYI. For future updates, I'd like to see: warm up sets calculations, ability to add additional/alternative lifts (i.e. chin-ups, back extensions, etc), and the ability to input past workouts.  (EDIT: Thanks for the clarification! I've added past workouts.)",5,0,1.08,2015-09-09 18:47:49,"You can enter previous workouts in the ""Training History"" Section, press the ""+"" button in the bottom right hand corner.
