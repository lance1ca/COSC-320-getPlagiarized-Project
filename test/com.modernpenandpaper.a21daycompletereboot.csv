For instance today is day 10 for me but I just added the app today to help me keep on track and a reminder to your phone would be amazing too...but this app is the best one I have tried, by far :)",5,0,1.5,2015-11-14 10:37:20,"Hi MacKenzie, Thank you for the review!  During the initial setup and the setup of each cycle (including reset of a cycle ;) ) you can select which day you are on by changing the Start Date - last screen in Setup.  Changing the Start Date will give you your Current Day (ie., 10)  Please email me! Email address in Guidance section.  Thank you - Tony",2015-11-14 12:55:53
