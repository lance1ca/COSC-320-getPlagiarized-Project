It's mostly a streamlined take on that game (e.g. far fewer racial special abilities), but it's not lacking depth (e.g. each and every ship can be customized and there is some degree of micro-management necessary to keep one's population fed). This isn't a MOO2 clone, to be clear, but that game's influence is definitely prevalent, in a good way, and has been improved upon (e.g. multiple smaller Guardian-style ships instead of a single monolithic one). The rich UI can take a bit of getting used to, but it is quite elegant (far, far more-so than MOO3's was), providing easy access to all levels of interface with a minimal number of clicks. Auto-saving makes it easy to hop in and out of the game and several manual-save slots make it easy to experiment and roll back to a ""known-good"" state.

I have some feedback and improvement requests: 1) Add a Race symbol on ship icon in ""ship in route"" screen - This will make it easier to tell who is attacking your planets. 2) Add ship experience points - This will let individual ships get bonuses the more they are used. It will also make it worthwhile to refit an old ship instead of sacrificing it to the nearest enemy. 3) Add ship captains - Captains with added bonuses or abilities will give ships even more customization and help make the AI enemies tougher in the MID game turns. 4) I noticed that Blockaded planets do not rebuild destroyed Torpedo Turrets Overall this is a fantastic game and it makes time fly when you are stuck waiting for your friends or family.",5,4,22.2,2020-01-09 15:04:22,,

It's this that is probably making the game easier than it should be. 2. There should be more money making techs. (I've only seen 2 and they were both 10%). When you take trade goods off, the colonies are always losing money making it difficult to build anything. 3. I would like to be able to continue playing after victory. It let me continue after a coalition victory (on hotseat) but not the conquest victory (on normal). I like to take over the whole universe just because I can muhahaha. 👹 4. Would like to be able to set colonies to trade goods or auto from the colony list screen instead of going to each planet (especially when you are doing the 50 systems heheh) Definitely the best dollar I ever spent.

having all stars visible in one screen). My main complaint is that I 
suspect some RAM leakage, possibly due to mutually recursive calls. 
Whatever the reason it causes the app to crash in extensive session 
(usually many hours), but with frequent saving this becomes a minor issue. 
I also wish for better handling of the 'Back' button, so that backing to a 
menu screen from a submenu screen always gives the same result as when 
tapping the icon for that menu screen. Also, when tapping 'Back' on the 
home screen the app should NOT exit directly, but should display an exit 
confirmation prompt (to avoid losing unsaved progress). These changes are 
extra important for those who play using TV-connected android consoles, 
using mouse instead of touchscreen. An accidental right-click (=='Back') 
should not terminate the game...",5,3,1758,2018-06-23 21:50:20,"Thank you for the review and feedback! I'm pretty confident we can add a confirmation when exiting, I'll talk to my brother about seeing if we can.

Civilization Revolution 2 (which goes for $9.99) and many other 4X mobile 
games. The empire management has just enough depth to keep the game 
interesting but not too deep to devolve the game into a monotonous, 
cumbersome mess. I really like how multiple empires can vie for the same 
solar system and can control a planet within it along with their enemies. 
It makes for an interesting situation. I do have a few suggestions to 
improve the game, since you're asking for feedback and are willing to 
continue improving: 1. Please include a zoom function. This can make the 
world seem much, much bigger. This will give the feeling of far-spread 
interstellar battles for control of the galaxy. 2. The ship designs should 
automatically upgrade to the best researched equipment. Everyone is going 
to apply the best equipment anyways and it's an unnecessary task. 3. Add 
some depth to the on-ground battles. At this stage it feels like it was 
rushed and perhaps a little too much for release as you're only two guys. 
Final thought: $.99 is too little for the value of the game and for the 
work you have put in. I would easily pay $3 and I'm sure with some more 
improvement most others would willingly pay since it's only two dollars 
more. Make the improvements, charge us $3, triple your profits, and release 
a sequel in a year or so. Thanks guys.",5,1,1732,2018-05-13 18:45:31,,

complaint I have is that the AI is kinda easy to beat, even on hard 
difficulty? Update: I made a personal list with ideas/thoughts, maybe you 
find some useful: ###Bugs### - if a tech you started researching gets 
finished due to a ""research bonus"" when you explore a planet, it doesn't 
force you to start a new one at the same turn, only next turn - population 
that gets shipped doesn't need any food??? - when a tribe visits your 
galaxy and you see them for the first time and attack them, it will send 2 
messages, one where they greet and one where they declare war. It shouldn't 
be like that ###Ideas### #Small ideas# - enable player to continue playing 
after battle is over (if won) - enable player to use ""magnifying glasses"" 
in battles to check HP of enemy units etc. - add button to speed up battle 
- many things aren't explained anywhere. What is XYZ doing? Add a clickable 
question mark that briefly explains it - add a 101 help button that briefly 
explains stuff and the basic concept of the gam #Start abilities# - units 
move 1 ly quicker - all planets +10 energy - ships +10% HP - ships +15% 
component space - ships cost -10% - charisma bonus: you can easier ""make 
friends/deals"" with other tribes #Post-game stats# You play so long and 
when it's all over you don't see any stats - show number of technologies 
researched - show chart of all time maximum population of all planets 
combined - show chart of military units (used points and free points) - 
show all time gold - show number of planets - maybe show stats of other 
tribes too ###Tweaks### #AI# A good AI is really important in a game that 
only offers offline play - (hard) AI shouldn't keep sending units (that 
can't attack) to planets when they already sent some and got owned 
previously - AI should remember my ships (amount and tier) on a planet and 
attack in future once strong enough. Maybe also send a scout to maybe check 
if it's a good time to attack - AI shoukd check with how many ships I 
attack and defend accordingly. Also it should speed up the production if 
it's really important #Exploits# - you can check the technologies of all 
tribes, even if they are in war with you. You can check what they have and 
kinda abuse that. It should only show technologies if you are in a 
friendship or so?",5,5,1732,2018-04-28 12:57:37,Thanks for the review! Yeah I want to make it harder. The hardest setting should be almost impossible feeling. Where even the veteran strategy player would struggle playing it.,2018-04-26 09:31:58

I feel strongly that all games and especially ones that cost any money (not because I don't support paying for games, I do, but because 99% of free games include that feature) should include the basic ability to flip the screen. It's a feature that is very abundantly implemented well. It seems like assuring that a common, essential feature doesn't cause issues that significantly worsens the experience of the game would be one of the first things to be looked at and fixed. I'm not a developer and I know it may be unfair of me to try to imagine what should be prioritized, but as a user I feel that at this point it shouldn't even be a question as to whether or not you should be able to rotate your screen.   Think about chargers. It's a battery taxing game.  Besides that the game just isn't a fantastic one. You can't see how much something costs to maintain per turn, you can only advance turns in the map, you can't cancel ships after you click build, the entire screen other than the no button acts as a yes button when selling buildings, and the graphics are extremely low resolution. It's just not an impressive game at all",1,1,1709,2018-04-02 08:01:10,"We are looking at a possible solution that should work. And we understand, I can't stand when the charger is on the side facing away from where it's plugged in. 

It's a feature we had working great until we added new languages. But it's just the auto rotate that causes it. We might do a toggle button where you can pick which way you want it.",2018-04-03 23:11:16

I saw AI ships travel 26 rounds through the galaxy. Only later I saw it was a wormhole.   Also I would like to suggest a feature: Right now, any research and productivity is lost, if it is more than the task requires. As a result the optimal play style is a constant reallocation between research and production on all planets in order to prevent waste of worker time. Please allow any unused production to be used for the next items in the queue. Maybe allow multiple items in the queue to finish in one turn.

Maybe the UI needs more time to mature but the gameplay is superb for this niche genre that's historically PC-only. Issues I've found (or feature?): Queuing a Ship Refit then canceling the order removes the ship(s) completely. While there is a prompt screen before a queue is removed, it's just weird that our imaginary shipyard engineers somehow destroyed(?) them when they were just supposed to realistically recommission those after cancelling a refit. I came across a scenario where I ordered a few ships for refit and a large enemy fleet attempted to attack. I imagined the admiral ordering an ""emergency launch"" protocol but the guys at the shipyard hit self-destruct instead... damn that stupid big red button... Update: it also needs more 'win' or end-game conditions and better diplomacy options; the shipyard thing was a prob from an earlier ver and I avoided  doing that so i cant tell if its still a bug",5,6,1688,2018-02-16 04:04:39,"Hahaha yeah that's not ok...

As someone who has played Masters of Orion and Civilization (all of them), this game is on the right track to be as popular and fun as they have been. Understanding it is still a work in progress, the improvements and updates are noticable. It takes a little time to figure some things out, but that's part of the fun. I have only encountered one glitch during the game that happened twice now and someone else mentioned it happening to them, and that is where my ship(s) are suddenly stuck somewhere with no possible routes or destinations available. I have had to sell the ship(s) to move past that issue. It seems random and rare, but still something to look into. One suggestion I would make is to have the game notify you when a colony ship has arrived at its destination. Quite often I will forget I sent a colony ship somewhere and when I finally remember, another race usually has taken the planet I have wanted.

BUT 4 stars because of the following:  1. Replay is low.  The same strategy (alliances, focus on farming and farming tech) seems to work on every map / race.  2. WAY too much micro.  By midgame, I'm just annoyed by the clicking and the game starts to slow down, making it even more annoying.  Auto build is okay, but makes a lot of poor choices.  Ship editing is cool, but super tedious as I have to edit each one, every time a new tech is out.  Perhaps a quick ""upgrade all ship designs to this tech"" button after the tech is done.  Sending population to new colonies is also tedious.  Change the send population screen to allow you to quickly select a from and a to in one screen without finding the from planet on the map.  Or offer the menu automatically when you settle a new planet?  3. Lack of a manual.  I don't even know what an outpost is for after 4 victories.... electricity seems somewhat meaningless.  4. Try to make V2 a focus on shorter, less grindy games.  The tech tree could be half as long and it would be a better game.
