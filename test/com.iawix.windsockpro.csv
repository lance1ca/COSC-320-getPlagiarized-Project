METAM was my go-to for years, but it's no longer supported. This app is very good. The customizable Zulu clock is perfect. The layout is great. Dark mode is great. The only thing I wish it had is D-ATIS. He makes another app for that, but it'd be nice to have it in this one. Overall great product. Thanks!",5,0,1.0,2020-12-27 15:36:42,,

As an airline pilot I've used several. Pd the $1.58 for the Pro version to support the product. (The pro features are OK. Nothing special for my needs.) I really like the AP!!,5,1,1.0,2020-04-10 16:48:37,Thank you for the review!  As a fellow airline pilot I hope I've included features my peers enjoy using.

But would find local airports. Spent the $3.75 to unlock all of the features, still couldn't search for what I was looking for. This is perfect, with the $.99 to upgrade to Pro for the color coded precipitation.
