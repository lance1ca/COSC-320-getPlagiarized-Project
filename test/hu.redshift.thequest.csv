heavy damage dealing attacks which armor doesn't contribute to its defence. 
This will be before you can close the gap on them or even once toe to toe.

It reminds me of a mobile version of Morrowind. At least, it will probably be the closest thing we can get to it. There are different classes, armor, weapons, spells, monsters, towns, NPCs, quests, etc... The quests can be a little annoying because they are mostly fetch quests. Some quests also don't tell you what attribute they will check for success and thus you can lose because your ""charm"" skill wasn't high enough. However, this just adds to the challenge of the game.

It has all the in-depth character customization I want, although I'm not a fan of how 4/5 races have negative magic resistance.   I'm also not a fan of how vague most quest descriptions and hints are, especially when the hints are often misleading. Ex: A quest detail will name an area to search for something, and the solution will be in an area different from the one named.   Overall, this game has some annoyances, but is still definitely worth the price and is a lot of fun for the character customization aspect.",4,3,4.0.5,2017-07-20 12:02:25,,

A little light on text/story for now, the quests being rather basic in their plots, but I haven't gone past the second town yet so it might change. Inventory management is alright, I can store stuff inside containers, and the stuff hasn't disappeared yet, so I hope they are permanent storage (earlier I had stored my stuff in the Matras storeroom, which seemed perfect with all its containers in close proximity and with its door to the town, but some time later I found the path walled off and had to reload a much earlier save to get my items back &gt;.&lt;). The ability to put notes on the map is very useful, though it would be even better if you could put notes of several colors instead of just green ones, so for example you could tell apart immediately the notes you put about npcs, those about monsters, and those about doors and portals. The common monsters are supposed to respawn, which is good, but I haven't found that to be the case except with monsters in caves (or maybe it takes a lot longer for those on the main map ?). I was happy to find plenty of herbs to pick up, but I cleaned those around the first two towns very quickly and sadly after 25 in-game days they haven't respawned anywhere, so I don't know if they are supposed to. Also, there are some bugs, two of which were especially annoying. The first appeared after a few days and was a constant crash of Google Play Services when the game starts and tries to login to Google Play Games before accessing cloud storage, which caused an error in the login process, and no connection to Google Play and no cloud storage. It disappeared when I did a factory data reset on my tablet after manually copying my saved files and hasn't reappeared, at least not yet. The second is still there to annoy me : one of the first quests is to find a boy (Onan I think ?) near Matras for the agent recruiter, and I ignored it for some time as I wanted to explore a bit. When I finally got around to do it, I talked to the boy, conviced him, when to his brother, and then back to the boy who agreed to let me lead him to the recruiter and disappeared. So far so good, but once I went back to the recruiter's house, I did not have any conversation topic concerning the boy, the only options being ""Why are you here"", ""about the village"", ""about the governor"", and ""hail to Mersant"". Therefore I can't finish this quest, even though it is still active in my journal.",4,4,2.0.7,2017-03-31 03:41:50,"Hi, can you send us a save file to check that quest? Thanks!",2017-03-31 07:09:36
