I have red-green color blindness. I can distinguish colors enough to play and enjoy the game.

All attempts to purchase result in drawing a previously received character. We have fewer than a quarter of the character collection, so the odds that neither of us are drawing new characters should be very low. Combined, we've gone over 10 straight draws without receiving something new!",3,11,1.0.1,2017-09-18 15:35:34,,

It's not supposed to take a long time to retry, so we'd like to know the details of the wait.

Wasn't expecting this to even come out on Android. As for some feedback, can you please fix the way you retry levels while on that level. Whenever I lose any level or want to retry while on the middle of it I get loaded back to the map and prompted to play the same level again. Instead of going back to the map, can you just reset the level and load it up again. I would also like it if you could make this game compatible to more devices. Thanks for listening, and keep up the good work!",4,6,1.0.0,2017-08-22 10:23:56,,
