A few things bother me about it. It won't let me cange the cache folder, no matter what I chose it says it's invalid and goes back to default. Also it doesn't let you enter the server settings without allowing location access which I find real annoying. Fix these two issues and it'll work just the same as dsub with a subjectively slightly better ui.",3,0,3.9,2021-02-01 15:17:32,,

You need to know your server's public IP address and configure 4040 port forwarding, i.e. can't use it with only a local IP address.

They download them delete themselves immediately. Browsing folders with large album art enabled, the pixel size is way too small causing the images to greatly distort. Navigation icons on the now playing screen are too small with way too much white space. The transition effect when going from Now Playing to Playlist is laggy and unnecessary.
