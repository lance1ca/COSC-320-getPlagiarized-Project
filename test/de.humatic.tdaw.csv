Mimics a Mackie Control and then some. The documentation is very thorough but is very technical. It assumes the user already has a large amount of knowledge not just of midi and music production but also of computers and networking. UPDATE. After months of use app stopped connecting. Don't know if it's RTP or the app but since the app requires RTP it doesn't matter. I'm switching to something stable. Pity. It had worked great.,2,13,2.0.8,2021-01-29 02:37:56,,

Think about this: buy a large Android tablet (Galaxy View, Hp Slate 20, Lenovo Yoga Tab 2 Pro, etc) used for approx $200, pay less than $6.00 for Touch daw and you actually have a system that will rival, the Slate system costing 6 times that amount.

Can control/trigger my hardware synths, software synths, and DAW (Sonar X2) with my tablet over WIFI - with an average of 5ms latency!  Considering hardware controllers cost 100s of dollars, this is 80-90% as good for a lot less money.  Granted you dont have the precise/tactile control of hardware sliders/rotaries, or velocity sensitivity on the pads/keys, but it is certainly very usable in many scenarios.   Setup might be confusing for some, but they have a manual online that might help. rtpMIDI works fine under Win7x64 - and you dont need the Apple Bonjour cr@p so ignore the warning. If you dont have a strong N WIFI signal near your gear, then I'd recommend the USB tethering if your device supports it.
