The graphics are really good, the environments are lovely to look at and the story is fun and pretty engaging.   But the puzzles. Ohhh the puzzles. They are SO GOOD. I play a lot of these kinds of games and I'm pretty darn harsh on this point, but Facility 47 just keeps throwing creative after creative puzzle at you. Every time I used a hint, I felt silly that I hadn't thought of the solution. And when I did solve a few of the better puzzles, I actually giggled out loud in satisfaction. My ONLY gripe is that you probably will use a hint or two. Not because the puzzles are obtuse or poorly designed, but because you always have access to every screen previously visited. This means searching for a missed clue or item or puzzle can be extremely difficult. The game usually doesn't make you back track all that far, but it does raise the game's difficulty somewhat unnecessarily.    That point aside, if you are at all looking for a creative adventure puzzler, GET THIS NAO.
