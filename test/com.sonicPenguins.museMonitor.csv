As James - the developer of MuseMonitor - explains there are 2 reasons :    1) During eye movement there are electrical (non brain) signals that make big slow (relatively) arcs  in the raw data. These electrical currents interfere with the brain data, especially in the lowest  frequency band and causes Delta to rise. So – while recording a session – try to avoid eye movements.    2) It is due to the kind of FFT (fast fourier) calculation the Muse headset uses.  Because the EEG wave bands represent a power spectrum, their values will vary exponentially,   meaning the lower-frequency bands (such as delta and theta) will be exponentially larger values   than the higher-frequency bands (alpha and beta).""  so when u say 'exponentially larger' ,what does this exactly mean? lets say for example muse monitor shows in DB 100 for delta,80theta,60alpha,40beta,20gamma - what would the 'real' numbers b?",5,6,2.0.10,2018-09-20 09:06:45,"The short answer is they are the real numbers. The lowest freq result of an FFT is subject to the largest amount of error. This error is exponential rather than linear; you get much more error in the lower freqs (both inherently and due to error), then it tapers off very quickly as the numbers rise.

You can't view the graph recording on the app.  You have to export to a computer and then it is an Excel sheet.    Why can't you record for five minutes and then scroll backward through that recording right in the app? When I meditate my eyes are closed so I would like to scroll through the results on my phone after I'm done.  Not quite sure how to read the graphs.  And there's no explanation on how to read the graphs either on the app or on the website.  Author says this was answered in a previous review but I can't find that review our answer here.  Should be in the app or on the website. (Even if that answer was consult a certified EEG specialist),2,4,2.0.7,2017-07-13 17:46:40,"The Muse generates a vast amount of data.
