So for names for the dog's I always have to do random ones and I can't ever name my save files anything. I also think you should add more dog breeds, because these start to get boring after a while, like more terriers for example. When you breed two different breeds, you should have a mix of them come out. Let's say you breeded  (or bred who knowsüòÇ) a German shepherd and a gray Husky.
