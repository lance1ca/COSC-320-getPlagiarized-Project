However, the game pretty much lacks in UI/UX terms. The biggest UX problem is moving around (especially down) in combat and even outside, as skills eat up the lower part of HORIZONTAL screen. Virtual joystick on the bottom left and skills on the bottom right would probably be so much better. Then, selling things is just uncomfortable. Then, character screen could be more mobile-friendly.

I'd play this game over a lot of console and PC games. With that being said the RPG elements and length of the game are criminally shallow and short for how great of a game it is. I at least wish it was being updated and supported with new content and fixes, but hopefully there is a true sequel because it has so much more potential.",5,3,,2019-09-14 07:19:20,,

The cross hatched character icons seem out of place compared to the characters.  - The game has crashed on me a few times, which leads to lost progress in dungeon sessions. The penalty of dying was not obvious, because it seems only to affect gold and not experience..? - I wish this game had a quest book.. a simple one, to help keep track of side quests; I jump back into this game and it feels like I'm just hacking and slashing while pretending to know what I'm supposed to be doing.

It's an open world to go where you want when you want.  It has loads of classes, many are secret classes that you need to find or quest for.  It has gender selection and the female characters have real armor instead of skimpy bikini outfits.  There are a lot of decisions to be made while playing that have very different effects based on your choices, so you actually affect the way things go in the world based on what you pick.  You can change areas based on what you decide to do.  You get the full game with no sneaky IAP or cheesy tricks.  The one thing I'm bummed about is that there seems to be a big portion of the game with no quests or decisions in the middle where you just run around killing to level.  This is especially a downer because of how cool and open the quests and choices in game are so you really desire more.  There also seem to be unfinished quest lines, such as when siding with the Cartel, but maybe I just am not high enough level or I broke something with some of the things I did in the order I did them, I don't quite know yet.  Overall this is one of the best RPGs I've played on Android.",5,1,1.2.3,2014-11-03 15:11:04,,
