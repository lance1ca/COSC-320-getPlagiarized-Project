The movement mechanics is also frustrating when you're trying to do platform based actions/puzzles as it's really difficult to jump accurately. Climbing and getting off ladders is also annoying. It can also be difficult to know where to go at times. A waypoint compass would make it more fluid to play.  The pros:  Incredible enemy AI. There's none of the nonsense we get now-a-days where you grind down an enemy, hide to regenerate health, then go back to finish them off. Try this in HL2 and you'll be dead within seconds. 'Normal' on HL2 is like 'hardcore' or even 'extreme' on some modern day FPSs. If you want a challenge then this is the game for you.  Then there's the gravity gun. This is possibly one of the best creations for any game. What an idea.   Apart from the movement issue I mentioned in cons, the controls are amazingly smooth compared to other Android FPSs. There's no dead region on the analogue sticks at all.   Devs, please include a quick save button in the next update!  In all, this is an amazing port. Get it. Now.",5,0,23,2014-05-19 22:58:34,,
