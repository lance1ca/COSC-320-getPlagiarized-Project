For those who like ambient minimal music & art, wind-chimes, Eno, Satie, Cage & Malevich. For relaxation & contemplation & quiet work. A culmination of Eno's work, who has always aimed to create a fusion of music & painting. It raises questions about the nature of music & authorship. Excellent quality of sound & visuals. Given the great artistic merit & work, the price is very good. By tapping the canvas one adds audio-visual elements but has no control over their nature & behavior. A ''ghost Eno'' algo takes over, loops them & carries out various permutations, in stereo. One cannot remove elements, but older ones recede when adding new ones. If satisfied with a painting, one can sit back and it continues by itself indefinitely, gradually slowing. Due to inherent randomness one cannot exactly recreate earlier sessions, but the basic elements & mood of a world are constant.  Should be further developed, e.g. with speed control. 3D visuals?  Should be able to run in the background: A tablet or phone is not a large TV screen & battery power is a concern.",5,5,1.0,2019-07-25 09:30:59,,

This app won't help. It's an algorithmic composer where you tap the screen and it plays notes and makes lava lamp-like images. These all repeat and are warped on every repeat. The tempo is slow and unadjustable and any idea you might have will be warped unrecognizeably within a few repeats. This is the kind of app you play with for 10 minutes and never touch again. Unfortunate.,2,1,1.0,2018-12-07 08:07:46,"Hello Rich, sorry if the app isn't what you were expecting, but we've not marketed Bloom: 10 Worlds as a composition tool or an instrument. It's intended to create an immersive and engaging ambient experience. I'd dispute your final claim though ; we regularly hear from people who are still using the original Bloom ten years on!",2018-12-07 08:18:22

He has given us this tool which provides the ability to create unlimited atmospheres and simply delicious sonic wallpapers...this is "" Music for Airports"" on steroids...and the best part is YOU are the engineer. This will be the best Christmas present I've given myself in many years. Thank you Mr. Eno and friends!",5,10,1.0,2018-12-07 05:10:19,,
