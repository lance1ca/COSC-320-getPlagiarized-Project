Thanks for your suggestion.

With Android 10 it shows pop-up alarms when the phone is used and the app closed. We will consider adding an option to make it show pop-up alarms instead of full screen on Android 10 and newer. For running apps on pop-up or shortcut form,  that's not possible as we don't have control over apps.

Sorry to hear that you had a bad experience. If you send us an email we will gladly explain to you how the app works and help you solve your issue.

This is a change imposed on Android10 where apps can't show in full screen when they aren't open and the screen is On. That's why we had to play the sound in the pop-up notification. So to have a full screen alarm, you need to keep the app open or turn the screen off.

Thanks for your support and feedback üëç

For timers, we need to show a notification to prevent the system from killing them. If you just need a sound at the end of the timer you can disable both alarm and notification options and Enable ""Read timers at the end"" in timers default profile under settings screen.

Sorry for that. The goal is to improve the app for unsatisfied users and to get some support from happy users by rating the app. With 4 stars you have the option to send feedback or rate. We just let you know that 4 stars rating is not supportive as it will lower global rating of the app. We hope that you understand it.

Thanks for your review.

Alarms don't depend on phone state by default so they will work even when it is set on silent or vibrate modes. You can change that behavior in the part called ""Alarm Mode"" while editing alarms. 

P.S: You need to give the app DND permission to make it work on silent mode.

Thanks for your purchase :)

Once you select a radio app for wake-up it will run after each alarm. If you want to use default settings while adding an alarm,  you need to activate the Default profile. To do it check the option ""use default profile...""

Thanks for your interesting feedback. 

For the timers, it is planned to add a default profile in the future just like the one available for alarms, tasks and contacts. 

For manually stopping the notification, do you mean to press the X icon in it? that was made to dismiss the timer, if you pause it you'll keep the info.

Unfortunately, there is nothing that we can do as your default time selector depends on your system . If it doesn't show the Analog (circular) selector, it means that it's not available.

Notice that you don't have to scroll all the way. if you press on the numbers a keyboard will show so that you can type the numbers quickly.

Sorry for the inconvenience. the update was fixing a bug in alarms with dates. Your issue must be coming from something in kind of battery saver blocking the alarms. 

Edit: With Android 6.0, you need to give the app permissions manually in device settings.

I am worried about this bug! 2. The timer (or nap alarm) is missing the increasing alarm feature. 3. UI and usability are ok, but can be improved. Fix the first item and get 5 stars from me.",4,0,3.5.2,2015-10-31 23:47:54,"Hi Zeno,

Thanks for your feedback and sorry for the incovenience. 

1- is related to another app preventing alarms from waking up your device (battery savers, task killers). Please make sure that there is no app in that kind than can prevent alarms from working.

2- you can use alarms for naps, by click on ""At"" it will change to ""In"".
