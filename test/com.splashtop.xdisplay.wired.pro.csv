However, the latency and CPU usage means it's nowhere near as smooth and seamless as simply using a second monitor. Even with the frame rate set to high it is nowhere near 60Hz and there is noticeable input lag: fine if it were wireless but surprising for a wired connection. Also, when you're done and want to close the app, it does its very best to stay open, even if you close the app from the multitask drawer - you need to open up the app settings and force close it manually.
