(Seriously, I have 
to *pay* to play as the only available female character? Oh, and all of 
them are white.) Graphics are decent and gameplay is fun. At first I 
thought the AI was cheating on easy mode as others have said by hitting the 
middle of a ship and then either side of the hit until the ship has sunk, 
but then I realized that's a strategy I used to beat my kid sister when we 
played the game in elementary school. Still, Marmalade should fix it the AI 
so it doesn't act so predictably. Medals and goals give the game some nice 
replay value. Combat mode has new ships and play strategies for an 
interesting twist. Controlling placement of the ships is quirky - I keep 
dropping them outside the grid accidentally. Also, the huge ""YOUR TURN"" 
banner that flashes across the screen is tr√® obnoxious, especially given 
that the game usually takes me 30+ turns to complete. As others have said, 
there are currently few extras: two additional non-animated backgrounds for 
99¬¢ each; two additional characters - including the only female in the game 
- at $1.99 per. My hope is that if this game takes off like Marmalade's 
excellent Clue, more characters (including more diversity), more 
backgrounds, and maybe even more extras will be available. Oh, and that the 
""YOUR TURN"" banner will drown in the Baltic Sea. (Edited for grammar and to 
add more info.)",4,2,0.0.13,2018-06-03 01:04:14,,

it ignores your picks for targets. As in you pick a spot and it ignores 
your input until you select ba miss square then proceeds. Sadly I paid for 
this game. Truly wish 5here was a buyer's remorse ability and if after 
playing for 15 to 30 min you can refund your purchase",1,7,0.0.11,2018-05-05 21:30:25,,

standard, especially from my favorite interpreters of Hasbro's catalog. 
Classic gameplay is smooth & straightforward, but as a whole the app still 
feels like a work in progress. Taps on the commander selection screen don't 
always register. There's no option for signing in with Facebook, so we're 
all saddled with bizarre random player IDs for now. A dedicated shop for 
IAPs would be nice, as well as some kind of rules screens or tutorial for 
navigating the new features of the mobile game. Much like the developer's 
Clue and Life apps, I'm sure Battleship will become more refined with each 
update.",3,4,0.0.11,2018-05-04 22:03:14,,
