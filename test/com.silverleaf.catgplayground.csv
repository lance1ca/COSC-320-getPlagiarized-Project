My attack cat loved the mouse game, tried to get under the tablet and eat the mouse several times. However he can close the app easily or change screens then send blank emails or reply to emails and txts...  He liked the whack a mouse game too but the contrast on the screen seemed off to me the killer cat did try to dig under the tablet screen and case to get to the mice.   My laser pointer cat didn't catch onto the laser game but the non laser pointer cat did watch for a bit.   The fish level got a couple of swipes and bites on the screen (he's caught actual fish in a tank that way) but then a shrug and no more action.
