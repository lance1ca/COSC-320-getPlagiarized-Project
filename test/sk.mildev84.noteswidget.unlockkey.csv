Please add the delete checkbox on each note.  --- Update I received an email from the developer and the reason for the removal of the checkbox was that it makes it easier to accidentally delete messages and also will look into adding it in the options.   Sorry for the poor rating earlier but do to the prompt and personal response I now give it 5!
