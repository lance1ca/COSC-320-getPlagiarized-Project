Words with silent eâ€™s (vowel-consonant-e words) â€“ youâ€™re covered.  In just a few taps your child is ready to practice the rules sheâ€™s just learned! There are also a generous number of words included â€“ 320 in total!  I also like the options â€“ different keyboard layouts, lower case/upper case, cursive, and optional hints.  They go along with the phonics flexibility to offer a great learning tool with excellent value.
