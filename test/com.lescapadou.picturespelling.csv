Not only are they ‘smart’ in that the letter sounds change according to the word being built, but as a parent you can hone in so carefully on the phonograms that your child is learning – need words including ‘ck’ – no problem!  Words with silent e’s (vowel-consonant-e words) – you’re covered.  In just a few taps your child is ready to practice the rules she’s just learned! There are also a generous number of words included – 320 in total!  I also like the options – different keyboard layouts, lower case/upper case, cursive, and optional hints.  They go along with the phonics flexibility to offer a great learning tool with excellent value.  The phonics-based movable alphabet is a nice bonus that you can use like talking letter magnets for simple (short letter sounds) reading and spelling lessons – or just for fun!",5,5,1.0,2012-03-29 18:49:36,,
