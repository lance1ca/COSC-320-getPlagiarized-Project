Please accept our apologies for the rotation bug, it has to do with how the OS communicates orientation to the app, which on rare occasions doesn't work properly. If you swipe to the camera roll immediately after taking a photo, it may take a second or two for the image to appear.

Thank you for your feedback. ProShot was written using Google's camera2 API, which is what allows the app to safely access manual settings and RAW. Unfortunately, the OnePlus One doesn't have full camera2 API support, so it is not possible to add RAW at this time.

I'm sad to report, Google removed exposure compensation from the 5X. They did the same thing last year with the 6, citing difficulties with the exposure algorithm. It's really unfortunate that they couldn't get it to work :/

Have you tried changing the noise reduction settings? The default is off, which results in sharper images, but not all people may like that. Try changing it to NR HQ and see if that helps.

Also, what do you feel is missing form the UI? Please email me at support@riseupgames.com

Installed it now on my OnePlus One, and it's very lacking, apparently due to the OPO missing Camera2 API (not a lot of info provided on that one...). While I have manual control of most features (WB, ISO, manual focus and exposure) in other apps, I can't change much in ProShot. Hope this is fixable, as right now it's pretty point-and-click, which is disappointing.  Note: I'm running a CyanogenMod 12.1 nightly from about a week ago, so it should be pretty up to date.  EDIT: Read up on Camera2 API support on OnePlus One and CyanogenMod. I see it's something they need to support, so that's ok. But I still can't figure out why other apps allow me to change these settings and ProShot does not.",4,0,1.0.3,2015-07-06 11:32:17,"Hello, so glad to see a fan from WP! At the moment, I can't seem to find any apps that support the features you're talking about on the OPO. Please contact me: support@riseupgames.com. If it's possible to add these features, I definitely will!",2015-07-06 15:50:17
