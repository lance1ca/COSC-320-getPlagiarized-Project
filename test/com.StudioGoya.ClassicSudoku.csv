It's the only one that allows both corner and center notes for advanced marking. The puzzles it comes with are all hand created which means there are some methods needed to solve them you'd never see in the usual symmetrical computer generated ones. This also means there hints that pertain specifically to the puzzle you're working on. I've only done the first one so far and want to go back and try it again since I'm pretty sure there were some obvious things I missed that would have sped things up. I do wish one could enter puzzles manually as there are some really good ones out there. Perhaps this will be considered for a future update. With 5 new ones a month though, I suspect I'll have plenty to keep me busy for a good while. Finally, this app does allow itself to be moved to an SD card so kudos for that.",5,7,1.01,2019-11-27 16:04:11,,
