I really enjoy this game, played through in one day. The setting is just gorgeous! I loved the humor in it, it was a teeny bit kitschy at times but that made it charming to me. There's a ""kid"" mode which was thoughtful. There's a kind of in-game hint system and I could always go back to revisit something if I missed a detail which wasn't necessary but made the game stress-free.
