It cannot even register my highest or lowest notes on my instrument. And to get it to hear the other notes I have to switch the instrument the tuner is set to. The guitar could tune the middle notes, the bass could tune the low notes, and the violin could tune the high notes. It is very cumbersome and annoying to have to switch between settings to be able to tune my instrument.
