So outside of making some money via ticket revenue and the occasional prize money there isn't much money to be made.,2,22,1.5.2,2020-12-26 12:11:44,"Thanks for your feedback. Regarding the value of academy players - as soon as they start to play more games and gain more experience, their value will increase rapidly.

Maybe 2 only annoying things about the game is that you tend to lose a lot away games. Even if it's a neutral ground game but your team is in the away spot I'm never confident my team is going to win. 2nd is the manager during transfer window always wants to sign a player that he doesn't need he's never satisfied with the squad even if your squad is good with a lot if brilliant players. Other than that. Brilliant game 👍,4,12,1.4.1,2020-03-29 13:15:53,,

However, even the best managers in the game do not rotate their squad properly (contrary to UC response below) and you can end up playing your most important match with a weak starting XI.

I'm currently on my 150th season with a Spanish team and I have only just won my first La Liga title. This game is extremely difficult but with a little patience and perserverence you can get to the very top.

1, Complete all 50 achievements (if you haven't already!)
2, Take over a non-league club and bankroll them to the top
3, Try one of the four challenge scenarios
4, Find a new datapack with leagues from a different country
5, Or create your own datapack with our free online editor.

Hope that helps!",2019-01-03 03:05:06

version and as my 30 years was almost up I decided to pay, never done that 
before so that's great. However I'm noticing that the manager always 
attempts to make these huge signings and on the occasion that I do sign the 
player he will leave him on the bench after a few games and will play 
someone with a lower rating. I tried to rationalize this whole thing, but 
after seeing it happen so often I'm convinced that something is not right.

can pick up from where you left off very quickly. I would suggest a couple 
of slight tweaks would be worth thinking about though. 1. Manager 
contracts, managers should be given a set contract instead just a rolling 
12m contract. 2. The 1 transfer a week option during the transfer window 
seems a bit harsh. I feel there should be an option to use the employed 
scouts to find extra players, like u21, certain rating + etc and offer you 
more opportunities to try and sign players, not everyone who's scouted 
needs to be available or they could not want to leave but it just gives you 
more chances to improve the squad. 3. The use of agents to help sell your 
players that are transfer listed or you want rid of to bring your squad 
size down. So your not just stuck with 1 per week. The offer might be good 
it might be bad but at least with agents you would get more offers.",5,18,1.4.1,2018-05-29 00:36:08,,

I loved it  however I would like to see a bit more ipn regards to chairman activity like having the ability to choose sponsorship on stadium boards to create more revenue and have more in depth financial stats and the ability to be able to negotiate wages more and pay rises rather than except what is given. In regards to price I think.£2 should be enough and the super stadium is over priced at £3.99 the price of a new game but overall its a good game but could do with more to do as a chairman to give it more scope .  One thing that bugs me is I get more £0 bids for players than real bids or loan bids it actually ruins the game I've played got my team up to premier league and the whole time the £0 bids for players is about 80% of the time. You should have a negotiate button as well so you can negotiate a price when such bids come in with a cap so you cant ask over a certain price.,3,2,1.3.1,2017-11-15 08:20:01,Please feel free to contact us via the contact form at http://www.football-chairman.com/#contact because we'd love to discuss your feedback in more depth.

It is possible to do well without spending any more on in-app purchases, you just have to be patient and invest in your club's infrastrcture. The simple controls are, well, simple, and the speed with which the game play passes, can get you through a season (if you take some considered time to interact with the game) in about twenty to thirty minutes. Although, I've lost a few hours just playing the game, it's very fun and addictive. Given the number of football manager and chairman games nowadays that seem to be so in depth and somewhat complicated by excessive attributes (skill, positioning, concentration et cetera), more straightforward games like this would be appreciated.

Have a way to encourage the manager to play specific players who aren't getting game time so that you don't lose them on contract expiry.  2. Be able to set out your expectations of a manager at the beginning of a season or when a new one comes in. This could be as simple as choosing from a list ""aim for playoffs"" ""win a domestic cup"" ect.  3. Be able to change the ticket prices mid season. This adds more flexibility as to how you manage your finances and could be utilised to avoid bankruptcy.  4. Ways to invest money over seasons (up to 10).

But all these things you can deal with, one more thing that would be nice is if you get some interest from your money I know the developers need to earn a crust from the game (ingame purchases) it would also be nice if the transfer market wasn't as skewed toward the team trying to buy your player, and maybe an ability to buy players you have had on loan.

They could learn a lot by going back and looking at Ultimate Soccer Manager.

Also you play some amateur teams in friendlies and cup ties so why not make your club start in the amateur league, this would make it even more of a challenge and again that's even more exciting.

They should perhaps be tine to time Chairman to manager chats like telling the manager what he expects from the manager e.g. emphasis on younger players or experience or rotation etc. I have had my manager come to me asking to buy a whole lot of players who are mediocre and old despite me giving him a lot of money to buy the 'world', or leaving good players on the bench the entire season and then they want to leave.  One area I find funny, is that my manager would buy a player and then let him go a couple of weeks later...I have had that happen a few times.

I went ahead and purchased the full version and have not regretted it one bit. The game is perfect for my commute to work, and being able to create my own league is deeply appreciated. The only knocks I have on the game are: (1) all too often an offer is made to purchase a player of mine who I feel the need to keep. I reject the offer, only to find that my manager wants to acquire a better player at that position on a free transfer! Or I sell a player while negotiating a salary with a better player, only for him to refuse the contract and then I'm short one player. It would help to know if I will bring the new player on before selling the other player. (2) the controls along the bottom of the screen are right where I place my thumbs at rest. Sometimes this will lead to inadvertent player moves. But all of that bring said, the game is rock solid and is exactly what I want in a sports app!",5,1,1.2.2,2017-02-10 18:20:03,,

The developers did a great job regarding game play as it focuses on what matters to players. Really fun. However no club can have a balanced budget as to progress it requires spending more than the club makes. Leading to buy packages. I'll give five stars for the game play and five stars for the business case. Still sums up to two stars as I feel cheated to pay upfront for an add on game.,2,205,1.2.2,2016-08-02 17:56:31,,

But...after buying the game, to see in app purchases is a bit annoying, but OK,  they gotta earn, but if you spend your money on a super stadium on a save file, then go bankrupt later in game(being a chairman ain't easy), you restart a game, or you cheat and reload your save from whatever point you backed up.  If you restart, that beautiful stadium is gone, you have to buy again with real money. I think if you buy once, it should become an option to use that stadium on any future game files should you choose. Doesn't seem right having to buy if more than once to me, so I don't buy.  Manager contract should be able to choose rolling(as it is) or an expiry date like real life.  I've been unable to afford to sack a manager or I'd go bust, so had to watch that idiot relegate my beloved club and sack him in the summer spending all my next year transfer budget. Should be able to just let it expire, he leaves for free.  Far to many great free transfers.  I turn down a 91 rated player for £40mill,next week he says he wants a 97 rated player on a free.
