I have access to all of my music on my external card now is it really playing in either 432 or 528hz i can not say but the sound for some reason i like more than on other music players. That should say something. Thank you.,4,0,18.4,2018-03-02 11:58:55,,

I would rate higher if it had a genre category and if it would stop freezing up. I love the concept of 432Hz though. I can tell the difference.,3,0,16.9,2017-07-03 07:03:13,"Hey Arturo,

Thank you for the feedback!
What do you mean by ""Freezing Up""? does the player stutter or stops working?
Can you try adjusting the buffer on the menu? and see if it helps? (it should)

BTW,
Are you sure that the free version works better on your device?
Can you try disabling the Equalizer and see it helps to performance? (only on Pro)",2017-07-05 06:41:53

I have noticed my music has a more full sound. Though I'm having a slight problem with my music cutting out several times each song. Its only for a fraction of a second but cuts out none the less.          Reply,               I had the buffer down at around 6000. I saw a few reviews about buffering so I moved it up to around 14000 and it still cuts out a few times every song.

It is a high spec phone and it works perfectly. I did a 45 minutes meditation listening to  a tracks via AIMP player and not one problem. Next day when I try with 432player after 4 tracks about 10minutes the tracks began to stutter and freeze and I have to keep pushing play it would play for one  a second and freeze again. I keep pushing play and my phone rebooted. Same behaviour as before when on the plane mode.  I love 432 hz music and it is the best thing but if the 432player doesn't play there is not much I can do. I noticed your app have the most problems with long tracks e ample 30 min tracks or 40 minutes long meditation tracks etc. Maybe just doesn't like my phone. Oh well I will just have to put up with AIMP PLAYER at 440hz.  Ok.reinstalled it. After 4 songs tracks it it began to refuse to play my  tracks and my phone rebooted.  I can play tracks for hours with aimp and i dont have any issues. Sorry for now I cannot listen to music in this fashion and have uninstalled your player. Ver15.9.  I have now uninstalled this app even though I have paid for it. It made my phone unstable. Htc10. Rebooting and crashing. The menu was slow. What killed it for me was when I went I to flight mode on an airplane my phone went Berzerk. I got the computer geek at my work to check it and he told this app is communicating with internet constantly draining power. When I went to flight mode the app no longer get could contact internet and thus went crazy.   This app has gone worse. I can't play more than  a ten to fifteen tracks without  a my phone rebooting.  Aimp does not have tgis problem. Reading files mode takes forever. I just pray now that aimp make 432hz feature,2,0,15.9,2017-05-31 14:11:46,"The 432 Player has no need for internet, except for two things - radio (only when it's playing) and album art auto find (which is by default turned off)
Your phone might be defected, as the 432 Player don't have any effect on Airplane Mode WHATSOEVER.
I hope you'll find peace and you are welcome to uninstall the player at any time.

The player plays all your music in a row, with or without shuffle when the app is closed and you start playing from the widget.
But if you play from the actual player and leave it to be in the background you can play per folder, per album, artist‚Äã, etc...üôè",2017-05-21 22:42:41
