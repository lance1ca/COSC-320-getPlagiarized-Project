Well worth the $2. Been playing for a week now and I love the classic style of turn based rpgs. Skill trees are awesome and the static skill system is great. There is many possibilities to make your character its easy to reset all stats if you don't like your current build. Gear upgrades are awesome some are base and others have prefixes and suffixes. It reminds me of a mixture of diablo 1 and one of the final fantasy for Gameboy. I would definitely suggest this game!,5,3,1.1.3,2021-01-07 18:17:49,,

You can choose their moves and attacks during battle, change their equipment, and select which abilities and spells they learn and improve as they level up.

However, I quickly realized how insanely repetitive the quests and combat are in this game. If you buy AlterKnight, you'll maybe enjoy it for two hours. Two hours of fun for $2.00 isnt a bad price, though.",2,1,1.0.6,2020-09-27 20:38:53,"Thank you for your review! We apologize that you did not enjoy the game. We are continuing to improve AlterKnight with new features and additional content throughout the Beta. We recently released a large update that provides full control over NPC allies, makes combat more challenging, and speeds up the pace of the game. We hope you will enjoy it!",2020-12-19 02:21:39

Leveling up your character's Agility will also increase how fast they move, and you can double-tap the screen to sprint for a further burst of speed!

The mini crafting game is fun, I like running around looking for flowers. It's definitely challenging at times but there are a lot of different ways to build your character, so I recommend experimenting with skill tree combos!",5,8,1.0.6,2020-09-19 17:54:08,Thank you for your purchase and review!
