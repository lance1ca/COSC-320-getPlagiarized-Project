The game is better suited to a larger screen than a smaller one; I have a 6.5"" screen but I can't imagine playing on anything smaller than 5.5"". The controls are pretty straight forward, tap once or twice and the thing gets built. I have to agree with the other reviews that state the tutorial is very much lacking in content. While it does help with the learning of the tap and tap aspect of the game, it very much lacks in terms of what each building does. The in-game tool-tips are not very helpful either in some cases and, again, going back to the screen size, the font is very small and I can imagine would be very tiny on a smaller screen. All that to say, I have over 10 hours into this game so far and I believe I have had it less than a week. It is a 2D version of Factorio without the drama of biters or the weaponry that goes along with them. There's also no power requirements (as of this writing) for any of the buildings so that really helps, too. If you have played Factorio with the Factorissimo mod, it kind of reminds me of that; a factory inside a factory. Again, great game for only $1! Also, no ads!

Truly one of the best mobile games out there. And for only $1? Just buy it. The best comparison here is to production line games like Factorio and Mindustry. Factorio is about optimizing layout and factory efficiency on a (very) large scale. Mindustry is a tower defense game which emphasizes production speed and utilizing the terrain effectively. Both of those features (large scale and speed) are difficult to fully experience on a small mobile screen. The Quarry is much better on mobile. It's more a pure production line game. It's a puzzle, not an optimization game or a tower defense game. And it is terribly fun. The tech tree here is very deep, and I really like how the tutorial gives you just enough to get started and you get to figure out how everything works for yourself.
