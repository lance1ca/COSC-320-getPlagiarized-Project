Just add some good music with a player app and you're ready to skip! What I'd love to see in the pro version though would be to be able to create our own routines in the timer/tabata part of the app, just having a timer is good but adding the existing exercices the way we want it would add so much to the app. It would be super duper cool!",4,6,2.3,2020-11-01 23:03:48,,

This app has a great potential and in order to give it 5 stars in future I would suggest adding the possibility creating custom workout from available list of exercises and arranging workouts in a weekly/monthly plans or challenges. Also during the workout 1 min rest period always comes after & is followed by extra 10s rest rest that is a bit annoying.,4,9,2.3,2020-07-05 02:20:50,,
