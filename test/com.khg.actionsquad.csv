Disappointed that it's only single player. The controls feel offish compared to pc and sometimes(often) the gunshot animation happens before the sound. also I struggle meleeing enemies who are close to doors as it just makes me enter the doorway. Otherwise lots of fun so far. Just maybe give me a zoom option on my character. It's annoying barely being able to see him.,3,10,1.0.32,2020-04-08 06:35:19,,
