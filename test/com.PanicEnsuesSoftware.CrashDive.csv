Torpedoes consistently miss their targets, (even the 1st target of the mission) on easy level. Enemy ships function and spin in an unrealistic manner in order to miss being hit... Please!

Easy. Several times I have started on a new Patrol only to run into five or 
six escorts my first time out of the base. Easy should be easy, meaning 
either the convoys have no escorts or very lightly escorted one maybe two 
so you can get the real feel of the game. Torpedoes should be straight and 
true with very few malfunctions if any. In the easy mode , the Torpedoes 
should always hit their mark so many times you are shooting a torpedo dead 
at another vessel only for it to miss. The earlier versions did not seem to 
have this anomaly in the easy mode. Remember, this is the easy mode. Leave 
the more challenging modes for the moderate or Advanced groups. Thanks for 
a great game... Oh and would you separate the torpedo and deck gun buttons

Only luck factor you can escape. when you escape, the target already far away.  Or your sub get damage from deep charge or get ram by enemy ship when no deep charge or ship near you.

Are the enemy ships disappearing from the Chart view or periscope view?
Torpedoes rise to the surface pretty quickly, so a torp fired from 10m away shouldn't pass under a ship unless it's right on top of you... in which case it wouldn't detonate anyways (torps only arm once 250m away).

First off when playing campaign you have to start on easy...which is extremely arcade-ish...and ladder up to unlock harder difficulties.  Once you hit the difficulty and make custom changes, that's when the game really shines.  As another reviewer wrote, the controls are very intuitive, but you will learn 1 or 2 things if you find an online guide / tips.  I am extremely impressed of how well this app is put together.    Pros:  Very easy to learn Very easy to get into a battle if just playing for 10-15 minutes.   So nostalgic to older great games.   Great visuals, immersive sound, good touch screen options, good tactics.   To anyone that complains about the cost of the app...it's cheaper than a movie ticket and I can see putting 100 hours into this sucker.   Cracking your 1st battleship or aircraft carrier and getting away on harder difficulties is nerve racking and awesome!!   Cons (all rather minor):  Ships passing through each other is kinda cheesy.   AI seems to always know where you are (I'll give that one to ya).   Small complaint...more variety of ships / classes.   Torpedo arc...thought they had gyros?",5,0,1.5.25,2015-09-17 15:46:37,,

Also, a Destroyer running at 18 knots making a hard-over turn would throw the crew around like rag dolls. I do like the new patrol using resupply to determine length, works great. A career mode would be great, possibly bringing in crew development and different sub types as well. And why do the Germans get all the fun?!

If you ever played Aces, or if you read about the simple fun of the early subsims, how can you pass on Crash Dive? This is an excellent game that offers engaging U-boat gameplay built on a visually appealing base with solid AI and first-rate controls.   The game interface is clustered with finely detailed controls to manage your U-boat. During a battle there are three main screens: the navigation chart, periscope view, and bridge view. While on the bridge you can use binoculars/UZO to target ships. The controls are well thought-out. Changing depth is done in 50m increments, you can shift the boat to view with a click, er... touch. Torpedoes can be fired individually or in a spread of three. When your U-boat takes damage, small report banners pop up.  Since the wave of mobile and iPad platform games, I've played more than a few naval titles, some of them quite good. Panic Ensues has crafted a game that satisfies the yearning for a good subsim and reestablishes the allure of North Atlantic convoy combat in a way that does Aces of the Deep, Silent Service, and Grey Wolf proud.",5,8,1.3.4.1,2014-09-06 07:36:16,,
