It would be really cool if you could include some sinple explanations about scheduling and optimisation in node theory so the lines can be more deliberately drawn and maybe some history of some of the train stations. A bogey mode where some lines are blown or bombed away can add some tension to the game to challenge the user to adapt. How on earth did you folks code for this??

The simple graphics combined with the great music alongside the intricate gameplay make for a both relaxing and VERY chaotic experience. The sudden major expansion of the map and steadily increasing passenger inflow keeps the game very attentive. The station spawns can be so unique that sometimes you don't even feel like you played the same map. Overall very good. Oh and the controls on mobile are MUCH better than on PC (where there aren't any at all).,5,24,2.41.0,2020-01-18 11:25:59,,

If you do have a tunnel, the tunnel will be used even though the stations are on the same side of the river!

I like that, unless you're playing in Endless mode, games can be completed in about 20 minutes. Great, simple, minimalistic interface. A couple of suggestions/requests: it would be nice to be able to save a game to come back to later. Also, sometimes there are parameters or restrictions on a particular city that you're not aware of unless you try to do something that goes against those restrictions. For instance, in one city I tried to add a fifth locomotive to a line but a message popped up saying that city cannot have more than four per line . There was no way (that I'm aware of) to have known that. It'd be nice, while you're playing a city, for there to be a button you can tap on to review the unique rules for that city.

and the controls are superficially adequate, it becomes very difficult to 
redraw or extend routes when dealing with multiple lines on a densely 
populated map. The appearance of new stations seems to be random, passenger 
numbers can escalate totally without warning, and if the RNG hasn't given 
you favourable assets then your only hope of survival is frequently to 
redraw the whole map. Which wouldn't be a problem, were it not for the 
finicky controls I mentioned earlier. Endless mode removes that constant 
tension, but paradoxically the game really suffers without it. Extreme mode 
seems to have been added purely as a facetious nod to the ZOMG HARDCOAR 
crowd. Also, the music really creeps me out (YMMV, natch). Three words?

randomness and not enough ways to curb escalation. Passengers get added 
randomly so I don't know when or where to expect them; worst of all, I 
don't know which Stations are higher priority, so I have no idea which 
locations passengers will prefer. Stations get crowded very quickly in the 
mid-game, and there is no direct way for me to help that. The upgrades, 
although I get to select two, are always randomly paired. So even though I 
need a carriage, my only options might be new lines and new tunnels. 
Therefore, the loss condition is out of my hands, like a roll of the dice. 
This game feels very strategic and simple, but I worry there are underlying 
mechanics that I can't understand or predict. If I better knew why 
passengers want to go where they want to go or, for instance, why my trains

I won't repeat what the other users are saying. Suggestions: needs an undo key. Really. Especially when playing in extreme mode. On a phone it's really easy to pick the wrong line. Also, in extreme mode, if the game adds a station in a place that requires a tunnel, you have to supply the tunnel as well, or you're mathematically dead. It spoils the fun of the game. Finally, every Sunday you should give the player the opportunity to choose a couple of items among all the possible choices (locomotive, line, tunnel, interchange, carriage) instead of two random items. This would allow the player to create its own strategy instead of hoping that she will get the interchange rather than a tunnel or whatever. After all, it's a puzzle game.

As such, when I remembered there was an Android release, and that I had some google play money leftover from the holidays, I bought it here on the play store. Regardless of device, it's a great game, and I'm more than happy with my purchases. It handles just as well on android as I'd expect, though I run into a bit of a snag. Nothing too horrible, just a curiosity I'd like to bring to light.  My daily driver is not generally my phone, it's an Acer Chromebook R-11, which was one of the first models to support android apps/games out of the box. When I'm using the device's touchscreen to play the game, it works fine, and exactly as one might expect. However, when using the touchpad/trackpad/whatever-it's-called, it will work MOSTLY fine, but it's very prone to wigging out. Doesn't break the game, though sometimes rail lines stop being drawn onscreen after it attempts to recover from said fit. I don't think this is an issue many people will run into, as I do believe Chromebooks users are still largely a niche device compared to the likes of phones and tablets, and as such I'm not too upset. I'll continue to enjoy the game on all devices, even with that little hiccup.  Thanks for bringing it to Android (and thus ChromeOS)! I have many more hours to sink into this game.

Controls are simple and easy to learn. The procedurally generated stations typically result in maps that don't resemble the real cities, but that doesn't take away from the gameplay. Overall it's an amusing way to work your brain if you have 10 minutes of free time.   The bad:  It's repetitive. There is very little variance between levels, as the only major distinguishing factors are the bodies of water and whether a car can hold 4 or 6 passengers. Unlocking new levels is relatively unchallenging, and difficulty doesn't increase in later levels. The only thing you unlock is a new map to play on, without any added challenge or benefit. I found myself getting bored before I had even unlocked all the maps. There are also a few minor usability issues with the menus (e.g., clicking a map scrolls to the next one instead of starting the level, and there's a ""show replay"" button which one would think is a ""continue"" button.) Given the option to start over, I would probably pay $0.99 for this game.
