Upon setting up integration with my existing library in OneDrive, the app successfully downloaded the covers for all 4,372 books without having to retry even once. That's a good indicator to me as my experience with a similar app ""Calibre-Go"" tends to require multiple attempts. I'm finding a need for more documentation on connecting to a Calibre Content Server. When connecting via IP address it fails. However, I found that if I add the ""/opds"" suffix to the url, the app returns ""Sign in Successful"" but it fails to display anything except for a blank white screen and a spinning blue circle. After approx 10 minutes of spinning, I'll close the app and reopen to find the library has not been added. Still deserving of 5 stars for the fact that you're actively maintaining an app where IMHO there is no competition and I must encourage others to find your app and support it hoping it encourages you to continue with your work.",5,2,1.14.1,2020-12-02 11:30:17,"Hi Christopher, thank you very much for using our app and your feedback, we've included more information about how to set up Calibre Content server in this website https://calibresync.bitbucket.io.

Devs responded to a question of mine AND CHANGED THE APP within 24 hours. It works with most Cloud services (in particular Box which I've just moved to) and has a reasonably intuitive interface. The filter options are amazing, particularly for my collection which is largely fanfic, so many thousands of 'books'. :D Filter by author, tags, publisher, any of the columns in Calibre including your own custom columns, and filter on an any/all basis. C-Sync will bring you works which meet any one of your filters, or flip a toggle and it will bring you works which meet ALL of your filters. Very useful! The search function is also great, giving search results for more than just title and author including series and publisher.
