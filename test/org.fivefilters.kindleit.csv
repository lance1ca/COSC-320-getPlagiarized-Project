The text formatting in the Kindle is clean and generally free of stray elements that interrupt the flow of the text. And becuase I also have the Kindle for Android app installed on my Nexus 5 and associated with the same Kindle device, when I PTK an item, it simultaneously arrives in both my Kindle and my Nexus. That's nice.  But each time I use the mobile PTK app, it generates an email alerting me to the fact that I have just PTK'd an item to my Kindle. This is unnecessary and annoying because it clutters up my inbox. The PTK app itself already announces success each time it sends an item to my Kindle; I don't need a redundant reminder in my inbox.

I've bought a few games, but most productivity apps can be had for free—unfortunate as that may be for the brilliant developers out there.  With the unrivaled resolution of HTC Rezound, and the perfect-book-reading size screen of my Nexus 7, I'v recently fallen in love with reading books/news, etc on my small and mid-size screens!    When it comes to reading long text on the web, the built-in browser on the Rezound (Internet app) excells resizing just the portion of the web page I want to read.  Chrome (Nexus 7), however, fails that task.    Either way, reading in a good e-reader (Kindle app, Google Books, Aldiko) is a MUCH nicer experience!  Now, whenever I'm working and I come across a LONG article that I don't have the stamina to read sitting up at my workstation, I simply send it to Kindle, wait a minute or two (just enough time to go get comfy on the couch) and start reading in leisure.
