I'll review and give strategy at the end. The good: -Depending on the year, states have pre-set starting points and momentum, which makes each year feel distinctive. -Multiple ways to spend money to create a strategy, at least on lower difficulties. -Adding to this, most states have different costs associated with their campaigns. -Pseudo-random money bubbles and random events that boost/hinder support nationally/state-wide add to replayability. -Each game takes around 20 minutes and auto-saves, so it's easy to pick up and put down, or complete in a sitting. The bad: -There are a few bugs. When responding to a politician random event, it replaces the second name with Trump. When responding to a state random event, it changes the second state in the text. The worst though is that if you're in the middle of a campaign and restart your game, the campaign keeps going. You still get the benefit when it finishes for no cost. -Candidates are all the same. Nothing sets them apart. Not that it really could, because other than ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" (which you have to guess on, since it's not listed on the state, and would be helpful for radio vs. Internet ads), states aren't special like in 270. -Campaign upgrades are mostly useless except for Fund Raisers. And even then, level 1 is the best. Every level after that is not only more expensive (2M to 8M), but gives diminishing returns (10% down to 6% per level). -Hard Mode is mindlessly easy, with the exceptions being 1992 Bush and 1996 Dole, which are MUCH more difficult. -Every state starts with 3 ""priorities"" they care about. They are completely random each game, which adds to the replayability, but not as much as you'd think. Matching a campaign to a priority gives a small bump, but for the most part it's better to ignore campaigns in favor of volunteers. -Along the same lines, if campaigns mattered more, that'd mean you'd need to restart until you got a good match for key states. -I haven't noticed your candidate's campaign-wide issue to do anything. Whether it matches a state priority or not hasn't made a difference, either passively or for a campaign. -Their online manual says that low-risk means succeeding 75% of the time for a small benefit, and high-risk means succeeding 25% of the time for a large benefit. Unless it's very early in the game and you don't mind restarting if you fail a high-risk, it's better to just pick low-risk and get consistent small bumps rather than tank your approval. Volunteer vs Campaign info: Volunteers work the entire game. Hire them until maybe 30 days from the end of the game. They're a small but consistent benefit. States it's better to use campaigns, from best to meh: DC, WY, AK, ND, VT, DE, SD, RI, HI, ID, ME, MT, NH, NE, NM, WV, MS, NV, UT, CT, OK, IA, AR, KS, OR, SC, MN, and WI. The problem is that for most games, with the exception of ME, NH, NM, NV, and IA, those states aren't flipping unless you repeatedly bombard them with campaigns. And at best, you're getting 8 electoral votes for a ton of money (and time doing it repeatedly). Focus on a mix of volunteers and campaigns for the latter ones. Strategy: In general, Volunteers are your best option. Spread them out evenly. Ground Campaigns are great when there are 7% undecideds or more. Start every game with leveling up Fund Raisers once, and ignore the others. If any state's brown or lightly colored, flood it with campaigns 5 days before the game ends. For Democrats, put 13k volunteers on TX, 11k on FL, and 6k on PA. Campaign in ME if it's turning. Done! For Republicans, put 13k volunteers on CA, 10k on FL, and 7k on OH. Campaign in IN if it's turning. Done! Except for... 1992 Bush - put 10k on CA, 9k on IL, 9k on FL, 7k on MI, 7k on TX, 2k on WI, 2k on TN, and 1k on ME. Campaign in WI, TN, ME, and LA. 1996 Dole - put 9k on CA, 5k on MI, 4k on VA, 4k on NC, 4k on MN, 4k on TX, 4k on MO, 4k on IA, 2k on MS, 2k on OH, 2k on IN, and 1k on WI.

Can't wait for the extension to this game. Star deducted for the odd random state priorities - I'd prefer them to be consistent and to make sense by state. Maybe even favour certain candidates on some issues by state - eg immigration could help Obama in majority-minority NM but hurt him in OH/PA.",4,1,1.0,2012-10-29 10:57:19,,
