I must have tried 40-50 finance apps and NOT one of them could get the reconcile function to work the way I like it to work. I know I am in the minority (at least according to my wife) as I still reconcile my monthly bank statement with my electronic finance manager. EVERY app I tried, both free and paid, would not show me a ""cleared balance"" which is what I use to ensure that my account is accurate. This program is very similar to the ""Accounts"" program I used on my IOS devices and it is working great!",5,1,1.1.24,2020-11-08 11:14:30,,
