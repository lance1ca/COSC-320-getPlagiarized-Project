the problems. 1) Reconnection is a pain. sometimes work, sometimes doesnt. 
Have to manually reconnect a few time for it to work. 2) When finally 
connected, it can stop any time. The navigation just freezes whenever it 
feels like. Totally useless. 3) The audio/music function also not 
seamless... have to manually play on the phone for music to start when 
startup. it doesnt connect and just play. But in fairness, that could be 
the player app that i use... however, the same phone works just fine with 
my cars (emphasis plural). so, more blame on KTM.",1,4,2.1.2.329-release,2018-07-31 18:23:03,,

great testing for some runs. Yesterday when I actually needed it for a 200 
mile journey, even though Bluetooth was connected to the bike enough for a 
phonecall to come through, the app just would not recognise there being a 
bike connected! I tried turning things of and on, repairing them, clearing 
all the app data, nothing worked. Very frustrating having to stop a few
