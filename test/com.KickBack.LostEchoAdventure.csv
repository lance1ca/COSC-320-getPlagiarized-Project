How can I trust this database to guide my choices if I cannot filter reviews? If you're considering this game might be good because of its 4+ rating, take my word for it: the rating system is BS.  Puzzle design is the core of any adventure game, so I was startled by the game's offer of a puzzle difficulty setting. This suggests the designers felt they could design their puzzles as modules they could slot in or out with this difficulty setting. Puzzling is the central experience of the game, but what happens to my immersion if some game details are constant ""story"" features and others are ""puzzle"" features?  I came to one puzzle where I learned I needed to knock on a door with a correct pattern to proceed. A previous puzzle had already provided a graphic, a pattern of colored dots, which I would have to interpret. To be honest, I still don't see much to puzzle out from this, yet I found the experience of solving this puzzle to the computer's satisfaction quite frustrating. I had one character I could ask for advice, though he had very little to offer, and I checked the game's online help which presented the same solution I'd had in mind several minutes earlier. Eventually through repetition I entered the precise timing of knocks the software needed, and my story progressed.  Regarding that pattern of colored dots, I didn't even need to solve that puzzle. Not that I didn't try, but I just couldn't make any sense of what the puzzle wanted me to do. The game's text hinted to me that it was an ""equation"" which is next to meaningless.  As any student of math should understand, an equation is an expression made in a formal system of symbols representing truth. We study equations to apply the system's rules for transforming the expression into new forms. But in this puzzle, that could only be called ""equation-ish"", the rules of the system were a mystery with zero feedback from the software. Just a jumbled mess tossed in my lap, along with jokes about my inferior intelligence.  Seriously!  Just to bring home how little confidence the game's designers had in that last puzzle, your apartment's AI offers you a choice to not solve it in favor of it presenting the solution for you.  Anyway, this is my long-winded explanation for ""I'm done, I'm gone"". Thanks for the lesson in harsh reality, I guess? Now I will find something rewarding or meaningful to do with my time.",1,2,1.9.13,2017-08-14 04:37:03,"Hey, we have a limit to 350 characters here, so I can't reply to everything, but the modules comment seems unfair.

Wanted to reiterate at the top, that this is a good game, well worth a play through and the cash spent on it.  The below review is just honest feedback for the devs.  They still did a great job!  I've been a fan of P&C adventures since a small game from LucasArts called ""The Dig""  This game feels more like a modern throw back to that style.  Incorporating intuitive touch controls into this genre with fluidity.  The camera angles we're sticky at first, but once you figure out how to navigate, they flip to the best angle quick enough.  I felt the story's pace was off though.  It's slow for the first, 30 minutes or so.  Basically till your done with the bar.  After that your assembling a team for an OP and plot is dumped on you at a really fast pace.  I wasn't a fan of how you recruited team members, despite the explanation later.  (One key member, the informant, made less sense after the explanation.)  Th casual relationship between the protagonist and the CEO made little sense to me.    The ice cream shop vendor seemed like a red herring character that was overdrawn for the sake of puzzle mechanics.  I liked the overarching concepts the story touched on, had me guessing between a few possibilities till the story was laid out.  But the last sequence was confusing if not completely unnecessary.  I get that part of the moral fiber was about living with the concequence's of your choices, but it seemed tacked on at the last minute, especially since my character did the opposite of what I wanted him to do in the last moment.  I was bothered about half way through when I realized that I was coming to the end.  I wanted to have some serious questions answered, but sort of felt ""Disney Landed"" at the end (left with questions, but distracted by pretty lights)  But the truth is I enjoyed playing this game.
