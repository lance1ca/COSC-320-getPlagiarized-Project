I have an Note 4 as my personal phone and an iPhone as my work phone, and the trouble is that I paid for the premium version here on Android, yet it is missing features that I have on the free version of iPhone (Which is odd, it's usually the other way around.).  I like the app, however on the Apple version it prompts you with your prayer reminders throughout the day as well.  Very handy for those trying to keep a prayerful lifestyle. Outside of  that I think the app is great, and I certainly wouldn't switch to an iPhone because of it, they are too far behind in technology. Especially when compared to a Note.
