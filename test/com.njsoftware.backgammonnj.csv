The only problem is the frequency of doubles.  Especially 4.4.  But you can roll your own dice if you want.  4-4 happened 3.10% when it should be happening 2.78%. That doesn't sound like much, but it's noticeable.  Every other double result is very close to the expected 2.78% rate.   Also, I can view the next 100 rolls, and too often there are 30 or more sets of doubles in the queue.   At the moment, there are only 10 doubles in the next 100 rolls.  One person will get 7 of them (14%) the other person will get 3 (Just 6%!!!).   I just checked a second installation my tablet.  Of the next 100 rolls, 15 are doubles.   But 10 of 50 go to one person (20%) and 5 of 50 go to  the other person (10%).   Sounds like a problem to me.    When I roll my own dice, my chances of winning are greater, but that's just impossible to do unless I'm playing at home.  The playing logic is excellent, but I'd like to be able to ""undo"" more than the current move.   That would help me get better, and every now and then your finger makes a mistake and you want to take it back but can't.

There is an option to enter your own dice rolls for those that can't believe they were beaten fairly. The program has a nice interface which is easy to use. If I could suggest some improvements then it would be:  1) have more levels - I'm a reasonable player (I've won a few of competitions) and I can beat it on hard but I nearly always loose on expert level (I guess I'm not an expert :( ). Unfortunately there are no levels between hard and expert.  2) better hints - equity scores per move are available but it could be much easier to access 4) online play - it would be nice to play other players on fibs etc.  Overall I'm very pleased with the program.

Since you're familiar with GnuBG, then surely you can export multiple match files from BGNJ and import them into GnuBG. GnuBG can analyze the luck factor for BGNJ, see that it's honest, & perform analyses to rate BGNJ's skill level.",2013-03-21 17:12:06

Would like to have choice of boards and online play - maybe the next upgrade? AI plays very well - extremely aggressive, as one critical reviewer noted. Teaching me not to fear taking outrageous risks when circumstances require it. Feels great when those moves pay off and who cares if they don't.    The dice are not fixed, it's so easy to check. If they seem fixed to you, despite clear evidence to the contrary, then you have to adjust your own perceptions and you might become a better player as a result. Random dice constantly produce unexpected results, that's because they are random.  Eg six doubles in a row is no less random than any other sequence of six throws, unless you are able to predict it. It's going to happen every 1,000 or so games, so several times a day across all players of this app, I imagine.    Good thing about the skill stats is you can lose games, but still feel satisfied that you played skillfully. Works the other way too, of course.",5,3,1.7,2012-08-23 02:34:44,,
