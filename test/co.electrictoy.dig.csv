Don't be put off by the graphics if you're new to old school gaming, this game has loads of gameplay and replay value that'll have you come for more.  It also takes a bit strategy, like avoiding enemies and falling earth that sometimes randomly breaks away from above.  Like I said, it's reminiscent of Mr. Driller and Dig Dug, so that's a good thing.  The game feels different every time you play it because it's randomly generated (or at least it looks like it is), which is good.  I think that any retro game fan will ""dig"" the threads this game is wearing (ha-ha).  On top of everything else, it's light weight; a little more than 8mb.  I've seen games with minimal graphics and sounds like this topping at a whopping 30-40mb, for whatever reason.
