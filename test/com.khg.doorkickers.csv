Its so satisfying making a plan at the very start of a mission just to have it fail immidietly. That sounds weird but if it fails, it means you get to spend time perfecting it which is the most fun part. Door kickers is a great game, i couldn't recommend it more.

The planning phase is a nightmare. You go to zoom, end up resetting all of your points. You go to move a character to a door, and the door overlay covers the player's dot, so you can't then select them. Having to choose what direction the characters are looking is extremely irritating too.

My first issue is when you first download you have an option to name your squad. But only numbers seem to work and you can only input one and then your keyboard wont work and closes if you try to type anything. The only fix I found was to restart the game or reinstall the game. Which I've done 5 times. Same goes for naming your squad. Next is when you get in the game. I couldn't even move my guys clicking on them did nothing.,1,19,1.1.22,2020-05-09 14:18:37,,

If you zoom and look closely like the assaulter class you can visualize that it is holding a m4 even you are using a different gun same with the other class also some of the voice acting maybe you could add some female voices specially in the game there are female characters.

You are in charge of a SWAT team of officers and tasked with 1. threat elimination, hostage rescue, bomb defusing missions, etc.  For each mission completed the experience of your officers increases, making them more efficient and unlock talent points for each class (pistol, rifle, shotgun). You also gain points towards locking up better weapons!  You are given the option of where to place your officers before breach and then draw the path you want them to follow, down to the detail of in what direction to look. When faced with a door there are multiple options as to how to enter (kick in the door, lock-pick, demolition charge) and if you want to use a flash bang, stinger grenade etc.  The only complaint I have with this game is that the paths for each individual officer is not locked when drawing paths. When playing this on a mobile phone I have on many occasions accidentally moved the path of the wrong officer, resulting in me having to do the whole path all over again with that officer.

Well that's essentially the core gameplay of the game. Plan the raid, then execute it. It's got to be the most interesting Strategy game I have ever, other than the first Homeworld game. So what is it really like? Is it fun? Should you download it? It's like an RTS with a totally non linear control system. Each mission begins with a planning mode, then the deployment. The planning mode is very in depth. First you choose which officers you want to use. There are several factors involved in this, as there are 5 classes to choose from, which you unlock as your squad level increases. You can outfit them with a wide array of weaponry and kit, which you also unlock with star points, the unlock currency which you accumulate by playing missions and leveling up your officers. There is also an ability tree in the form of a squad doctrine, which allows your troopers to preform better with the weaponry you have assigned to them. YOU CAN RESET AND CHANGE THE DOCTRINE BEFORE ANY MISSION, SO THAT IT WORKS WITH THE LOAD OUT OF YOUR SQUAD. If you have ever played a tactical shooter like Swat 4 or one of the earlier (i.e BETTER) Rainbow Six games you can imagine what kind of equipment is available to use. So once you've figured out what you want your team to use you move onto the next phase of planning. There are two ways you can do this. You can make a full plan for the raid and then execute it to see if your tactics are successful, or you can make a partial plan and then continue to make it up as you go, based on the development of the situation, which is made possible by being able to pause the game mid raid. I personally like to experiment with both. Depending on the scenario one may prove superior than the other. what you're wanting is an end result in which no troopers are killed and the raid is finished under the desired time. This will earn you a three star rating on that mission, which gives the officers on that mission a higher XP reward. The controls are... Interesting. You may have read that a full plan for an officer can be wiped by accident rather easily, while this is true it becomes much less of a risk with practice. I play on my RAZER phone, which has a nice big screen but if you have a rather small screen on your phone I suggest getting the game on your tablet, if you own one. Either way it doesn't take long to master the controls. A good way to minimise the risk of scrubbing a plan by accident is to create waypoints often, there are strong tactical advantages to doing this other than insurance against your shaky hands or bumpy ride in the car. You can hold down your finger on any part of the individual officer path and orientate the direction the officer is facing, very useful for turning corners where bad guys are sure to be lurking, or for watching the backs of your team as they set up for a door entry. This also creates a way point, so if you make a mistake you can delete that part of the path safely without deleting the whole raid plan for that officer. Another way of doing this is to assign a go code, which is used primarily for synchronization but handily creates a waypoint. That's all I will say as I have said a whole lot already. Is it fun? Yes. Should you download it? Yes.",5,6,1.0.90,2018-10-12 03:30:18,,

Single missions range from short and simple tutorial levels and basic layouts, to long and complicated, multi-level scenarios. It should be noted, the adding of multi-story buildings is the clunkiest of mechanics in the game but was added at fervent community request, even though the game devs warned of the engine's in ability to handle exactly what the community requested.

Some control issues such as accidentally touching a dotted line and ruining several minutes of meticulous raid planning for one character.

until clicking on one of the units while planning the level. The other is 
the looking controls, have to hold my finger on the planning line for a 
moment before being able to control where the unit looks. Sometimes, in 
tight spots where lines overlap, I have to press multiple times to get the

the controls. Slight movements tend to wipe out trajectories and if you 
have paths croasing over each other, manipulating the characters gets 
tricky. Somebody made a suggestion that selecting the character first to 
lock in would sort the issue out. I agree. Overall, a womderful game. Just

you kind of have to pause the game, it's hard to make one continuous plan

Plus, it's fairly challenging but not to a rage inducing degree, it has a very intellectually based level of difficulty. Although my only complaint is that on devices such as phones the controls can be a tiny bit iffy for people with big hands, but that's easily negated with a stylus which is how I play, it allows me to make more precise movements than I could with my clumsy thumbs.

Though the controls can sometimes be tricky and a bit frustrating (a way to lock in the directions given to a trooper so you can't accidentally delete them when trying to interact with other parts of the interface would be nice), the core gameplay is flawlessly designed. Successfully executing a mission based on a single, well-considered plan is incredibly satisfying. On top of that you have a slick interface, graphics polished to a shine, an awesome post-industrial soundtrack, a rewarding leveling system, tons of missions, plenty of variety in objectives, and mission achievements that encourage perfectionism. I wish the Android version allowed you to download user-generated maps, but I guess this is to account for the $16 price difference between the PC and Android versions. Otherwise, the Android version works great both as a pick-up-and-play timekiller and as a high-caliber strategy game-- strategy aficionados should well know how rare it is to find both in one package. Anytime I'm waiting for something, I whip out my phone and play a couple missions. This is overall a gem of a game, one of the Android's best strategy titles and more than worth its meager price tag.

The classes have all been worthwhile, the maps offer enough variation, and the load out customization is good. Reasonably challenging as well. All in all it's good.   Only thing it lags behind in is controls. It can be difficult to manage individual operators once you have multiple paths close to each other. Simple fix would seem to be requiring you click on the operator first so that the controls lock in on him until you change to the next one.

Sure, but once you get used to the controls and if you love tactical realism games, you will never want to uninstall this.  This is the one mobile game i know i will never uninstall, it's fun to grind gear, the levels are unique, the game forces you to play tactically (if you wanna keep your full squad alive) and it's overall just a fun experience. The only issues i have with the game, however are 1) sometimes when trying to toss a flash through a door via the flash option, the flashband hits the corner of the door and lands back, ruining the flash and clear (and yes, the flashbang is not at an impossible angle to toss.) 2) a multitude of times have i had some complications with the line-dragging system to where I'll mess up the line and have to restart the pathway. For instance, say you have a squad go down a hallway and are stacked, there is no way to choose which line to choose from since the pathway lines are all on top of each other, and i've even had issues with picking individual units and end up messing up their pathway. 3) discloser: i totally understand that making graphics and artwork for a game is NOT easy, so this i will let slide since, again, the game is really a lot of fun. But i just feel that the character models are too... Cartoony. And that they just dont fit with the realistic design of the maps. If perhaps they were modified to where the animations werent as choppy and perhaps make the models look more realistic/ fit with the environment of the map, it would really make the game more surreal and really help with the simulation aspect.  Sorry for any typos for this was not reviewed at the time that i made this. this game will provide me with DAYS of gameplay and i look forward to if the game gets updated (especially if the isses above are looked into)",5,0,1.0.70,2017-10-26 15:19:14,,

Positives: Great Concept. Big Potential, Could be Lots of Fun & Addictive.  Negatives: The download for the game is 500mb. Then you have to download another 500mb, totalling out at 1gb+. I expected with a game that size, Expected the Graphics to be a lot better than the pics, they weren't as good as the pics. If the graphics & controls were close to being as good as other Top Down games such as Space Marshalls or Last Day on Earth, I would of Happy but the graphics are just not good. The controls are also a good concept need polishing. The game froze on me 2/3 of the 1st 3 times I played it, in the middle of the match. It continued to Freeze & Restart to the Main Menu, & it was Slow getting back there. The characters movements seem choppy & not fluid or smooth. The center button & the menu button for the characters needs to be Off Center so that we can see our character. Also I would like to see the entire character, head, legs, arms, his body like in the other Top Dwn games I named above. I feel like I'm moving 2 dots in between the lines. The buildings, houses, walls, everything the entire environment could be upgraded with a Graphics enhancement & an Artist. I dont know thr game isn't already their with it being 1gb+. That amazes me in its self. I imagine with some help from another developer that could be achieved. I don't think it ever will be, or why would it not already be that way?  Side Notes: Could be a Great Game, like a Top Game, Editors Choice. It's just not their & I doubt the developer will take the game in the direction they need to, to get it their. Good Luck, I'll check back in the future & see if it's gotten any better, like I said I really wanted to like it.",3,1,,2017-10-02 02:34:43,,

I keep accidentally clicking on another character's path when paths overlap. Maybe a way to lock the paths were done with?  - during planning I can't plan the path and actions on the next floor up  That's it. These two small issues in no way takes away from this great game!

The game is not without issues though. Game feels a bit clunky, trying to move waypoints or pressing buttons with my fingers, though I probably should have expected that. Sometimes the audio doesn't generate when it is suppose to, such as the sound when a suspect is killed. The latter may just be my crappy tablet, but maybe other people have this problem as well. That's about all the grievances I have. Only thing I want from this game now, is the ability to get mods working in the android version :D.                                     EDIT: clunkiness was fixed with a booster app, and so far no sound problems except the occasional. Now my only problem is to stop myself from raging when I screw up, :)",5,3,1.0.55,2015-10-03 20:11:00,"Didn't know about the sound issue, will look into it!
