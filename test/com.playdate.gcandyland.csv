I was so excited to see a Candyland app. I was made to believe it was just like the computer game I played as a child! I LOVED that game so much and was ready to pay whatever to share that joy and play it with my daughter. So I bought it on my phone and my daughters tablet so we could play at the same time. Only to have it take about 15 minutes and have it be garbage! Hasbro, seriously I would pay decent money to have the EXACT SAME 1999 interactive Candyland!",1,41,1.3,2020-07-22 13:40:34,,

However if you plan on getting this don't assume it's going to be same as the computer game from 20 something years ago. It's quite different. The majority of it is tap and swipe only. You have some matching and sorting, but that's it. Very short, which is good for the age group they are targetting here. Still very cute and well made for what they were trying to do with it",4,13,,2020-06-02 18:29:19,,

Not 2.99. Graphics are good but the two kiddos I downloaded this for couldn't play together. One watched the other one play the whole game (in 10 min) and was disappointed to find out when it was her turn that it was the exact same challenges. Just needs some improvement or needs to be free.
