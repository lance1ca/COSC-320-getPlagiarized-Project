So many glitches and the games been out for a long time. Expensive for the quality of the game. Might as well include all classes for that price. Don't waste your time it's fun at first and easy, but it should be challenging to a degree. Also total rip off of Diablo 2.",2,14,4.1.0,2020-03-19 19:30:38,,

Looks like a cash grab, for a game that is usually 9.99? you gotta be kidding me.. as far as the actual gameplay it isn't that hard, push in the direction you wish to attack on the right, tap on the right to jump, move on the left, that's all easy to understand, when you go to select skills it's easy to take a skill unintentionally, by pressing and holding the skills before you get points you can see what they do so you can make the right choices, The cashgrab mentality is just ugly in my eyes. Edit 2/21/20 If you leave your tablet set, the screen goes dark, isn't set to stay on top and activ. The liscense checking on the DLC while offline occurs about 3 hours after disconnecting, aproxmately 8 times a day, does my liscense really need to be checked that often? why isn't it done ONCE and stored?!?! am using a SMT-510 and a SMT-380 (Samsung Tab A, one is a 8"" the other a 10"". Edit: 3/10/20: The new art for Melviuses wrath is cheezy looking, up till the end, at which point it is extreme dark, looks terrible really, 420 sign in landscape now.. tell tale mark, was a descent game up till last update, now you have to hunt down the way-portals and it is getting more and more diablo 2 ish, developer seems to not really care about anything but selling IAP's, cause lets be honest, i got this game a couple weeks ago and all, and I reported about the IAP's not working offline to them but lets be honest, this game has been around a long time now, way over the amount of time it should take to fix such a thing, obviously they don't really care anymore, it started as a labor of love but now it is just a job and they don't seem to like it really. before the last update there was a miniboss at the exit of the level, but now not all levels seem to have a mini-boss, and whats more you have to hunt them down (they appear as a statue (wish they showed it on the map if you passed it by, like a red dot rather than yellow). weapons you had before the update are now mostly useless (in offline games), they show up as melee_weaponxx and their animations are now broken, a black cone eminates out and you can't really see what your aiming at. The darkness of Melviuses lair has made Melvius on nightmare impossible for my hell level character because it is so dark and the balls coming at you are black with red points, you can't see them very well, was better with a lighter floor. Art department needs fired. IF you already own this and are considering the stash upgrade, let me tell you, when you log in in offline mode and dont have a wifi connection, everything in those 100 additional spaces is lost. So if your gonna buy it, i recommend you don't take in over 100 items, or you could be at risk (aka ""don't use it"") which defeats the point in buying it to begin with. The CHARACTERS ""stash"" is then 200 and their inventory 200, but as soon as your offline, back to 100/100, once again, was better before the update. My storage doesn't update even after i do start the game online but play in single player. Online multiplayer is working now. The guys at Kalypso Media fixed this issue with DLC ages ago, Project Highrise works properly now because of it, wish this one did. I'm surprised blizzard hasn't sued them for this. If this game worked right it would be one of the best mobile action rpgs on the market, but because of the way dlcs work for the end user , because they don't. The funniest part is this is a diablo clone, they are making money of off someone else's work, and google and steam are profitting off of that as well, they don't seem to mind being on the end of the offender as a trademark and copyright offender.",2,117,4.0.6,2020-03-11 17:26:29,,

When you first start up the game, there's no explanation of the controls whatsoever, and worse, many screens (inventory, character selection, etc) cannot be controlled at all with the controller (other than hitting ""B"" to back up a screen). The game also frequently seems to forget a controller is attached, but hitting the start or select button to bring up the pause menu causes the controller to begin working again. Aside from the controller issues, there are others. First, the game lags and stutters, even on my Nvidia Shield K1 (I hate to think what it might do to less powerful devices!). Second, again, there is zero explanation of anything in the game (and it's complex enough to need some). The clothing doesn't work in single or multi-player (and I have ensured I'm choosing the right slot). The game sometimes force closes when trying to navigate the multi-player room selection screen. And if you hit pause in single player, it doesn't actually pause the action, so your character gets mobbed and killed if you need to do something else for a few seconds. This latter oversight is a *huge* issue in any mobile action type game. That said, if everything in this game *did* work correctly, it would be a five star game.
