Be warned though, AOM is an action rpg that progresses really quickly! Best if savored over several days.  IMO it plays more like a Zelda title than a Square Enix classic (in terms of puzzles, dungeons, combat, and the timing of obtaining new toys throughout the game), but the way the story/plot progresses is pretty similar to how Secrets of Mana progresses (though AOM seems a lot shorter). If you liked Swordigo on android, this is a nice game for following that (Swordigo has no sequel but I think we all want one after playing it - while AOM is not a platformer, the RPG nature of character development in this game probably inspired the likes of Swordigo, and the animation/graphics are very similar to that game too) I love the animation in this game also and I don't normally notice that kind of thing.
