I have both the History and Science cards but having this information in digital form is so handy and expected in this day and age (especially for the price). We love casting/mirror imaging the app on our TV. So not having these features on the app is a bummer. Switching from our hand written board to the app on the tv screen really helps keep their attention. Its also the only way we can look at all the information together and read along (the cards are too small for a family to huddle around and follow along). The geography graphics are confusing because it's voomed in so close and doesn't closely mimic what's on the Geography Trivium Tables.
