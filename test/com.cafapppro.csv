Simple, direct, easy to use.  Had it for a few days and it already seems to be helping me sleep better at night, it makes it very easy to see when you've gone overboard with the caffeine and should slow it down.  There are other free caffeine tracker apps out there, but they are not as good, you get what you pay for.

I should be allowed to enter in a drink at a future time, say if I'm going to drink 1 hr from now and I wanted to compare the effects of a coffee vs a soda.   There is also no option to indicate rate of drinking. Whether I chug my coffee or sip it over an hour, the app has no way of distinguishing. Thus the graph will always look the same - a cycle of spiking and decaying.   Graph: The numbers on the X and Y axes are so small that you have to squint to read them. You must add the ability to zoom in/out if nothing else.   The notifications need to be overhauled. There should be more granular options, say If I want to be notified ONLY when I go below the minimum threshold.
