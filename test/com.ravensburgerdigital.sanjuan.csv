The gameplay is fairly straightforward, but the AIs do not employ different strategies. It would be nice if they did so on a rotating basis.  What I would also like to see is the inclusion of both the 1st and 2nd expansions of San Juan - The New Buildings, and The Events. Perhaps those expansions can be optioned in.   In addition, San Juan is now in it's 2nd edition with updated effects for Guild Hall and Prefecture. There is even a new card now called The Hut. It would be nice if the android app version is updated to reflect all the changes the 2nd edition brings to the table.
