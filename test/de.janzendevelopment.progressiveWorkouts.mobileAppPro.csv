It is based on the reddit recommended body weight fitness routine and makes it completely customizable and also allows you to create your own progressions and workouts,5,0,1.9.4,2020-09-19 13:11:43,,

Initially it was not very intuitive but once you get the hang of it it's very easy to use and minimalist app. So I bought the pro version. It uses the updated bodyweight recommended routine from reddit. Couple of suggestions - 1. add feature to let non-US users change date format to dd/mm/yy instead of US style. 2. Videos for advanced exercises or feature to let user link YouTube videos,4,1,1.9.4,2020-09-12 23:24:45,,

The default workout follows reddits bodyweight fitness subreddit's recommended routine. It's easy to modify the workouts to a degree, but be warned that the number of exercises in it's library isn't the most extensive, so if you like getting really creative it might not be the best option for you. For me though this app is excellent, and I'd recommend it to anyone to try.",5,0,1.9.4,2020-05-08 16:54:10,,

I have since moved on to Antranik's intermediate PPL routine (rings based) and bought the Pro version to be able to enter them as custom workouts and to support the devs work.

Only thing I noticed that's missing is on the skill days after the 'skill work' the mobility work only has the pancake mobility. It's missing the option to change it out for general mobility, overhead mobility, and front splits. Would love to have this added! Still a great app and definitely worth the purchase!",5,1,1.9.4,2019-11-17 08:59:41,Thanks a lot. Good point. I'll try to cover it in the future.,2019-11-17 08:58:36

A few minor complains: - It would be absolutely great, if the timer and countdown sounds could get played as alarm instead of media sounds. I would love to have my phone on DnD while training - Deadbug gif doesn't play - Google Fit sync would be great - Sometimes rest countdown stops if app is in background",5,2,1.9.0,2019-08-12 03:58:56,,

Also, I rebooted my phone and when I reinstalled the app all my workout history was gone.
