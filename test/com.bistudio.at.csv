Love the game. Just too short.  After finishing all the levels, not much fun to play again. New update fixed the sluggish bug. But after all 4 soldiers entering the dam, the game won't progress to the next step. Just stuck there without anyone to control. Hope next update fix it.",3,6,1.2758,2013-10-22 06:22:16,,

My only complaint is the controls need to be refined. Sometimes it is hard to get the soldiers to move where you want and just panning the camera view across the map is slow and tedious. I hope those issues get resolved soon seeing as the PC version probably won't have these issues.,4,1,1.2364,2013-09-22 09:30:49,,
