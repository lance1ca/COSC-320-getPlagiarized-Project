The game is almost unplayable, or at least far less enjoyable. The ground is pixelated, creatures and animations are distorted (particilarly Ballphins), Packim Baggins is invisible and does not follow, making him unusable, walls are invisible, I mean it's bug city! I'm no longer losing saved games (thanks), but this is barely playable! And right on my Xmas break when I have lots of time to play! Please fix!",5,4,0.19,2018-12-30 09:51:17,,

Mechanics of the game are waaay too complicated for a mobile game, so I'd say some ""light edition"" (NOT easy mode, I remember I can configure world) would be appropriate. Combat situations really ask for a normal joystick - tapping away from enemies is horrible. Some small details, like having to long-tap the object, choose ""Hammer"", long-tap etc. until the object is destroyed - are really annoying. Or like drag&dropping a cone and then choosing ""Plant"" each time. For the love of god, this game is very time-limited and these things steal BUNCH of time.

Very frustrating as I'd found the volcano, doydoys, wooden thing etc. and finally finished my coffee plantation, halfway through setting  up elephant plants to farm spiders. Probably should have listened to other reviews. :(  IIove the Don't Starve franchise, and this game is a blast. It presents new challenges and a different vibe than the original. However, this game did not port to mobile as well as Reign of Giants did, at least not on my device. I find the persistent bugs irritating because they affect most actions in the game, while the occasional glitches in RoG hardly bothered me at all.  I also sincerely hope the Home Sea Home update is added to Pocket Edition Shipwrecked sometime soon!  These issues occurred on a Samsung Galaxy S8.    1. The top 3 slots of chests are cut off by the top of the screen and almost impossible to use, and actions like placing traps, planting coconuts, placing structures and dropping items are similarly difficult to control because they seem to occur ~2 cm higher than my finger & the item/structure's  icon on the screen. This also affects my backpack and inventory, but as these are at the bottom of the screen, it is workable. The rest of the screen including the crafting menu and HUD are NOT cut off, and tapping on resources like Grass to harvest it is not affected. This is the biggest issue I have at this time.    2. Certain tools do not respond to the green action button. The hammer is especially irritating. Fireflies also cannot be caught with a net/green action button during the day, but they CAN be at night, so this may be intentional.    3. I miss the way that RoG paused when I opened the inventory to reorganize or take stock! This may also be an intentional change, but it was very useful when caught out at night - nothing like wasting a few seconds looking for your torch, realizing you used it up and getting killed by Charlie.    I end up burning a significant amount of daylight just trying to control where I place items, use my chests and inventory, etc. Still a fabulous game, but I experienced 0 bugs with RoG except occasional crashes and cute little moleworms stuck in the ocean.",4,0,0.10,2018-01-08 13:00:19,,
