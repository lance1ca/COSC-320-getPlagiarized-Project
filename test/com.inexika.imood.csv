Helps us to remember to cover everything that's going on in my life.  Features are limited though.  Basically a glorified journal with some gimmicks.  Maybe the charts will be more helpful in the future but you can't zoom in on them and look at specifics.  Just trends.  I get that that is the point but being able to break those charts down a little more might be where they actually become helpful.  4 stars until the charts are more detailed for sure and if any useful features could be added to make this app even better, that would improve the quality and value.  If you are using this with your therapist or find another usefulness to it, great, but don't think it's just goana help you get better or understand yourself better without working at it a little bit.",4,6,2.9,2017-07-02 23:22:42,,
