There are many aspects to each and every table that I know I'll enjoy once I find them. Tables are fairly cheap right now at $1 a piece although the normal price is $2 but I think that is a fair price for the work that goes into them. The reasons I don't rate the game higher is because on my phone (Pixel 2 XL) the game is cut off a little on the bottom so I can't really tell what the menus are for and it is slightly difficult to launch the ball at full power. The second reason is that it is absolutely impossible to bulk buy all the tables. You have to buy them one by one and you cannot add them to a cart. I did buy all the tables and I'm excited to play them all but I hope at least the cutoff issue gets resolved",4,2,5.0,2017-12-15 13:19:00,,

Only problem is some devices allow you to download the game but then do not play it well or at all. So someone should be testing this more on more devices and then they need to restrict what devices this game is supported on.  That would help people not feel ripped off when they buy it and it fails to work.  Only other complaint I got is these tables do not share scores with the main Zen Pinball app. And to further confuse matters is you can buy each of these tables as DLC for Zen Pinball.  But despite those 2 things I still think any pinball fan should have this and ZP!,4,0,1.0.2,2013-10-11 06:22:47,,

Mini-game with the floating practice blaster, HOW? Jackpots: HOW? So frustrating to not know if you're aiming for the correct path/object. Finally, the ball goes to the far left or right side of the table and down past the flippers way too often.

The game it's self is very good with good graphics and audio. A keeper but I would like to see improvers on ui. Adding an extra star from 3 stars to 4 stars beside the itself merits it.

The artwork and animations are gorgeous and the gameplay and many goals are well implemented. I only observe two problems,  neither a dealbreaker:  The feel is just a wee bit stiff. Not to disparage your app, but Pinball Arcade has a more solidly realistic feel to me, though as one with zero design experience I can't say precisely why. I do think there's some wiggle room for optimization. 'Episode V' runs smoothly most of the time, but 'Boba Fett' occasionally has some annoying choppiness to it and 'Clones' suffers more frequently from these annoying hesitations as the data flow chokes up. I just don't think that should be happening on my nearly new Tegra 3 powered Asus Infinity tablet.  I'm definitely happy to play this daily, but I gotta deduct one star for the intermittent choppy performance with two of the three tables.
