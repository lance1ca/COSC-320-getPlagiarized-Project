With any regular android, the results are impressive without any slowdown. It offers filters, autodetects most controllers, has a nice UI,... it is very well done.  Like most emulators, it requires some time to get configured and find the proper ROMs. Thus, don´t pay much attention to all the 1 star comments saying the emulator does not run.   Still, I find it could be vastly  improved, if only it offered support for Neo Geo CD and probably links to downloadable guides, The idea of getting the CD soundtracks, with no loading times in a handheld could be like the ultimate NG experience.",4,1,1.5.26,2015-04-30 03:58:35,,

Its usable for the ''Vs'' series of games because the games themselves have ''auto guard''.
