The lore is immersive and keeps you hooked, the story-line is deep and interesting. The game-play can get a bit samey after a while, however that doesn't matter because the art style is beautiful with a happy mix of pixel art and 3D models. I would recommend this game to anyone who has played and enjoyed FTL.",5,15,1.4.0,2020-06-25 07:10:49,,
