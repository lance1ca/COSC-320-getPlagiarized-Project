I love the rift arena in the first level. very rewarding item if you clear the level.,4,2,DARKNESS,2019-07-11 02:47:45,Do not forget that this is a mobile game. and a large selection of levels and monsters loads it up. This can cause problems for people with weak smartphones. I have an idea to add tests. (short but difficult levels with a good reward) to increase gameplay. + The game will continue in the new update. As for items: 12 weapons and 5 sets of armor,2019-07-11 11:55:32

Challenging and addictive. Can play for 3 min or 30min perfect for a mobile game. Only suggestion would be to have the screen move left to right a bit faster with the player movement. It can be quite annoying when changing directions during a boss fight and having the enemy off screen.,4,13,DARKNESS,2019-07-04 15:31:32,hello thank you I'll do it.,2019-07-07 08:45:56

Theres a game called oddmar i think that has controls like that. it frees up screen space also i like the game but the controls are absolutely terrible. you can change the placement but the jump button is 2 times the si pze of the others and it makes placement difficult. bad controls = poor user experience",2,4,NEW WAY,2019-06-22 05:30:31,Hey.
