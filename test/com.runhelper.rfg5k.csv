They had a bridge to 5k app that I paid for, then changed the motivation quotes to scriptures and renamed the app ""run for God 5k"" .. so I no longer have access to the app I paid for and had to re-purchase this. Bonus - the old app (bridge to 5k) actually worked, this one does not. The old app knew how many runs and things you had and would tell you ""run 1 or 3"" this app is HORRIBLE - will say run 1 of 3 when you have 1 run. Added bonus - it tells you to run 3 miles.. how is it suppose to know? I'm on the treadmill and this app can't see that. TERRIBLE CASH GRAB, old app 10000x better, the company completely sold out.",1,5,2.0.3,2019-12-02 19:15:37,,
