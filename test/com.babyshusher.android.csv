No more chapped lips from hours of shushing!   However, it does have its flaws.  Even in the latest version, it seems to randomly stop shushing (this seems to happen more often when it isn't the active app).  The app itself doesn't crash, it just stops making the shush noise.  Also, the equalizer option doesn't seem to work terribly well.  In a totally silent room, it will continue blasting at max volume after the 3 minute mark, when it should start quieting down (this is on a Motorola XT907).    Lastly, the ""nag screen"" displayed every time you start the app reminding you that there is now a shushing noise machine is rather annoying, especially when you are trying to calm a colicky baby.  It really should only show up once per install.",3,3,1.0,2014-05-05 10:27:32,,
