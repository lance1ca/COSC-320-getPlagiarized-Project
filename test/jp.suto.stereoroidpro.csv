When I use this app recently no matter how careful I am with not tilting it, one of the two photos gets always turned sideways which is annoying because I haven't found a way to turn only one photo and that makes all the photos I take unusable as stereos. Is there a way of turning only one photo, or is that a possible addition for future updates? If not I would seriously reconsider using this app because it gets frustrating.  And the second thing is that somehow the stereo pairs always get mixed up after a while, so for all my photos I can never see two matching photos side by side. It is always one of one stereo pair and one of the next. Another feature which makes this app unusable, and considering I'm paying for this app I'm not too happy. I hope there is a way of fixing/improving these things.  Another suggestion I have is a better way of navigating all photos because once you get to 100s it gets annoying trying to find one specific photo. What I also noticed is that if I take a photo and then go to an older photo, the new photo has disappeared. I have to close and reopen the app before I can see it again. Hope this helps!",5,1,3.41,2020-04-27 00:29:57,,

It's loading speed of high resolution images is fast, supports the Gadmei, which I was having trouble finding compatible apps and still am for it. Parallax adjustments are cool although I have not used them.  I noticed a minor glitch on my Gadmei, it does not zoom more then 100% where it does on my LG Thrill which I can live with.   I only have 1 issue with the entire app, other then that it is truly awesome. Some of my MPO's don't view right where it does in all other apps. Which I'm sure is a minor alignment glitch reading the mpo. Couple of things that I think might be cool.  -Auto Parallax alignment for viewing -and a 2D to 3D real-time converter for 2D images like cyberlink does Side note: I've been using your other apps on my PC for several yrs now.You have no idea how much you've made my life easy by developing your apps and giving them to the public.There is still not much in the way of 3D image editing out yet, or tools to batch edit or convert.I had 3D Steroid on my phone for a while, but did not realize it was by the same person until just now when I purchased the Pro Thank You",5,1,2.37,2013-01-17 23:25:01,,

Not having the ability to save in animated GIF makes this program useless to me.    Other than that, overall, the program seems to make sense, and potentially could have produced some pretty nice results.
