Automatic scheduled (and encrypted) backups to cloud (Drive/Dropbox/etc) are a real time saver. With the increasing use of messaging over emails in the business world these days, and considering legal and billing purposes, imho it's foolish not to have a messaging backup. There's also an included phone call record backup that's welcome for the same reasons, as well as transferring these records to different phones. The only issue I had (and it wasn't with this Pro version was 1) when I first used the free version to transfer sms and mms from a broken phone to a working phone via wi-fi: Twice the ~150MB transfer failed very near the end. Then for the third try I seemed to correctly guess that the phone was timing out during the the process and maybe that's due to Android 8.1's battery saver/optimization or something similar. So on that third time I would just touch the old and new phones occasionally to make sure they stayed visibly awake. The transfer completed 100% and the counts looked correct. And 2) After that transfer there were no messages showing in Android messaging. I quick check of the FAQ had a couple suggestions. For me, all I had to do was Clear Cache and Clear Data in Android's Messages, then all the restored messages appeared in Messages as desired.",5,47,10.06.120,2020-05-08 11:31:47,,

I have tried others before and none of them even come close to working as well as SBRP. The others partially work at best and mangle up conversations and freak out when it finds multi-person MMS conversations.  The real trick with this is to  either pop the SIM out of your old device (or put in airplane mode) then do the backup and store to cloud, etc. SBRP automates this for you. Then get your new device ready by fully updating (system, and apps) and install SBRP.. Don't put the your SIM into new phone yet. Retrieve your old phone backup from cloud (or wherever) and use SBRP to restore all your messages. Run your normal messaging app and let it get to know all the new messages that have suddenly shown up. Once that's complete, which may take a while, then you can put in the SIM and start using your new phone. Hasn't failed me yet in at least 5 upgrades. Also, setup a backup schedule.
