My reactions are fine. But when I get higher points and the beetle shines blue and I get a bonus point right before a turn plus having to hit another blue and also hit gold bars it almost blinds you from seeing the turns. I'd imagine this works fine on pc or console but on a phone screen this is just hard as nails. Plus you cant arrange the buttons. I find this impossible on landscape, so I use portrait.

I also have this game on PSVR and the Nintendo Switch and even though I'm not an expert at it or anything it has that 'just one more go' to it that it's a perfect game to play in small chunks. It looks gorgeous on the phone and massive kodos on the developers for not going for the 'free to play' route with the game and releasing it at a very fair price. The only thing they could add maybe is an easy mode which gives you more lives but less score.,5,12,1.10,2019-04-10 08:36:02,,

Really challenging and tests your ability to understand odd and strange rhythems. Dont lose hope if you get stuck, you can get through everything with practice and focus. Levels 5, 7, and 9 can be really brutal to understand at first because of the odd time signatures.
