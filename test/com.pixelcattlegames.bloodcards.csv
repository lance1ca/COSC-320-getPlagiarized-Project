Not sure why. The game will slowly load up and then crashes to desktop. I should have tried it out when I bought it. Grrr. My error in not trying it out quick enough.,1,1,1.0,2020-01-23 18:43:11,,

You will probably lose your first few games as you learn about which card synergies are best, but soon you'll find yourself tearing through baddies!
