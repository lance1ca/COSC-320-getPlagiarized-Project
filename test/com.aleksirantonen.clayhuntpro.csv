I used my instinctive lead, the one I use in real life but unfortunately it did not work. It seems that a weird constant distance slightly in front of the bird's head brings it down no matter its speed or direction. Maybe it is done so to simplify it and makes it accessible but this is not how it works in real life. Since this version is called Pro, I hope this will be improved to be more realistic...",3,2,1.4.0,2017-11-12 06:35:22,,

After playing the free clay hunt game thought this must be worth the money but it really isn't. The skeet and trap is so repetitive it's just all the same. The pigeon shooting is so unrealistic it's not even funny. The game gives you the idea you have to give the targets compensation in front to hit them and you don't you just aim straight at everything block it out with end of the gun and fire.  Really really disappointed wish I had never brought the game,2,3,1.0.3,2017-05-14 05:17:21,Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately it's impossible to please everyone.
