I literally switched back to android for this app! Okay maybe not entirely but it was indeed the first app I downloaded once I returned back to android. The interface is simple and easy to use. Locking the rules is a great feature and also having this as a learning tool as well can be very great to train yourself, especially for someone like me who doesn't know about musical keys or harmonic mixing yet. GET THIS APP! You won't regret it!",5,2,1.4.18537.1,2020-10-20 11:53:06,"thanks Rafael, this makes me very proud ;)",2020-10-20 13:30:29

One suggestion, would be great to have a feature where by you could flick between Camelot view and Circle of Fifths view *EDIT* creator is amazing! Listens to reviews and adapts the product to suit. This app ticks all the boxes now! Great product!",5,0,1.4.18537.1,2020-10-07 18:14:51,"Please note that I've submitted a new release that includes the cicle of fifths view. Currently the sharp and flat symbols are represented by a pound # sign and a lowercase ""b"". This is because I didn't find a font supporting the musical notation. In a future release this will be fixed. Thanks.",2020-10-07 03:42:56

Is there a fix or update that can fix this. I'll change my rating if we can fix this problem,2,2,1.3.17809.1,2020-08-01 09:59:46,,
