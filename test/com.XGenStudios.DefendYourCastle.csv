Thoroughly enjoy this game, but I8ss dropping the enemies in the castle to convert, the big Grey guys were better than the weird Pepsi guys. Don't regret my purchase one bit, but there does seem to be an issue with one achievement. I can't erase more than one enemy with one eraser. I have 1000+ wizards. I've tried dragging, rapid clicking, but can't get the 3 catapult 1 eraser achievement no matter what I try. Stuck at 59/60 because of it.",4,4,0.1,2020-06-21 10:38:45,,

Has a lot of potential of being the same as the wii version. However some of the ui/icons dont scale properly and look fairly compressed on a high resolution based display.,5,15,0.1,2020-03-23 13:08:23,,

I have found a probable bug in it, though. Touching either the credits or how to play button shows only the stick men running around. For as fun as that is to watch, this does prevent unlocking the Paying Your Dues achievement. This happened only in the version for Android. I have also purchased the version from Steam and it does not contain that bug. I do not know about the standalone version purchased from the Web site directly, as I did not purchase that version.",5,5,0.1,2019-08-21 14:10:39,,

If i were able to add a tiny critique, I would love to be able to get rid of the word ""Helth"" next to the health bar. You guys did a fantastic job with this game!
