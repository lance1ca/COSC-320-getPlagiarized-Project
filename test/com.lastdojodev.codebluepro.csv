Worked Rapid position last week and responded to six codes with this. Kept all six codes very organized until I could put them into Epic. Love the time stamp feature.,5,1,3.0,2021-01-18 08:10:23,,

I would like to have an option to add notes on events already added to the log, for example: event: endotracheal intubation shows on the log, would be nice to have a ""+"" toggle on the right to quickly add notes such as size and placement etc Or the ability to manually enter in cascading options to events Overall love it!

It would be better if the timers were countdown with a notification to let us know when rhythm check or next epi is due. Would really be helpful for short staffed hospitals like where I work where the code team has to improvise with a shortage of hands. This has been a great help to our ICU of 2 staff though. Looking forward to seeing the suggested improvements in the next update.,3,8,2.7,2019-12-09 07:02:20,Thanks for your review and we are considering your suggestions for the next version of the app. Thanks for your support.,2020-02-19 17:26:45

I do have a few requests / suggestions: 1) Remove the ability to delete an event, rhythm, medication during an active code. Deletion should require going into a Settings menu perhaps. During my codes I've almost deleted these accidentally when simply trying to select. 2) Add an alarm for when starting compressions, pulse check, epi, etc. is due. 3) Have a ability to add notes during the code such as depth of tubes Again, overall a great app that is very user friendly.",4,11,2.7,2019-09-09 18:30:09,,

There has to be another tone option. Whenever I use this to demonstrate with classes the rate of compressions we have to shut it off for fear of our ears bleeding. I do wish it defaulted to running the metronome instead of having to enable it each time. Second, I wish it didn't hold onto info B/C starting a new session it will always ask about saving old info which is a time waste in arrests.  I want to hit start upon opening the app, have the metronome start (or have that as an option to start on opening) and change the beep to something far less shrill.",3,2,,2018-02-15 10:14:46,,

Would also like to see a setting that y0u can mark 2 minute audio noise to let you know to look at the app and give another epi  or swap partners for cpr. Would love to see the beats be a consistent tone.   It's always chaos when working a code and sometimes we don't have time to constantly check the timer.would also like to see you be able to add or take other certain drugs or events.   Other than that.  It's simple and perfect.,4,2,2.1,2016-07-23 11:12:41,"Hi Travis, 
Thank you for the review. We would like to inform you that as of the latest version, the metronome is now a consistent beat/tone. You can swipe left/right to delete drugs, events, and logs. Please see the video above for an example. A 2 minute mark option is something we are working for the next version of the app.",2016-12-01 15:21:09
