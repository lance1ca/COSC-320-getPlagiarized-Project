I really like the content and I listen to the various meditations and practice on a regular. I want to rate it 5 starts for its content but the app is very buggy in itself and needs some improvement. I don't personally feel difficulty because of the bugs but I think it can keep people who are beginning from benefiting from the good content the app has to offer. Please consider improving and fixing the issues with the app.,3,3,4.3.11,2021-01-29 13:47:37,,

get the app. At the very least you waste $2, but as long as you don't run

It's a  practice - always trying, exploring, failing, coming back again, trying some thing different, growing my toolbox. It has also shown me that it doesn't always happen when I am still and doing nothing. I can do it while walking or cooking or busy online and I love that. That's what has made it stick for me.
