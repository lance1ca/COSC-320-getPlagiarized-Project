The creator put tons of thought into it and it's always being updated. Very handy to avoid confusing algae keys and also when there's no internet access.

Also has the ability for just looking up specific species in a list form. I use this quite often, especially for accurate photos for visual identification since it is often quite difficult to find good photos of algae that is labeled properly as the correct species.",4,3,1.2.3,2019-02-16 07:54:25,,
