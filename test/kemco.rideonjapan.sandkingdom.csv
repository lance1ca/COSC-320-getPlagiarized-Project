I've been a fan of Kemco since Fernz gate, and since been loving every new release! But this game for some reason doesn't have free gems which is always present on allof their premium release games. Will Update once the devs consider 😁",4,6,1.10g,2020-10-09 02:03:27,,

A huge design upgrade to Marenian Tavern Story, and you're a blacksmith. Extra cool because you custom create a party of 5 adventurers, from a selection of traditional rpg classes. Select from a variety of religions to add bonuses to each character class. Later on each character can also take a sub class. After a half hour of playing the trial version, I had to get this game. If you like monster battling, collecting materials and crafting, this is your game.",5,16,1.10g,2020-10-07 20:15:54,,
