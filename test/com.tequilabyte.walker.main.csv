And then when you get a mission where you have to avoid stepping on friendlies the game becomes unplayable. Bunch of suicidal lemmings that hide behind visual obstructions so you can't even tell if your stepping on them or not.",1,15,1.0.7,2020-05-20 21:28:53,,

Missions feel like too much work compared to the reward. Fixing your mech after each mission costs 1/3 of what you're paid. The walking mechanics is ok, takes some time to get used to but the weapon firing is a bit annoying. Your guns take longer to cooldown then what it takes to use them. Especially when you're firing and the aim keeps switching lanes missing majority of the enemies since they were all on one side. Takes the fun out of the game.",3,47,1.0.7,2020-05-19 21:00:22,,
