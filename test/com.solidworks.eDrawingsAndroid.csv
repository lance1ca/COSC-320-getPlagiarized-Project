I click on the ""Upgrade to Pro"" button and the splash screen comes up that gives me a summary of the Pro features with two buttons available, one that says ""Later"" and another button that says ""Continue"".  If I click the ""Continue"" button, nothing happens.  It makes the click sound and highlights monetarily, but does nothing.  The summary screen with the two buttons remains.  If I click ""Later"", the screen closes.  It appears that the mechanism for verifying purchases has a bug that can't handle a Google Account name change.  My original purchase of eDrawings was on September 10, 2015, and subsequently upgraded to eDrawings Pro on September 15, 2015.  On September 18, 2015, my Google Play account name changed.  Except for 3 days after initial purchase, I haven't been able to use the Pro features of the app, and I really, really need to access them now.  I opened a help case in 2015 and got a auto-reply email with a case number saying that I would be contacted, but never heard anything again.",1,31,7.3.6,2019-05-28 04:49:04,"Hi James,

I've was really looking forward to utilizing the Augmented Reality function within my design reviews, etc., however it still seems it is not functioning within the Android OS...  The what's new indicates it is now included, the button exists within the UI, however there does not seem to be a way to obtain the necessary AR Marker.  I noticed SolidWorks responded to a previous comment indicating that the ""Get Marker"" button should appear in the lower left corner after pressing the AR button, however I do not ever see this button...  Other than that, the app seems to function the same as before for me.  If someone can enlighten me as to something I'm doing incorrectly, I'd be all ears!  This is the only thing preventing me from spending the extra $7.99 for the PRO version of the app!",3,0,3.0,2015-08-21 06:13:11,"Hello Shawn,

There was an issue on some devices that caused the 'Get Marker' button to hide but a recent update should resolve this. Please try the update and let us know if you continue to see the issue.

After you press the AR button, you should see a 'Get Marker' button on the bottom left. The next screen should allow you to email the marker for printing.

Mostly just standard views, zoom, rotate and the PLAY button, but you can pinch to zoom while rotating, which can be nice and a pain at the same time (hard to stay normal to a normal view while zooming because of this).  Also, nearly every app is asking me whether it should be opened with eDrawings now (Open ColorNote with eDrawings?  Really???).  When opening a Gmail notification, it makes you choose between eDrawings and Gmail.  If you select Gmail and ""Just Once,"" then it will do it correctly that one time.  If you select Gmail and ""Always,"" it will hang your phone and then cause it to reboot - every time.  You really wouldn't think it would be that hard to solve these issues, would you?  Install this if you want to go through most of your apps and have to re-associate them with their rightful program while hitting ""Always"" (the other apps don't crash the phone when doing this, but who wants to go through these steps?).
