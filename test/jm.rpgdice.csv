Thanks for trying our app. The app wants you to sign into your Google account so it can save your roll favorites and history using Google's Firebase service. This would allow you to access your favorites and history across devices. 
The app WILL NOT use your Google account for anything other than that.
Thanks",2019-06-04 07:46:23
