It calibrates (both EMF and vibration) very well and is very stable on my Moto G6 and HTC M10. I can leave this running all night at home and hardly hear a peep out of it. When I use Vovilus II in an investigation it most often triggers a response in the same time frame as my other devices.

It's extremely sensitive to the point of having to recalibrate all the time. The EMF DETECTION seems to work but only for a short time before you have to recalibrate it. The VIBRATION DETECTION is worthless. I've tried this on several sturdy tables, calibrated it and it still will not work correctly. Yes. I watched your YouTube video over and over and my opinion is you need to fine tune this app, and provide an update.",3,29,8.0,2020-07-28 23:50:05,"Devices have a ton to do with how the app works.
