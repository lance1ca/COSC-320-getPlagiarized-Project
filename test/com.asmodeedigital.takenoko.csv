They can sometimes be hit or miss or just predictable in their choices. No games were available in the online section... not sure what's up with that. There's an expansion available in game too that I might try out soon.,5,1,0.49,2020-01-10 14:12:38,,

First is Online Mode - it gets stuck on the other player's turn and freezes. Tried Online multiple times to no avail. Other cons are less gamebreaking: no undo option like Pandemic (the tiles/cards I understand, but it would be nice for the other options), having to hit 'OK' for each AI player's turns, no fast-forward for AI players, no session save.",2,13,0.49,2020-01-03 19:18:40,,

Worked on my old phone when I got a Pixel 4 as an upgrade I haven't been able to load the game. All that happens is that the icons for the various companies load. Then the loading screen briefly appears followed by a black screen. It's a shame because the game itself is a good adaptation of the board game (though an undo button would be nice). Without the above issues it's worth the price and I'd rate it at 4 stars.,1,4,0.49,2019-12-25 12:35:28,,
