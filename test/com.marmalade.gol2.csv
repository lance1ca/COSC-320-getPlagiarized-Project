The reason I give the game a 4 star is because It feels like it's watered down and extremely short. I would really love to see a longer board. I'm excited for the new road maps. As you can tell the biggest issue I have is the game feels extreamly short. Also the next update can you guys add more customization. Can we please have a LEADERBOARD 🙏.

The graphics are great and she loves seeing what happens when she makes different life choices. With that said: 1. We would like to see at least 4 different player tokens so there are not 4 wheels, skateboards or birds when looking at the aerial view of the game board. Once a token is selected, it can't be used by another player. 2. Is there a way to personalize the name for Player 2, 3 and 4 when there are 4 humans playing? We tried everything in the edit mode including tapping the name plate and nothing works to change the name. The names do change when they are computer players. If there is a way to change to names when in ""human"" mode, it is not intuitive. 3. As other players mentioned we do wish there was an option for a longer board. I like the short version that exists right now but when we have time for a longer game, another few routes would be great, with more house spaces, salary spaces and other perks. Does not seem to be very many house spaces, we've played many games when neither of us had more than one degree and both had zero houses. We do love the 2nd chance spots!! 4. The ""risk"" road seems boring since it's all Wheels of Fate with a few Taxes spots sandwiched in. We hate landing on a Wheel of Fate because we ALWAYS get Taxes. Also where is the reward for taking the risk? Would be nice to have a couple of very large financial gains on that street, like a $500k spot and a House Inheritance or something. How about a free scholarship for another degree? 5. Does it matter which spouse you choose if you go down the Marriage road? Are there advantages over one or the other? This isn't explained, unless there are no special advantages of one over another (there should be if there are not). I guess same thought on kids, are there advantages to having kids? If yes, what are they? 6. I would like to be able to pay back debt when I get paid my salary, that would be a nice ""pause"" option when cruising over a paycheck collection space. 7. It's nice having two career choices after completing an education purchase but we always take the higher paying job, why would we choose the other one? THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME GAME!!!
