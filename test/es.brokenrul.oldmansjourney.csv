The music is relaxing and the art is beautiful. As for the reasons I'm not giving it 5 stars...   -In the town at the beginning, I played through it and then it immediately reset (I don't mean the entire game however) when I was finished looking at the beautiful art. It was frustrating to play through the town twice and I'm unsure how common this issue is. Don't get me wrong, it's supposed to be a slow paced visual experience from what I get, but it's still less fun to have to replay a section rather than going on to the next.  -The game was slightly boring in my opinion. I appreciate it of course, but wish it would grab my attention better in the beginning. It gets better though the more you play and the more you realize what it is.  -As someone else mentioned, some more player interaction would be great.   Now, for the reasons I'm giving it 4 stars-  -I can't go without saying again how beautiful the art is. The animation is also silky smooth for the most part.  -It's a relaxing game.

And a little more varied. but I think the price was fair considering the environments & music. It works very very well together for mood & memories. You get that.

I like the surprises.   ‚Ä¢4th wall environmental humor - I really enjoyed the waterfalls, boats very very clever. As I explore the levels .  ‚Ä¢Perhaps teamwork levels. 2 characters or complex gadgets .. working in tandem to solve related goals      ‚Ä¢Push those malleable environments to new limits ""making the wind blow"" ""setting the Sun"". ""Moving the moon Raising the Ocean"" . ""Pushing Snow off mountains or causing avalanches"". ""Sliding back and forth thru the seasons or time..causing lakes to freeze. ""Shaking fruit off trees to attract critters""  I think you guys could make truly unique puzzles. In spectacular or ordinary environments like kitchens and restaurants..
