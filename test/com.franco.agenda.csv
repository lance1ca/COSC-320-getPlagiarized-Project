Much more visually appealing than Google's widgets. The agenda view is just what I've wanted my calendar. My only issue is that it shows events for the previous day. For example I have an all-day event today Fri Feb 23 and it shows but it says Thur Feb 22.  Same for an event next Thur it shows as Wed.,4,3,1.0.2,2018-02-23 06:59:19,Hi Marty.
