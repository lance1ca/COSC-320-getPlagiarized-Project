If you're looking for an app to reference the schedules outlined in the book in mobile format this app meets that need in an easy to use way. The app does not replace the books so do make sure to read them to understand the context. If you only need the schedules and some tips and tricks this app is great!",5,2,2.4.75,2020-07-14 17:56:06,,

It's intended as a complement to the book, and the mothers who say they can just Google the MOC schedules are either lazy or stupid. This app does what it is supposed to, which is give easy reference to schedules and tips for the MOC routines.
