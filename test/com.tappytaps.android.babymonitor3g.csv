I use it between my iPad and Android phone. The connection works well, I love that you can download your own lullabies and control them from the parent station.

It works seamlessly between Apple and Android devices.  We love it, but after using it for over a year, I have found a few things to be aware of: -Be close to a power source. This thing will DRAIN your mobile battery.  I installed the app on my Mac to save my cell battery the abuse.  -Make sure you have reliable Wi-Fi. The monitor only works when connected to the internet and we've had a few cases where we lost connection and woke up to the baby screaming from down the hall (poor kid!) -I JUST learned this today and it's what prompted me to write the review- THE APP SAVES ALL ACTIVITY!  Every time you start monitoring it records every noise made and saves it to your devices memory.  There is no auto-delete setting. I found this because my phone mysteriously ran out of memory and I found 2 GB of it was used by EVERY SINGLE SOUND the baby made on the monitor over the last year.  Devs, if you're reading this , PLEASE patch with a ""delete activity log after __ days"" setting!  If you don't mind dealing with this sort of stuff, this is a great app substitute for traditional monitors. We love running the Parent Station on multiple devices, being able to check in when we leave him with a sitter, or keeping it running if we're working outside while the baby naps.",4,1,4.8.4,2018-01-16 15:37:19,"We're reading this, Tim. :) Thank you for your review and your inputs.

Love the ability to have multiple parent stations, especially for parents at work.  Of course it doesn't have infra red night viewing or temperature monitoring but that means I just need to buy a cheaper dedicated monitor with one parent station for the bedroom so this has really saved us lots of money.  Of course a few improvements are possible - when you use the mic to talk to the baby the feedback makes a scary squelchy noise. Need to filter out the feedback or make it like a 2 way CB radio where when you press the mic to talk, it cuts out the mic on the baby end.  Second, showing the number of parent stations connected on the baby monitor is useless, once it's set up with the screen facing the wall you never check it. You need to be able to see on the parent station how many other parent stations are monitoring.  Third, is it a limitation of android that the camera will not work with the screen off?  I haven't tried yet but I can't see that you can have multiple baby stations and connect to them in rotation or split screen without manually disconnecting and connecting to each?  And can you rename the devices instead of SC1234 to nursery, lounge, mum, dad, etc?  Oh and finally, seems you can monitor from a Mac but not a PC? Would love to be able to have a window open on the office pc to watch, most businesses don't have Macs. Please make a Windows 10 metro app or chrome extension. Also a chrome cast app would be wonderful.

It might be caused by holding the camera button for too long. It'll change it into photo camera and snap a picture. 

If it was the case of frozen video, you'd see notification.

Unlike what the one star review that David Kirton wrote, my experience is that the app WILL work on wifi only. Absolutely no trouble at all.  Video support for android is coming ""this summer"" according to the developer, but I hope to purchased the iOS and mac apps as well in any case. Even without live video on android, the camera function is excellent and just as good. When the baby wakes up, we can just snap a picture or two - there is even a function to control flash (default is flash off). The microphone sensitivity options are great: very high, high, medium, low, very low. The fact that you can add your baby's name to the device and personalize the colors blue/pink make the app great for multiple kids and devices. There are no extraneous features and you only have to pay once. Connection seems rock solid - I have not tried on cellular yet, but so far everything works really well.
