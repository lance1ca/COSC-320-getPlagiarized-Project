difficulties with beginnings due to the amount of new information but this 
game bombards me with options and information that I really don't care 
about. None of the characters, including mine, are likeable. At least not 
as far as I've been reading this. No... I've been trying to read it, 
because every time I do I have to put if away till later. The story isn't 
engaging and it seems to me like it's all about learning new worlds and 
cultures and all those boring nuances. I really don't care if the main 
character dies ion the next page. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",1,2,1.0.7,2018-05-30 03:22:55,,

But then I decided to play it again from the beginning and then the story clicked with me! I loved the lore and atmosphere of the game and I hardly ever got confused once I understood the setting of the game. I LOVE this game now and it's definitely in my top 5 Choice of Games games. I love this author's work and was waiting for another project by him ever since the Heroes Rise Trilogy. VERSUS: The Lost Ones is an amazing game with great story and characters I would definitely recommend this to all my friends. My rating of the game would be 5/5. For those who played Heroes Rise they'll feel that it had a more movie like experience while VERSUS is more of a TV Series.
