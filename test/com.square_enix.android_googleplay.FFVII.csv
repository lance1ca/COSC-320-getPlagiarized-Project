limit break thing happens way too much and it's annoying because you have 
to try to get hurt in order to do a limit break. People complained about 
you needing to get hurt in ff2. The battle system is not really unique 
other than the limit break and this game obviously wasn't meant to be 
ported to an Android. The music is good but it doesn't play well from a 
phone. It takes up way too much space and crashes randomly losing progress 
while you play. It's also really slow in the overworld. It takes up more 
space than all the first six final fantasys combined. The main character

Hell, the other night after the update, I was like ""Word! Let's do the North Cave!"" Did some grinding, and about 45 minutes into it... CRASH. I was done. Haven't touched it since.

Not digital. Mideal cut scene is almost impossible too finish... You certainly can't read and enjoy the shorty again.

Could be wide screen but thats fine. The controls are easy to get used to and there is nothing missing from the old game.  The only thing that lets it down is playing on the 7 edge it crashes every so often. I have to make sure when grinding that you are near a save point and have to save regularly. Atm im stuck im stuck in Cosmos Cavern because the area is too long between saves and it crashes before i can complete it having to start again.  If this can be fixed and it becomes stable i will happily boost my score from 3 to 5 stars,3,0,1.0.27,2018-01-03 11:18:57,,

The app crashes every 25 minutes which isn't ideal if you're playing through a long mission in between saves and finally this has been noted a the vast number of reviews but it looks like Square Enix are making zero effort to resolve it.

On a mobile platform you can't expect any player to be able to get between one save point and another without interruption like let's say a phone call. Change the save system to be more like the previous ports on Android and I would say this is a five-star representation of the original.  Update - It also does not work with android TV.

The only ones rating it 1 star literally never played this game on Playstation before. They probably hate the fact that theres no mini maps to tell you where to go but thats how this game was you can press S1 in game and i will show you where you are and the red points are doors or paths leading to other areas the green ones are ladders that stay in that area. Was definitely worth the price. The controls can be changed if you prefer the analog or directional buttons at the bottom of the screen theres two options one turns off encounters the other says A hit the A and the D for directional buttons shows up also can go to the config in the menu to change the layout of the buttons themselves. Its definitely worth 5 stars the only problem i have with it is after one hour of play it always crashes every hour this could just be a problem i have so don't expect to have it if you buy the game but its definitely something i hope they fix soon cause this isn't a game you play for one hour this is the type of game you sit and play all day long,5,0,1.0.27,2017-09-21 09:24:08,,

The graphics shouldn't be rated down since the game was released in 1997. As for controls, the virtual analog is a great thing, but the d-pad in battle is a bit rough - if playing hastily, you may accidentally use the change or defend commands. I don't know how I feel about the added 'max stats' option or the ability to turn random encounters on and off. What is really worth noting is that this app is in serious need of some bug fixes as it crashes every 10 to 20 minutes or so (hence the low rating scores). This wasn't too much of an issue since I just saved constantly - some parts of the game were a little annoying to get through because of this issue. Even so, it won't stop 100% completion of the game.  This would be very close to a five star app if the crashing issue were to be resolved.",2,2,1.0.27,2017-09-20 08:26:47,,

Probably one of the best games ever made. This app though is absolutely horrible. I have few times been disappointed with square but this one is definitely the worse app I have ever downloaded. Game was working fine until I got to Junon and that's when the constant crashing started. Managed to make it all the way to Cosmo Canyon but now I can't take it anymore. If I could get a refund now I would. But uninstalling anyhow. Oh and when you have a feature like autosave and all gamers know what autosave is and what it does. I don't think you should be allowed (legally) to say you have an autosave feature (which enticed me to buy the game after reading the comments from others about crashing I thought well I can put up with crashes as long as it has autosave) when autosave is non existent and does not do what autosave implies. Absolutely the worst app ever and will not be purchasing Final Fantasy 9. 0 stars out of 5 you don't even deserve 1 star for this app it is garbage and a cash grab.,1,1,1.0.27,2017-08-25 18:25:00,,

A fan since the Playstation. Have played several Emulators since and loved them all. This would be great except the fact that the game crashes consistently. I am on the most current Android with an S8. I am not sure how they ported the game but it ruins the experience when you have to redo the same portion of a mission several times over just to get to a save point. It ruins any motivation to explore the extra optional content because you end up doing it once and the game crashes before you can save any progress.

I recently purchased the FF7 port and was enjoying playing on my Motorola Droid Z Force when suddenly I encountered the crash issues reported by other users. I've noticed you were quick to resolve other issues with this so if you could please address this for me I would be most grateful.  Owned a copy for the PS2 back in the day but due to it being damaged beyond repair I Sowas never able to beat it.😞 So you can see my astonishment and glee when I saw it in the Google play store.
