I will list a couple of things I would like to see in later updates. 1. multiplayer, I would like it if you could play with a friend if they had it on their mobile device, and they could mix with their characters. 2. it would be really cool if they added a couple of bosses in this game, we could have a separate mode for bosses like ""boss mode"" or something like that. 3. I would like more customization with our characters, and maybe we could find exclusive things as we play the game, and just be able to find different customization in shops while we're looting. 4. I would like to be able to craft and make new weapons by combining different weapons, it would be cool to be able to see in your own car too and be able to customize things inside, maybe you could find posters and stuff to put in your car while you're looting. maybe we could also make food by combining food but it would make us more full. I see all the updates you guys do and I really like that you're very active on this game too, which is something I like about this game too. so these were some of my ideas, thanks for reading this review, and just think about my recommendations and see if they'd be a good idea. I also don't get why this game isn't more popular it's just so good. so please just think about my ideas and that would be great:D I also have another thing so this is an edit: I wish choices mattered more. so for example one could be that you turned down someone and didn't accept them into the group, then maybe later in the game they would have a whole team of bandits and you would have to fight them. so that would make the choices matter more and it would be a more memorable story with making memorable friends and enemies, it would be cool too if sometimes there would be bandits while you're looting stuff too, so it wouldn't be just zombies. edit: also minigames would be cool, and so would sidequests that occur between other people from outside your group and sidequests from within your group members. keep up the great work guys.",5,51,1.4.1,2018-11-23 13:34:34,,

It has a good 
plot, lots of events, and even great gameplay. Great game if somebody want 
to play for a few minute, or hours since it can save by exiting out of the 
game. With that being said, there is only a few complaints I have. Movement 
may not function correctly, which is to be expected on a touch screen 
device. Can crash in huge areas, but the game does save before it ocuures. 
Lag will occur if anybody is playing on a old or cheap phone, especially if 
there is lots of zombies. Of course, other platforms like PC and Nintendo 
Switch fix these problems and have extra content. So in other words, 
besides of a few cons, this game is wonderful of being a orgian trail and

Tips for beginners: - ALWAYS be looting - The game jokes about chairs and furniture being useful; they actually are your best weapons! - You can get a lot of zombo points right of the bat by talking to the chicken in the unlocks section. Use these to get some early upgrades to custom characters (NOTE: Initially you can only carry 10 zombo points at once, and if you talk to the chicken when your points are full you'll get NOTHING) - Open all the toilets you can. The 1 gas you get from them seems silly, but something absolutely magical happens when you open enough of them.",5,2,1.0.4,2017-11-17 23:49:25,,
