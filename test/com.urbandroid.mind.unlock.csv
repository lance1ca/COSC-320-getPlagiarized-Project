I submitted the issue and Petr, the developer (or at least one of them), replied right away (even offered me a refund since he couldn't fix it right away). He really came through though, went to a store to borrow a device so he could fix the issue for other Mindroid users that were experiencing these problems. I received a personal update from him this morning and I tested the software on my samsung S4 (GT-I9505), since he only had the HTC one to work with. Problem solved!   Software in general works great for me, be sure to read the info before using it (click ""About"" in the app). I didn't at first and for example the lights aren't meant to be looked at directly, but through closed eyelids.
