The flexibility to create a fully customized chain of steps is fantastic. One request would be to have it pop up a message that it can't find a valid time for a given combination of developer + film. As it is, the app sits there, showing you a blank timer, and refusing to allow you to save as a favorite, with no explanation. Worse, if you rearrange the process to add a pre-soak step before the main timer (which is great that you can!), then the developer timer crashes out leaving you staring at a useless screen while trying to remember how many seconds it's been, and trying desperately to sync up to a digital clock nearby while you switch over to a stopwatch app and try to get it sync'd to the nearest 30 seconds.

It works again now. Previous issue: ""I used to be able to obtain ""projected"" time when I changed the dilution and temperature, e.g. it gave shorter developing time when I change the temperature from 24C to 28C, the results were always acceptable. Now this feature doesn't work. For example, developing Ilford Pan F Plus film using Ilfotec DD-X at 24C gets a 05:00 minutes time but changing the temperature to 28C would get a ~05:00 minutes. Changing developer dilution has similar result.""",5,3,3.56,2018-11-17 06:48:17,Thank you very much for reporting this issue. I've fixed the bug already.,2018-11-17 04:33:20
