The app apparently  installed but there was no icon to be found so I could not start it. I  tried again and paid for it with the same result so I unistalled it for a  second time. According to other comments it is a great app and I really  would like to try it. Perhaps the author can explain.  [Edit]  I misunderstood the install procedure and I have rectified that.  The app now works as advertised and Like other posters here I am completely satisfied.  I thank Tossy for his assistance and the app now has a committeduser.,5,7,1.0.0,2018-06-20 20:20:14,"Thank you for trying my app.

Imported all my bookmarks (~1000 in ~100 nested folders) in one go from desktop Firefox using HTML. It worked immediately and faultlessly. The UI is clear and intuitive, though it's a shame there is so much wasted blank space at the top of the screen. Settings are excellent, allowing fine-tuning without being complex. A delight to use, got the pay version the first day. WISHLISTâ–¶â‘  When a file is exported the default filename should be amendable by the user at the point of saving. I currently have to find the file with a file manager after export to rename the file to something meaningful. â‘¡ What would make this app truly great, would be if there was an option to hold the bookmark data on SD (preferably in encrypted form), so it could be synced locally between devices (eg with Syncthing), without having to export/sync/import.
