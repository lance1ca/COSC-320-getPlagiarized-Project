The game runs buttery smooth on my Pixel 2, and, unlike a lot of mobile games these days, my phone doesn't run hotter than a deep fryer while playing - it's actually cool as a cucumber! There are a couple of little issues: The button presses are generally very accurate, but swipe motions are a bit hit-or-miss for some reason. Soup especially has become my nemesis, because you risk swiping right out of the app when cutting the veggies. The game feels a bit crowded on a standard phone in general, since it's made for a full computer screen - it's probably better on an XL 'phablet' and I wouldn't imagine it being an issue at all on a true tablet. Actually, after enjoying the motion controls (for the most part), I think playing on a tablet might be the best way to enjoy the game.
