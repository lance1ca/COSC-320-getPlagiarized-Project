Nice mechanics. Like sounds and music. Found a few glitches, but not a big deal. There it's only one annoying thing: it tries to connect to Google play games every time when starts a new level. I don't use Google play games and this is really annoying. Fixing that causes me to give a 5 stars rating :)",4,0,1.0,2021-01-30 04:34:15,,
