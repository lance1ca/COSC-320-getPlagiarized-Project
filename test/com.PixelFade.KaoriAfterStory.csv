The Ace academy was the breath taking game. I love it very much so I bouht Kaori A.S. but there is one thing that bother me a lot is that you guys don't have the option to mute the characters dialogue anymore.

I'm so glad Kaori is still so fiery and loud like she was in ACE i love it. I also love that she has a secret soft side. A super soft side. For the MC the daycare kids and her family. Its something i never expected her to have. She may be my new favorite character after playing this. I cant say for sure until you guys make these after stories for the other girls in ACE. Please do that. I think more than just me want it,5,11,5,2019-03-20 17:29:41,,
