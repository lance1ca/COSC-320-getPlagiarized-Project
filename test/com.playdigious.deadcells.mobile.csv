This is by far the best game I've played on my mobile, and actually one of the best games I've played, period. The graphics are amazing, smooth, lots of details on everything, each weapon has several different animations when they're used which change constantly. The randomly generated levels, plus the difficulty makes a perfect combination that keeps you hooked. Every run is completely different, each combination of weapons make you play it differently, do you have a strong close quarters weapon, you roll and hit everything... do you have a bow or maybe 2 bows? play it like a 'shooter'... do you have a shield to bounce back everything they throw at you? also each melee weapon has different power, reach, speed, every single detail counts. I'm about 70hs in and I still can't get to boss cell 2, and I'm enjoying every run SO MUCH. Yeah, as most people said, playing with a controller should be much better, I've got hit or fell into a trap several times due to te screen controls, but overall they're WAY better than most other games. I can't recommend this game enough. It's kinda hard, then you slowly make progress through it and it feels so cool, then you finish it, but that's just the beginning, with the different boss cells!

The game works extremely well with a controller especially with the Razer Kishi where you won't experience any input lag at all, the game also automatically recognizes your controller. The game is really colorful and runs excellent from low end android devices(low settings) to the more high end device with max graphics option like the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The game also doesn't drain battery like most of the Android games available on the Google Play Store. Dead Cells is also HIGHLY REPLAYABLE, because every single time you die or start a new game the dungeon layout completely changes.

However, instead of compensating for this by pressing right, if you press the left thumbstick LEFT, it will negate the drift. This seems like a software-side input issue, which is made worse by the fact that you can rebind all but the movement buttons on this game. The main menu tends to lag for some reason, in particular when going into the settings, a lag that I don't think repeats while heading into the settings in-game. Very odd. Otherwise, it's Dead Cells on mobile. It has autoattack, it runs pretty smooth aside of the above issue and controls about as crisp as you could expect for a game that requires tight controls yet is on mobile. Perhaps if the controller issue gets resolved I could tell you if the controller makes it crisp enough to enable reaction speeds that you'd require on PC. Please fix the controller drift issue OR let us rebind movement buttons so I can unbind the left thumbstick and use the D-pad for movement instead. That'd be great.",3,27,1.1.11,2020-06-04 09:16:54,,

From game play down to music, this game has it all. From the way you progressively level up items with collected cells (in the forge), the trippy 16-bit visuals, the loose story line regarding the island, the boss battles, the strategies, the runes that allow you discover more...
