The GUI is intuitive after a short learning curve and the control I have over everything is expansive yet not overwhelming.  Having only started using DAWs this year I'm at a point now with this app that it can do everything I can dream up and more.  One of the draw-backs (and this is down to personal preference) is the pattern-based work flow isn't the ideal way for me to plan and organize a piece of work.  There is a lot of flexibility within each pattern to create crazy time signatures (which is a huge plus compared to the competition) but I need to visualize a song as a whole to really get it structured properly.  There are other apps out there which are organized differently (FL Studio for example) and I prefer that setup but I always come back to G-Stomper because it's just so much more flexible and awesome in every other way that I'm learning to work around my personal preferences.    If you want to compose music with a great DAW on android this is the app to get.,5,2,5.4.2.1,2017-04-28 08:15:08,"Thank you very much, Tim, for your detailed review.

First, I am using a Samsung T800 10.5"" and this tablet easily handles the load. The tablet screen adds some latency and I'll deal with that later. As an overall sequencer and sound machine, for the price and the fact that we're using a tab here, this is one of the best that I've seen. The Devs have thought of and packed everything you could need into this app and I think it's a shame that we have to call this just an ""app"". I won't go into details because if you're interested in this app you're serious and knowledgeable enough about the toys included, save to say that there's a bit of a learning curve here but the tools are familiar. I took off a star because as a engineer, and a musician, I reserve the right to get pissy about details. I bought some of the sound packs because, face it, the Devs worked hard enough on the ""studio"", there isn't a whole lot of sounds included. Watch out for the sound packs, while they are cheap, the drum packs, some of them anyway, are rotten old dm mch sounds and very cheap sounding at that. I expected more from the separate sound packs. I'll use my own from now on. So! Four stars for one of the best andriod seq/samplrs",4,10,5.0.3,2016-03-18 18:05:32,"Thank you very much for your detailed review, Dave.

Took me a min to figure out how to step edit but well worth it for some of the the great synth sounds you can get. My only complaints is that there are a lot of sounds that are almost to weird to use and it seems like you need a powerful tablet in order for it to run smoothly especially when you have all 16 patterns full of stuff. I have an HP touch pad and gstomper is always closing on me and since using a tablet for an app like this is essential I now need to find one that can keep up.

Not only do I use it for drum beats but also for melodies, great app to mix up samples to create unique sounds.  I have two new ideas:   1. Auto save feature, a temp file created at shutdown of the app. Then at next startup it should check for the temp file and ask if you want it loaded.  2. When changing the note, I noticed that the notes after the one you change, become the same note. Though I have not read the entire manual, and I could be missing something.
