The music is so depressing and the transitions are so blunt and disjointed. I can't meditate with this new version. ------------- Great app, it really has helped me with my breath. At first, I thought it was a bit hokey but with time and practice, it really was powerful. I wish, however, that there was the ability to add more than a single reminder notification each day.",1,4,3.1,2021-02-01 08:56:37,,

the sound you get on a cassette tape or poorly ripped compilation cd when
