(The Cottonwoods and surrounding drainages.) I have not had issues with the navigation dot and I use it often while out on tours to confirm location. Accurate in the field and that's all I'm asking it for. Works with the phone in airplane mode as well.,5,4,4.0.0,2020-03-13 18:21:35,,

This app is for a very specific area, and pricey for such a small area. When I tried to use this near Ogden, looking at the Wasatch Mountains, it tells me my location is off map. It does work in portrait, which was mentioned as a problem in other reviews, and the maps are blurry unless zoomed in. Cover the Wasatch front and use a zoom friendly map and this may be good.",1,5,,2019-10-06 18:42:24,,

I did have to manually give the app permissions. Would be cool if you could pin and save locations. Or I haven't figured out how to save them.,4,2,3.1.0,2018-03-06 12:52:54,"Thanks, Casey. Some newer Android devices require you to enable location permissions--glad you figured it out! I've decided, rightly or wrongly, to not save locations, tracks, etc. However, you can drop a pin at any location by tapping and holding (e.g., to email or navigate to that point). There are several good GPS-like apps (e.g., MotionX GPS).",2018-03-06 13:12:33

Best BC ski app around. Unfortunately I must provide the feedback that the app is not working for location. The recent update for Android has rendered it nearly useless for any sort of gps antenna navigation. I spoke with Google about it and they recommended getting in touch with the developer. Google says they informed developers about most recent changes to Android OS. Thanks,1,2,3.1.0,2018-03-05 12:35:49,"Unfortunately, we can't contact you when you leave a review.
