It's American sign language which is different from what I am teaching my son. It says in the description that there's an option to select BSL when you start the app but there is not and I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and no joy. I've also emailed for support 2 weeks ago and had no response.,1,0,1.1,2021-01-10 07:02:55,,

He loves it even more now but I wish the songs were longer. Most of them are shorter than 30 seconds and it's not very kid friendly to replay the song or to select a new one. The longest song is the one you already get for free. That being said I would definitely recommend this app to others.
