It is perfect for my 4 years old. At first I downleaded the free version and decided to do the in app purchase but was I was disappointed because i could not share the app to my family library to intall it on all devices. I contacted RosiMosi and they offered to refund and buy directly 5.49$ version instead. Which solved the problem. Awesome customer service!!,5,5,5.1,2020-04-26 12:32:33,,
