Then it connected and seemed to work great for a minute or two. I had already read the reviews about changing the setting to make sure my phone screen stays on, so no issues there, but suddenly all my slides (in preview on the phone) changed from my graphics to the ProPresenter Logo. No way out, so I closed the app. When I re-opened it, it had not remembered the settings, so I once again had to do a manual setup. Same deal...worked for a little while and then stopped. I have tried clearing the app cache, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, have triple-checked the settings on both my PC and the app. The app is both completely unusable, and unable to store connection settings...
