I have a collection of 180 strereo still photographs (side-by-side). To view them I have to search for and select one (it won't play all the files in a directory). Then switch to stereo (3D), then switch to ""Dome"" projection. That's about five steps and requires that I take the phone out of the viewer. To see the next photo I have to repeat THE WHOLE PROCESS.

I mean, it's like having an IMAX screen strapped to your head.  However, it needs some work.  There needs to be a few more features controllable by a gamepad/external keyboard, specifically the option to pass through the camera.  This feature is useless on a Google cardboard or similar because you have to touch the screen to use it...meaning you've taken the phone out anyway.    Since you can access the menu with a controller, you need to be able to see it when you have the player on with a headset.  There should be an option to bring up the menu in the 3D world similar to the video.  Also, all of the settings should be alterable with a controller, some aren't.  There needs to be a help feature (or even just an online wiki).  Most settings have no explanation (such as orientation provider) and a help file to explain them would be great.  There could also be some simple integration with the magnetic ""button"" on a Cardboard headset, such as calibrate when clicked.  The calibration is the thing that an average user would most use with the headset on, and it would be handy if you could do it with the magnet button.",4,2,1.8.1,2015-01-30 22:38:56,,

The interface leaves a bit to be desired for use in Cardboard or Dodocase but it's mostly workable as long as you don't mind repeatedly pulling the phone out of the case to make adjustments.  The biggest issue is the double-tap to calibrate: because the phone is secured by a piece of cardboard bridging the nose and pressing against the screen, moving one's head during a video tends to trigger re-calibration, completely screwing up playback. I would strongly recommend limiting the double-tap to the center of the playback image (or the center of each of the left and right panes in split mode) so that pressure from the case doesn't trigger an accidental calibration.",4,0,1.7.2,2014-11-26 09:02:50,,
