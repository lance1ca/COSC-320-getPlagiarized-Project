It would be great if it includes audio on/off and play/pause button for audio files as currently i have to tap in the menu and goes favourite and play which requires 3 taps to get a file to play. It would be quite a hassle if i need a few items to be play in a fast manner. However, this is definitely a great app. If we could have a thumbnail on each scene that would be even better! But this of course is not that of a priority.",5,1,1.0.5,2020-11-26 20:13:41,"Thanks for the suggestion. I'll look into adding those features. I want the thumbnail feature for myself especially; however, the vMix api doesn't support it. I'll reach out to the developers for that feature too.",2021-01-14 08:46:43
