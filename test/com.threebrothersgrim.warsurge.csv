The price point was a little high, especially with out knowing what separates it, from other like apps. I have spent more on a single commander MTG deck. This app is phenomenal, in its ability to create, whatever type of army, miniature, or Character. (Personally, I have been working on space bugs that are grim and dark). I highly recommend this app",5,0,1.0.27,2021-01-28 19:46:20,,

I know some are obvious but some are difficult to determine on what to label them as.,4,1,1.0.27,2020-12-24 19:20:34,"Hi Jordan, the symbols are mentioned in our how to play videos, but for a quick explanation, they are purely for your reference and personalization. Although some symbols are more obvious than others, many are up for interpretation to the player. Ultimately, they can also help you find your units and weapons quicker in lists.",2020-12-27 19:22:41

Spectacularly great gameplay experience, fully customizable profiles, that QR scanner for lists and the in-app dice rollers are absolute godsends.

Plethora of design options and choices to really customize your force and make rules for ""your dudes"" decent polish on the overall all UI and app design. With unlimited design of your forces comes a double edged sword is that you have to input alot of data and pick every stat for every type of unit can be alot of intial work for someone trying to jump in. Now that i have built a soild library of units and weapons its quick but intial entry can be a chore.",4,1,1.0.23,2020-12-13 16:52:20,"Thanks for the review!
