Many less false positives. I didnt hear any random shots like before. A very few shots didnt register, but it was in an acceptable range. Green lazer works great. Keep up the good work.",5,0,2.2.5,2021-02-07 23:07:29,"Thanks for the review Paco. I'm always trying to improve our apps and I have an update coming in really soon that should help with some of the false positives cross device, as I'm experimenting with adding support for auto adjusting white balance and exposure, as well as adding usability updates to make configuration even easier.",2020-12-09 07:50:05

He took a look at a video of my issue and says he's working on what seems to be a novel bug. My issue is that the camera polling rate seems to be too slow. Edit 2: within less than 24 hours, the developer is pushing out a bug patch. I'm very excited to see the result!",5,0,2.2.0,2021-02-04 14:04:32,"CRACKSHOT supports lasers with up to 50ms in pulse duration (which is visible by both 30 and 60 fps). Our app supports at least a 16.6ms on most devices. Most lasers including CRACKSHOT are at least 50ms, with the exception of LaserHIT brand which has a 1ms pulse duration. Our list of supported lasers is available on our app store page.",2021-02-04 03:31:14

Adjusting the light can help because in bright areas, the phone can go into a bright light mode which causes the laser to look ""white"" instead of red. We do handle this in app, but results vary by phone phone. For this reason, detection works when targets are out of direct sunlight.",2021-02-04 03:40:39

It marked hits nowhere close to where they showed up on paper. If there is any shadows or movements it records hit. Hopefully with some development it will be better,2,1,2.2.0,2020-12-27 14:02:54,"Hi James, Thank you for trying out our app. CRACKSHOT is uses changes in lighting to determine where hits are generated. As such, it works best with interior rooms, as external lighting (say from a window with shadows outside) will cause false positives. Try moving your targets to an interior wall and close your window blinds. Thanks!",2020-12-30 04:31:32
