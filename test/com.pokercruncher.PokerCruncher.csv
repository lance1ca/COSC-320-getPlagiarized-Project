I just realized that there is probably an existing simple solution for this - If your phone's screen is larger than normal, when this app is running the phone's system bar should have an additional ""full screen"" icon (has 4 outward-pointing arrows). Tapping this icon button should resize/zoom the app to fit the screen well.

From your description (""not licensed"") this looks to have nothing to do with Samsung tablets in general, but happened probably because on your Samsung tablet you didn't log in/add your Google id/account on the tablet (under Settings).  So on your tablet the app thought you hadn't purchased the app.  Glad everything's fine on your HTC phone.
