I highly recommend you to add a feature wherein user may see the percentage (%) of voice match with atleast top 10 persons gps-wise i.e. geographically near & ofcourse must include top 5 know personality as of now. You may also include facematch in upcoming updates. You may add intensity(dB) with frequency (Hz). Please upgrade as soon as you get time to work on your pioneer phd project.
