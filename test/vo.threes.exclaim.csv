I normally dont like gaming on my phone but this game changed that opinion. The game is gorgeous with a really cute art style. It has the perfect aesthetic for a mobile game that doesnt require a powerful phone and doesnt drain battery. The gameplay is perfect for quick pickup and play when you have a couple minutes free. The soundtrack is from a composer that worked on Mass Effect 2 and it shows because it really is excellent. Totally worth 6 bucks.,5,4,1.3.96,2019-10-23 22:43:00,,

While you have control over what side of the screen the next piece will appear, you cannot control its location. As a result, once I got the rules down, the vast majority of games end due to bad luck, rather than poor strategy or decisions. There is nothing you can do to reliably progress further in the game because a perfect strategy can be killed swiftly by RNG. There are some bugs - I got a new high score that did not register on the stat tracking, despite unlocking an achievement - and UI problems as well.

great game! However, for some reason sync with Google play games stopped 
working. Clearing caches of both apps, reinstalling, nothing helped. 
Doesn't make the game any less brilliant and sync is luckily not necessary 
for this type of game, still would love the achievements to be tracked. 
Edit (after dev reply): I am logged in to both devices and other games seem 
to be working fine. I am also pretty sure that I'm not in ART-mode (?) 
right now, at least I didn't actively change it and don't think android did 
that on its own? This is such a tiny issue for me, though, that I really 
don't mind and think it's a one-in-a-million ""problem"".",5,0,1.3.6,2018-08-02 08:44:43,"Hi Gaston - Thanks for your feedback, sorry to hear you're having syncing issues. Are you logged in to G+ on both devices? We recently removed G+ auto-login due to some ART conflicts, so it's possible that you simply aren't logged in on your second device. Email us at threes@hiddenvariable.com if you have other issues and we'll look into it!",2014-06-06 10:58:05

The game will automatically detect the language your phone is in, so if you change that language on your phone, it should also change the language in the game. Please e-mail us at threes@hiddenvariable.com for other questions.

Note: after update mentioned by dev, app does run better, but it still sends me to tweet my score at times, without ever having pressed the button to tweet. Please just add an option to disable this!  No third party app, just the Twitter app. What happens is when a game ends, I swipe at the bottom of the screen to save my score (nowhere near the Twitter icon) and randomly, the screen goes white, and then the tweet screen comes up.

Unfortunately, the game closes when using G+ sign on due to ART. Along with many other Unity-based apps, we don't currently support ART. That said, we hope to do so in the near future! In the meantime, you can always run the game using Dalvik as your default runtime.

Unfortunately, the game closes when using G+ sign on due to ART. Along with many other Unity-based apps, we don't currently support ART. That said, we hope to do so in the near future! In the meantime, you can always run the game using Dalvik as your default runtime.

Thanks for the kind words! We are working hard to optimize the game further to improve the battery life. That said, the game is developed using Unity and Unity games tend to require a lot of battery life. However, we will do our best!

It should let you share them using the standard Android intents system - it insists that you manually 'sign' your high scores even though it already knows your name from Play Games - it's hard coded Twitter integrations that don't really make sense in a world where Twitter isn't part of the operating system.,3,0,1.0.3,2014-04-02 06:00:40,"Hi Ade, thanks for the review and feedback.

The game itself is fantastic and very endearing and once you get the hang of it things can get pretty carried away!  But because I play this mostly on my commute to and from work there is lack of cellular service within the subway system.  This in part is very deterring when you start up the game (with no cellular signal) and the app persistently spams to login to your Google account. Every single time.  In turn if you have multiple Gmail accounts you always have to select the one you generally associate your achievements with.  Once you're in the fun begins.  If you happen to achieve a new score or high card while no celluar service is available, your achievements and scores are not registered to your account.  Once I surface from the subway and attempt to access the leaderboard or even logout and log back into my Gmail account within the Threes apps, it never registers or picks up my achievements or scores.  I tried shutting down the app and restarting it but to no avail.  Sometimes my highest score while obtained with no cellular service disappears, as if I never obtained it",1,8,1.0.3,2014-03-21 05:31:44,"Hi Dan, we weren't able to reproduce this issue on our internal devices.
