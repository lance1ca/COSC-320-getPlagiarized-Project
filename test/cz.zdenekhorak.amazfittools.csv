This app worked really well for my BIP, but the claim that Amazfit GTS/GTR is fully supported is misleading. The main issue is that notifications pushed by Tools&Amazfit are truncated, sending only about 150 characters out of 240 maximum notification description. The Amazfit app pushes the entire text, so it's clearly not a watch issue, but it doesn't support transliteration and Gmail notification content, only subject. Depending on how you use your watch this can be a serious issue, since my main usage scenario is for notifications when in meetings. Honestly I've bought the GTS solely on the claim that Tools&Amazfit supports it and for the larger screen and extra text. There are also other issues regarding the claim of complete support, for example the GTS firmware has a lot more app icons than the ones available in Tools & Amazfit.

Show text *new* without vibration *new*  With this combo, we can be noticed with just 1 vibration, not 2 (showing icon) plus another one (showing text). Tested a day with only custom vibration set at 1, and my band battery live increased a lot.  We can actually configure vibration times in 'custom vibration' option, but not in 'vibration and text' one.  We can not only send text without vibration (idk if it's possible).
