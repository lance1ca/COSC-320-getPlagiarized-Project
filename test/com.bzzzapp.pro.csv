The simplicity of this app makes it stand out among all others. Custom vibration patterns help me tell the reminders apart from emails etc when phone is in pocket. This is especially helpful when you like to have phone silent for most of your day. Simplicity of this app coupled with the custom vibration patterns makes this app the best one on the playstore for people who don't want to take phone out of pocket too often.,5,0,3.1.2,2021-02-08 11:47:56,Thank you very much for your 5-star review!!!,2021-02-08 05:59:49
