I don't know about everyone else but this homeschool mama doesn't have money to buy all the kids new tablets so they can have this app.  The concept is great. I like that we won't run out of letters if we want to build multiple words.  It's nice that we don't have to worry about losing tiles and with one swipe all the letters are back where they need to be! And so portable if we want to take it on the go. There are things that would make this app great. The first you have already somewhat fixed--making words easier to divide (for me. It's still hard for my 10 year old. He has epilepsy and can only use one hand and it's hard to divide words with one hand.). But it would be nice if there was an easier way to put the syllables back together to make the big word without moving each individual tile again.  And it would be awesome if there was a way for the app to read the words or individual syllables. I know this isn't a crazy concept--leapfrog can do it with their fridge phonics word builder toy.  Overall, the app is okay. I don't think it was worth paying the sale price of $15.",3,5,"1,2",2018-03-06 10:15:52,"Thanks, Erin! We’ll continue to look at syllable division. To put words back together, you can 2 finger drag on words or word parts. We don't plan to have the app sound out words--the student should sound out the words with a parent or teacher to analyze any mistakes. Simply reading a word for a child doesn't help them know why they were wrong.",2018-03-09 09:02:50
