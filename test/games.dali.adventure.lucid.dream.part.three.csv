It is ONE game so why has it been broken into separate games? I would have given 5 stars had it not been for that. You need to join the chapters into one game (per other comments) - the player's concentration / enjoyment (mine) is interrupted! Just curious - why do it this way?

If we would exceed the size, I would need to add server and have costs that we cant have at the moment.
