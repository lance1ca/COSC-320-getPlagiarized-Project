However, there a few too many bugs that need to be fixed. 1) Podcasts will randomly pause playback. Hitting play will start it again, but it rewinds back and replays some of what you've already heard. This can fix playback for a little awhile, but it will pause again after a random number of minutes. 2) Downloads/Updating never stops. Once you open the app, it will begin to check for updates and download new episodes. Once complete, the notification will remain and never finish. 3) The Pause/Play button on the notification drop down and on the lock screen will only display a pause button after the app has been running for awhile. It will still do both pause and play actions, but it will always appear as a pause button. Annoying bugs when you're using an app you paid for.",3,1,1.2.4153,2018-10-19 05:43:31,,

The app randomly pauses/stops playing and needs a force restart. This usually happens after about 30 min of play time. When using Bluetooth if the headphones are connected to two devices it will not play even after force closing the app. The only fix is to re-pair the headphones. When playing in a car stereo system it will pause the podcast when jumping 30 seconds ahead. These bugs are making the app near unusable. Please test the app on new versions of Android before they release to ensure the app is compatible. If these issues aren't fixed within a month I'll be switching to a more reliable podcast player.,2,1,1.2.4153,2018-10-15 07:42:31,,

First, there's no way to set it so that it streams episodes by default, rather than downloading (streaming requires use of a context menu).  And once it's streaming, it randomly pauses.  This is clearly a known issue, and various forum threads explain it as a problem of other apps requesting audio focus.  Frankly I don't care -- I've used at least two free programs and not encountered this behavior.  Finally, it refuses to stream some episodes with long names and/or unusual characters in their names that play smoothly in the other managers I've used.

You need a CS degree from MIT to know how backup, zip, export the settings out of your old device, re-import back into the new device at the precise location, and hope they take on the new device.  Seriously, I dont know how the average person would even know where to start. For #2:  the default storage location is the  device memory, and on Lollipop it is not possible to just use the SD card.  If you try to move storage to the SD card, the app says all is OK, gives a green sign, but then it fails (it cannot use the SD card) and crashes.

I've been using DoggCatcher for many years now but only because the alternatives are worse.  Near perfect for UI and functionality  It wasn't too hard to figure out how to auto download podcasts and auto play them in more or less the right order.  In contrast other podcast app makers need to go back to user interface junior high.  DC also supports five button headsets.  Surprisingly other apps don't, and if you listen to podcasts in the car and skip programs frequently, three buttons simply isn't enough.  I subtract 0.5 stars here only because like other apps there are too many confusing options.  This is because the base UI still needs work and app makers put knobs everywhere to compensate since its easier than designing it properly.  -1 stars for support  DC has some glaring annoyances.   First it gets confused if two podcasts have the same name (?!?).  Second it randomly starts playing again after disconnecting from Bluetooth.  These have been around a long time and you sometimes get the feeling support doesn't want to hear about things that are hard to fix.

I also wanted to be able to play podcasts from local .mp3 files.  This is the ""virtual feeds"" feature in DoggCatcher.  In general the app looks nice, but I had several problems with virtual feeds.  The podcasts would play in the wrong order and by default the next episode didn't play automatically.  I couldn't quickly find out a way to sort the pod cast order based on mp3 filename.  Also switching between different feeds was confusing (e.g., if I select a feed 'A', play it, then navigate to feed 'B' and hit play again, playback will resume from 'A' and not 'B').  There are probably ways of getting these things done in DoggCatcher but I would expect this type of rather simple functionality to work out of the box without exploring advanced settings in the app.",3,0,1.2.4050,2014-02-09 05:51:51,"The playback order of files is based on the audio playlist, rather than the last feed that you selected (this is different from itunes).

Sadly, Downcast is not available for the Android market.  So I have been trying various podcast apps in hopes to find one that was as easy to use as Downcast, especially while driving.  Unfortunately, Doggcatcher (paid version) is not that app.  On the plus side, it will play podcasts and it has variable speed settings.    Otherwise, its menu settings are more convoluted than intuitive.  It won't display all of an episode's description.  It had a hard time playing the chapters of my audiobook in order.  (Instead of playing ""title 01"", ""title 02"", ""title 03"", Doggcatcher kept trying to play ""title 10"" after each one of those episodes.)  The last straw was when the app last updated and deleted all of my feeds.    Ultimately, the app does not lend itself well to distraction-less driving or frustration-free podcast listening.",2,1,,2014-01-26 10:22:22,,

It has never crashed on me - although it's had trouble downloading one or two episodes before - which I attribute to the podcast website rather than this program.  I agree with another reviewer that a ""favorites"" selection would be nice.  I normally have the settings play one podcast at a time but it would be cool to have the option to play a list (Favorites) of podcasts concurrently at a time of my choosing.  This is the one feature that I miss about the Stitcher app.  But I don't always want all of my podcasts to play at once, just when my hands are tied when I'm doing dishes, building, or painting, etc.  That's my only suggestion.  Otherwise, this app is perfect.",4,0,1.2.4034,2013-10-25 07:30:27,,

What Bluetooth Support?  Exactly.  All you get is play/pause.  No display of the currently playing episode.  No support for ""next"" or cueing.  This is a premium app and it's surprising that support is so poor.

And a way to set the ""auto-delete episodes when they're done"", to leave the most recent episode or two not deleted, so that one has a chance to rewind back into a podcast that has just finished.  Also, I would have liked more detail in documentation; where it says ""User playlists can be configured to automatically add..."" it would be nice to have details like ""view your playlist and tap on the name to get the playlist menu; in this menu, tap on the triangle in the lower corner of your playlist's title to bring up a submenu with 'edit playlist', in which you can configure auto-add"".

I rarely use wi-fi, and only use a power source when the phone needs to be charged. From the time that I changed those settings up until tonight, the phone had not been on a power source, and I had not turned on wi-fi, but when I checked the phone, I found that the app was still downloading feeds.

The UI is very polished, it's decently configurable, it allows me to set priorities on which podcasts I want to listen to first, and best of all it's much more responsive to the buttons on my Bluetooth headset than Listen was. In particular, I can disconnect the headset, then reconnect it, then press play, and it will pick up where it left off.

While Doggcatcher has most of the features I was looking I found it a little frustrating trying to sort the view of downloaded episodes and didn't like the color scheme and lock screen controls. Another issue that I hope the developer considers for the future is to offer a trial version of the app as such apps are hard to evaluate fully within the 15 mins refund grace period. I've been using BeyondPod for the past few days instead (it offers a full featured trial for 7 days) and have just purchased that today and will be using it as my main podcast manager as it addresses the above mentioned issues and has a much better app and lockscreen UI (shows you the full episode information and playback controls with much better looking podcast images when the phone is locked).,3,0,,2012-06-30 23:20:21,,

Navigation is a little clumsy compared to BeyondPod (too many presses of the back button at times) but every thing works smoothly compared to a few hiccups I had with the BeyondPod trial (stuttering of its own internal video player on a GNex).

However, it no longer connects to my bluetooth headset - while everything else on my phone does.  It used to, but a few weeks ago it stopped and I haven't been able to get it to since.      My reason for giving it a one star is the complete lack of support from Doggcatcher.  I went to their site - signed up for their forums and posted my problem.  One user replied and said he thought it must be a problem with Android.  Sorry, but no.  It used to work fine.  And that's the kind of reply developers use when they have absolutely no idea what's wrong with their application.      Most annoyingly though is the fact that they have no setting in the app itself that you can use to tell it to broadcast through the bluetooth headset.  So there is apparently no way at all to fix this problem.      Three days later - still no response from anybody else.
