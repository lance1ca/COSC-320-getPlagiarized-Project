You can also use the app’s reading library and video library to learn more about the disease.  In my case, the app confirmed that my mother’s calcium was too high. The end result was that her health has improved tremendously since Dr. James Norman performed her parathyroid surgery at The Parathyroid Treatment Center at Tampa General Hospital.

A good idea functionally, but a web site would make a ton more sense. That wouldn't make them any money, of course. The company that probably commissioned this --  Norman Parathyroid Center -- has a big web site and could easily have done such an app.  In any case, I think they either (a) used an amateur developer, like somebody's teenage kid who wanted to build a phone app or (b) got ripped off by a ""professional"" developer.  One detail -- they haven't researched  variations on data that users are likely to get from their lab tests. For example, the app expects PTH in ml/dg units, but my lab gave it in mmol/l.  By searching I found that you multiple mmol/l by 4 to get ml/dg, but all the app said was ""some figures are out of range"" -- it didn't tell me which figure, much less offer alternative units  So, if this outfit really wants to help people, as opposed to make a trendy smartphone app, they should invest in a good professional web developer with medical website experience.  They should also say in advance what lab tests to ask your doctor for.",2,18,1.3.2,2014-01-27 10:24:28,,

After I entered the dexa test results, it showed gibberish on the totals page.  I contacted the Norman Parathyroid Center numerous times for help via email and phone calls.  I was told they would look into it and get back to me, but no one did.  I called again and was told to leave a message for the practice manager, which I did.  Still no response.

I couldn't believe how easy it was to put all my data in and find that I am very likely to have a parathyroid adenoma AND osteopenia.  @ Quigley, your numbers don't look like they are abnormal or high compared to mine so that is probably why you are ""unlikely"" to have a tumor.  Anyone who sees a high calcium blood level should be aware of this horrible disease.  If you have lots of kidney stones like I did you should suspect a parathyroid tumor and look at your calcium and PTH levels in your blood.  My doctors saw my high calcium and thought it was just because I was taking supplements.  I am fortunate to find out from this app about the bone damage early enough to reverse it, too.  I suggest this app to everyone!",5,3,1.22,2013-04-04 08:22:45,,

It means they do. It's variable. That helps you make the diagnoses."". Yet, when I entered a year's worth of calcium levels that range from 8.7 to 10 the program said my chances of parathyroid disease if very unlikely. Add to that that I have almost every single symptom of parathyroid disease listed on their website and that I had a parathyroid adenoma removed 10 years, for me their app is extremely disappointing.",1,4,1.10,2013-03-27 10:20:55,,
