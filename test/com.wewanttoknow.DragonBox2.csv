The problem is I don't know what I did to beat it. Starting at about level 6 there should be an instant replay that shows what happened. Also there should always be an option to show the concept learned on each level. I also think it would be cool if I could create something personalized when beating the levels. For example the opportunity to upload a personal picture and be creating a collage as I go. Thanks. God bless. Aaron",3,1,2.0.6,2014-01-04 17:27:44,,
