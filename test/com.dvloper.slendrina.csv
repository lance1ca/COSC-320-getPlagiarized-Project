It's great that she jumps out at you - nice touch! My only concern is that now ALL the scares seem to come from those random pop ups... There's no fear in turning around to see if she's followed you like in Slender Rise Again, which makes it less tense and less creepy. I found the pop ups made me jump less the more I played and the fear of being followed would help change that. A balance would earn this game 5 stars from me!",4,58,1.8.1,2014-03-19 03:01:10,,

The only things I think should be changed (which I know you probably already thought of) is some sort of animation to slendrina, and a screaming sound when she see's you.",5,42,1.8,2014-02-13 22:53:18,"Hello.
Thank you so much. I am very glad that you like Slendrina. Yes i have thought about an animation on her, but im not sure yet. And a scream sound is a good idea.

She made me jump on the first level ( the only one I've played so far), so that says something. Good job. Edit: really enjoying. One of the few slender games where you can loose. She will sometimes pop up right in front of you. Sick of all these slender games where slender is just annoyance. Good job!",5,41,1.5,2013-11-14 20:26:20,"Thank you! Glad you like it.
