Terribly balanced, offline progress limited by arbitrary caps on resources, nonsensical prestige mechanics, updates just fiddle around with the ridiculous item system and fix bugs created by previous update. I muddled along mostly to stave off my buyer's remorse until an update rendered my save unplayable.",1,6,0.9.8.0,2020-10-17 02:07:04,"Sorry to hear you are unsatisfied! I haven't seen this issue where a save is unplayable - for safety, the game keeps multiple backups of your save file, and falls back to one if a save corrupted. I am a solo developer shipping updates as fast as you can. If you want help recovering your save, I am happy to try to help, I am at corfe83@gmail.com.",2020-10-30 10:54:22

There are too many upgrade options, and it's not clear what they all do. I actually got better results just randomly upgrading things than trying to be strategic. The whole upgrade system needs streamlined. And I would be more engaged if I had some way to effect the battle, like being able to select the targeted ship. Things like the the welder feast should be one-time use that give your ships a boost for a few seconds. Maybe be able to stack them within reason.",3,4,0.9.2.0,2020-09-05 05:41:28,,
