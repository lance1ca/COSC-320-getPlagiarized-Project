The quests were entertaining, the puzzles and HOG scenes were unique and the quality of the graphics were absolutely amazing.

(Fortunately my tablets are backed up twice a day, so I could easily rollback to where I was any previous day) Sometimes you do, or see something, and would like to 'rewind' and do it again. I guess what I mean, is that each user should be allowed to save their progress periodically into one of many 'save game slots'. Or at least let us jump back to any chapter we have done.
