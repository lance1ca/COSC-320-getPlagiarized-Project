Good points: 1. Design & Graphics 2. Animation 3. Features like researching technologies and super weapons Bad points (and sorry to day these are deal breakers): There seem to be many bugs in the game 1. Sometimes when the last enemy is defeated the game freezes. And even if you restart, you can't finish as you are the only one left. At most you can destroy your own territories by attacking nearby ones (as sometimes the targeting is not accurate, but that could be intentionally done by the developers) 2. I faced two occasions where at the end of the game it showed a progress in percentage and the very next screen in main menu the percentage was reduced. I wonder if this can lead to negative percentage progress :D. 3. The Pact feature does not make sense, I mean allies can attack each other (OK maybe acceptable if someone is sneaky) but shouldn't the pact break in that case. 4. Due to the progress percentage glitch you could lose on the unlockable objects. 5. Few of the unlockable objects freeze in the middle of the game. Bottom line, I played the game and I liked it. Given the bugs noticed I would not recommend to buy it (I think there is free version available with Ads). Also, unless I see updates in this game I would not spend on any other game from the developers of this one.",3,18,2.0.5,2019-11-29 02:02:05,,

But there is a lot of room for improvement. 1) When 
explosions go off, the shake/vibration is really annoying. It makes it hard 
to do anything. 2) The trails of missiles are too hard to distinguish. How 
about make friendly trails blue and enemy ones red? 3) I understand 
hardcore mode is supposed to be hard, but even playing as America is 
impossible. He problem is, the Ai can do everything instantly, but id you 
want to nuke someone it's hard. You've got to spend time aiming it, and 
there are often problems when it won't register. 3) when you open a 
nation's menu and tap too quickly it won't register. Huge problem if you 
think you've selected defend but you've really done nothing. 4) the 
unlockable shuperweapons are pretty pointless sometimes. You need to make 
all of them with bonuses and drawbacks, so all are equally balanced but you 
will choose one over another depending on play style.",3,0,2.0.0,2018-08-08 20:02:59,,

Not a lot of strategy required.  You can win building only cruise missiles if you are patient and wait while the other countries destroy each other.  Here are a couple bugs I've encountered:  1)  Sometimes my defensive missiles will shoot at ICBMs aimed at enemy countries instead of the ones aimed at me, even after I've researched the upgrade to know where all missiles are going.  Maddening to have 3 of the big super missiles coming at me and see my defensive missile save an enemy.  2)  Sometimes I'll start with a country that I can't click on.  It just sits there the entire game unable to be accessed.    3)  Other times a country will become unusable during the game.  It will show that I control it and have missiles there, but I can't access it.  4)  Maybe not a bug, but the AI doesn't seem very smart.  The advantage of the stealth bomber is supposed to be that its hard to shoot down.

So I did, and First Stike took me right into full action. I spent at least 90 minutes for the first mission (maybe my tactics were wrong, but this is a different story) and was constantly building, attacking and defending.  The game engine is great: extremely smooth and easy to use interface with lot's of very nice details. It was never so easy to bomb an other country into the stoneage. You learn the controls quick and easy and after some minutes you even skip the tutorials, as the controls are obvious and you just want to conquer the world. The game AI seems to be pretty good, and I guess it will be a lot harder when you try to conquer the earth as North Korea... That said, I would like to say that First Strike is a great game - but you need to calculate some time in, as you can not save the games, but you can pause it. Keep that in mind, if you want to conquer the world.  Fortunately, the nuclear wars in this game are not happening in reality, but they could, and this is the saddest part of the game.  Shall I press the button? Yes, buy it for a good cause.",5,2,1.0.2,2014-03-12 06:23:23,,
