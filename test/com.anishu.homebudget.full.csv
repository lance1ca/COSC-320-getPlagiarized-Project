I have it frequently, but I can't seem to find the pattern to make it replicable. 2) The budget projections are just totaling up your scheduled income and bills.  This isn't very helpful considering the vast majority of my expenses are things that don't have a fixed monthly price attached such as food, and I don't work a constant set of hours, so I never have any projected income.

Been using on mac 2 yrs and android 3mths no stability problems to date. And guess what: it allows import and really fast allocation into spending areas, full customisation of categories, and its not cloud based which i like a) for security and b) because use is not dependent on connection speed. Its just GREAT and who gives that its UI is not flashy as. Have not had any compatibility issues across platforms.

It is far more intuitive to see your budget & balance at the point when you input expenses against a particular category (""whoops, only ¬£20 more to spend on food this month"") rather than have to first look at one screen then remember a balance, before you go to another screen to input the expenses.
