Will only open my document if I point to the file but won't allow me to access via the app. No clue why it behaves like this. Well this is highly embrassing because all my files open exactly as they should. Previously if I chose file open, pointed to any file, click open, the app simply would not respond. Today, everything is working as expected and I have no issue. Please accept my opology, I still can't explain this nor repete the issue i was having. Thank you for your responce.",4,1,,2020-12-27 04:31:32,"We apologize for the inconvenience. Can you be more specific please so that we can identify the issue?
