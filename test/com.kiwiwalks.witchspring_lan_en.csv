I would like to say it's similar to the Atelier series in that crafting plays a big role, but crafting here ends up really only being used for creating stronger spells and spell upgrades. It also uses a time system in that you have 100 days until the game ends, and you get one of 9 endings based on how much you progressed in the plot at the end of the time. I don't like the ever-present pressure these time limits place, but it wasn't too bad here. Story is meh, but passable.",3,1,1.9.8,2021-02-01 11:33:39,,

Failed to see witch's ending, will try again. yes, few translation issues but not a big deal. I mean, you can understand what it means.   Few tips for beginners:  1. Don't stay at home and train for days. I did so for 25 days. worked my way up to 100 hp and 80 mp or so. Go out and hunt and increase stats with items. That's faster.  2. Save as much ingredients as you can and always use them for mixing in pot. Don't just eat them up (except stat increasing items) 3. Do unlock temples fast and faster. Use slowdown item a lot.  4. Dragon is strong, but not strongest. Do unlock top magic which has 7 metors (I believe you get it from 4th temple).  5. In snow map, when you meet ice golems in ice cave, use mental magic. It always works even better than fire magic, just for ice golems. (or more specifically, against heavily armored targets). I lost 10+ days trying to upgrade fire magic which didn't help anyway.  6. Do go to village. You can't, but it'll help you to advance the storyline.   Finally, for devs: please include endless mode.",5,2,1.31,2015-11-08 01:24:47,Thank you for good tips!

With that being said, I absolutely recommend this game.  I had a few dollars in Play Store credit so I decided to buy a game. I eventually chose this game because it looked cute, and no other reason. I can only say that I am very pleasantly surprised by this game. It is very fun, the story is actually pretty good, and I am very happy with my purchase.  This game's English translation is laughable at best, but I feel that adds to the charm. There are some emotional moments in the game where I would normally expect the poor translation to ruin the moment, but surprisingly it didn't.  My biggest surprise with this game was the amount of Extended Story there is after completing the game. I was expecting nothing and hoping for a New Game+, but I was very happy that the story actually extends beyond the normal end, giving me many more hours of playtime while continue to do new things and explore new areas.  All-in-all, I am very happy I played this game, and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to sit down for a few minutes, or a few hours to play an RPG.",5,1,1.31,2015-11-06 15:53:59,Thank you for your detail review and I will prepare the next game with changeless affection! :),2015-11-07 03:35:32
