I went right through my collection of contacts, assigned pictures to each, added an extra GROUP and then curated each contact into the appropriate GROUP category. I deleted the OTHERS and COLLEGES groups, but they insisted on coming right back again! I heeded the warning that the (non-pro) version was no longer supported and splashed out the very reasonable amount requested for the PRO version. BUT: * Almost all of my contacts are now no longer visible. * Of those that remain only three have retained their GROUP allocation. * The extra GROUP that I created is missing. * And STILL the OTHERS and COLLEGES groups can be deleted, but immediately re-appear. It seems that I’d have been better off sticking with the unsupported vanilla version rather than buying PRO! Nothing has actually been lost though because both version of the APP are still on the phone and are exactly as I want them to be. So the purpose of this review is to alert the APP’s author to my (less than appreciated) negative experiences, and in the hope that there is a “just do this” solution to save me the effort of repeating the curating all over again.

I purchased the Pro-version and it co-exists with the unsupported free version. Normally apps combine to form one app. Regrettably this app doesn't consequently you can't tell which is which. The app duplicated all my WhatsApp contacts. Finally the app deleted my contacts so I had to do a restore. This app is far worse than the phone's default app so I have deleted it. I contacted the Developer and he wasn't very helpful which is poor customer service #Avoid,1,5,,2018-11-20 08:02:33,,

I looked in my complete list of apps  (via Settings) and found TWO 'Contacts' - I could discern which version was which by that route, and uninstalled the v5.x.  I had to re-create the shortcut, but it now opens 6.x as desired.  All contact information was preserved and seems to be functioning correctly.  The 6.x version evidently does not correctly (or at all) uninstall the earlier version.  Now, a minor quibble - I had already purchased the 'Simple Thank You' app to support the developer, but then had to pay, admittedly not a lot, for the Simple Contacts Pro app.  I like the app (well, at least the previous version - I hope the 'Pro' version doesn't break anything), but I'm knocking off one star for the items above.",4,6,6.0.0,2018-11-14 05:30:59,,
