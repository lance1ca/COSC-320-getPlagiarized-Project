The puzzles are such a fun way to play with the numbers, developing creative, individualized use of addition and subtraction. The tallest ladders do get a little unwieldy, but it's not a huge problem. I like the bombs in the ladders. It encourages precision, but doesn't give any sort of a FAIL response, just a OOPS, TRY AGAIN. I even recommend this app to my college students who express a phobia with basic calculations.

But it really grew on me.  Love spending time with my five year old and watching him figure out sizes needed to complete the puzzles.  It's clear that he's doing some sort of counting and size comparison in his head.  Great app.  Would buy again.,5,3,1.3,2016-01-13 06:26:53,,

The original dragonbox program was my favourite. It was quite amazing to see my four year old work through the different levels. He and I were compelled. However in some ways it was not obvious that this really had great educational benefit for such a small child. Who knows what he would remember in the future?  This one is just fantastic. Even after a couple of days play it was clear my son was gaining much greater facility with numbers and more than that was completely charmed by the program. I think this beats my previous favourite maths apps made by montesouri and really I think most four to six year olds could benefit from it as they start to discover the properties of numbers.  Only complaint. The app seemed to ask for a lot of privileges when I installed it. I denied most of these, especially about giving access to my phones call facility(?). It seems to work fine but I wonder if this means I will now not get emailed about my son¬¥s progress? Some info clarifying all of this would be helpful DragonBox.",5,2,1.3,2016-01-05 02:26:48,,
