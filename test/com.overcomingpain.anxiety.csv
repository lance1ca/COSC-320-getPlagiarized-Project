This app allows me to continue to use EMDR in my therapy sessions, during virtual sessions from home, due to the pandemic. ... I really enjoy the self-led functions for practice and reinforcement of anxiety-relieving behaviors, even when I am not overly stressed, as regular practice ingrains the behaviors so they become automatic in times of duress. ... I was quite relieved at the clear avoidance of faith/ideals or other topics besides simply healing from anxiety, in the sessions. Many other relaxation/calming apps speak of specific body parts (anxiety for an amputee), use religious wording (a trigger for those abused by ""the faithful""), or visualization guidance that may contain phobias.This was what led me to believe that there were careful, thoughtful, conscientious mental health professionals involved in the creation of this healing tool. ... I told my therapist about this after I evaluated it's functions, and he is very excited to review it himself from a more clinical standpoint, with the intention of possibly suggesting it to his other virtual patients! ... To suggest an improvement; I would like to see a stereoscopic add-on for this app, as it would allow for distraction-free immersive VR functionality with even the most basic of headsets such as Google Cardboard, a huge boon for those of us with high distractability.

Have searched for something similar.  Very smooth ui.  Love the brain graphics, but would prefer a clean slate with solely a trailing dot as is common with EMDR light bars.  In calm focus, less is more.  The speaking on track one was too much for me, but I've used EMDR principles for years to cope with stress and traumas.  So maybe I just really wanted to get to the pure bilateral stimulation.  All in all, will enjoy using it more & look forward to where this might go.",4,5,1.0,2014-06-03 22:49:32,,
