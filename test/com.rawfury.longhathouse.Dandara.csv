I feel like so many devs dumb-down their games for mobile. But DANDARA really innovates and shows that you can have just as great a gaming experience on a phone. This is a stellar game! The mobile control scheme is brilliant. The game requires you to react quickly. It's challenging. The levels are expansive. The 8-bit artwork is beautiful and spectacular. And the story alluded to is poetic. I'm really impressed! Thank you to the team who made it! You're amazing!,5,3,1.4.6,2020-08-29 08:56:41,,

moving. Sometimes, you need to press that button real quick and it's not 
instinctive at all to try and hit that tiny button shoved away at the upper 
right corner. The number of times I've died because I've missed the button 
can make the game very frustrating. If you can make it so the player can 
place the buttons wherever they want, that would be much better. The second 
thing is that the game gets way too hard as you progress. I like a stiff 
challenge but this is ridiculous. Way too unforgivable and too frustrating.

atmospheric, extremely enjoyable metrovania type game.",4,4,1.1.4,2018-08-10 07:24:22,"Hi!

mais de 9h de gameplay. Primeiro, eu adorei o jogo, valeu cada centavo e 
certamente é uma ótima escolha para quem quer um metroidvania que tenta 
inovar. A história, apesar de simples, é cheia de significados, a 
dificuldade é no ponto certo, a mecânica é extremamente interessante e é 
divertido ficar deslizando o dedo para lá e para cá enquanto se move pelo 
cenário. Mas nem tudo são flores. Como ponto negativo, a movimentação, em 
alguns momentos, mais atrapalha do que ajuda. Senti que quando são 
necessários movimentos rápidos, o controle acaba sendo impreciso e isso faz 
com que a experiência seja frustrante em determinadas partes, 
principalmente nas duas últimas áreas. Enfim, parabéns aos desenvolvedores, 
é realmente animador ver jogos tão bons, que exaltam nossa cultura sem cair 
no proselitismo, sendo desenvolvidos no Brasil! I finished the game in 9h 
of gameplay. I loved it, worth the money spent and its a very good choice 
for whom is looking for an metroidvania-like game that innovate the genre. 
The lore is simple but has a lot of metaphors, the difficult is in the 
right level, the mechanics is really interesting and is very funny to swipe 
the finger through the screen to move around the cenarios. But as nothing 
is perfect, there are odds. As a negative point, in some situations, the 
moviment style is really cumbersome. When agile movements are required the 
control can be very inaccurate, leading to frustrating experiences, 
especially in the last two areas. Finally, congratulations to the 
developers, is really awesome to see good games, that exalt our culture 
without being boring, made in Brazil. Still learning english, so please 
forgive any mistake :)",5,4,1.1.4,2018-07-01 22:03:43,,

It's hard to believe that games like these make it to handhelds. My only issue is the game does not support a 18:9 screen ratio and doesn't fill the screen on my Pixel 2 XL. Hopefully we will see an update to support this in the future.,4,36,1.1.1,2018-02-10 21:37:00,,
