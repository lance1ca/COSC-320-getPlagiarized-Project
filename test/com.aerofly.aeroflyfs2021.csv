Love this sim. I would like the Airac database to be updated regularly and an easier way of creating flight plans rather than having to select each way point. Perhaps a flight planning tool which will automatically create the plan. I do love that the procedures for SID and STAR are included at some airfields but not others even though they have them in real life. Would love to see the 757/767 modelled too. I'm sure these would be a great addition and welcomed. Would also like some ATC,4,1,20.21.15,2021-02-07 11:35:57,,

Worth the money. Best graphics and realy love the interactive cockpit. Better than any other flight Sim on mobile. Other games like rfs or infinit flight are completely out of the game compared to this one. I would just like to see multiplayer in future updates. I 100% recommend this game.,5,0,,2021-02-05 15:01:19,,

The problems i see are that they ignored southwest florida (ie. Naples) when making the south Florida map. Another problem is the graphics for some of the panels in the aircraft. An example being the king air, the panels are unreadable and i cannot use the high graphics quality. A fix to this could be that you can adjust separate graphics categories (ie aircraft, terrain, panels)",3,6,20.21.11,2021-02-04 06:52:06,,

The new version with improved copilot and traffic is amazing and the expansion of regions is a very welcome. A new selection of aircraft would be good at some point but I think we have enough to fly around in the meantime! I was lucky enough to fly small aircraft when I was much younger and before it got very expensive and this has really reignited the bug! Thanks to the developers and testers for an incredible job.,5,13,20.21.11,2021-02-01 01:21:29,,

One thing that I wish and I don't know if it's possible is if on a replay the other planes moved as they do when you're flying. From what I've seen they're frozen in time and don't move if you replay the flight. Youd get 1,000 ‚≠ê's if it were allowed. Keep up the amazing work!",5,14,20.21.11,2021-01-30 18:31:09,,
