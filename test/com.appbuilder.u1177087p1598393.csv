I noticed although starting out on my first one being the wide weave braid, it says to use start #2. It actually appears to be start #4 from the photos. Either way it functioned. Also the measurements must be for sure an estimation, I would suppose due to everyone making the braid slightly different. But, I did try to double the measurement for a longer braid and ended up too short still. Looks like notes will be needed.",5,2,3.1.0,2020-09-03 16:48:23,,

Looks well put together and a simple and basic starter app. Just what I was looking for. Also no adds which is a huge bonus. To anyone complaining about paying Â£1.37 it's less than a cup of coffee and would easily be Â£5+ as a book,5,1,3.1.0,2020-02-02 11:27:53,,
