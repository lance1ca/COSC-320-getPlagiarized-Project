No obvious method for choosing either the correct hiragana sound or English definition for a displayed Kanji character, or to write the correct Kanji for either the English word or Hiragana spelling. You choose the card deck based on lesson number from the books. Then, start the deck. It shows the English meaning, the hiragana spelling, and a blank where the Kanji will go. You tap on the blank, and the Kanji appears. How does this help learn Kanji? How is this a ""flash card""? If I want to just see Kanji characters, their meaning, and pronunciation, I can look in the Genki textbooks. A flash card app is supposed to give the student a way to input an answer - either the sound or definition of a Kanji, or the Kanji for a sound and/or definition. This app seems to offer neither.

This assures I'm learning the kanji that I need for school, rather than other kanji not relevant to me at this time.     My only complaint is that I can't hide the English words in Reading mode, and I know that sometimes I am just translating the word instead of actually remembering the kanji reading. I would love to have a mechanism to hide/unhide the English word, the same way you can hide/unhide the hiragana reading.    I do love being able to flip the card over and see different readings ad well as the stroke order and mnemonic pictures though :)     I definitely will continue to use this app, but I hope to see it update in the future",4,8,1.0,2017-02-03 14:31:46,,
