But, the system kept quitting on me, wouldn't let me use all my doses, and is now locked, even though I have spent quite a bit of money on the doses. Very Positive Update-Jan 2, 2021 My phone was stolen early in October, and I thought that all my money spent was wasted. But, i-Doser worked with me, providing me with free doses to listen to on my computer, and helping me to use the system properly. I wish that I had clicked on the buttons for the helpers, Jennifer, and the I-bot (not sure if I got that right,) because they were very helpful; and that would have saved me a lot of trouble in the beginning. And, this week I will finally have the money to get fully connected with them, again, something that I am looking forward to very much. I love the way that i-Doser works, and the sensations that it can produce, and how it can even help the memory. To show how well it works at this, I had an invention that I was working on for quite a while, but I lost the paper work when I moved to a different city. And I got too busy with my new job to take it up again. Well, one afternoon I decided to listen to a binaural beat from i-Doser to help me with my memory, through dreams. Was I ever surprised when, I had 3 fairly short dreams, in the course of an hour. And, in the second dream, there I was, sitting at my desk, and looking at the drawing of the part that I had devised. Now, I'm working with two lawyers, and a patent/trademark company, to get my plan on the road. I think that this says a lot for the effectiveness of your work. .And I must also say that I appreciate the professionalism with which I was dealt, especially when I was feeling so down with all that was going on. I say to you all out there, looking into brainwave entrainment, don't bother with any of the other binaural providing companies. They simply don't work, and are a true waste of time.

It works well, is reliable, and (assuming you have decent headphones) the sound quality is superb.  The ""doses"" for the app version are relatively short, usually around 15 min.  But the ""slipstream"" lets you set up to repeat a dose more than once or set up an assortment of doses to make yourself a custom sequence with up to 15 slots.  So you can put together a session up to almost 4 hours long if you wish.  It does what it was made to do well enough that I can't think of a reason to give it less than the 5 stars.  It could be better though.  The app version doesn't get the ""love"" that the full Mac and Windows computer versions get.  As of this review, it hasn't been updated in over a year.  For the computer version, there are always new doses, promotions, specials and events like I-Doser's youtube challenges that just don't really happen for the app version.  But this app works well and I-Doser's facebook group is still worth checking out for the articles and etc.  So 5 stars, no doubts about that.",5,6,1.5.4,2017-05-21 00:10:50,Thank you so much for the amazing review.

Most of the mobile devices these days have GBs of space - limiting it to 15 mins IS pointless. I find it rather as a sales tactic to get quick money. And looping them is worthless - most binaural beats begin with specific frequency and change to its goal frequency. Saying looping is the solution is like saying start with light relaxation, then go deeper and once you start experiencing deeper relaxation go back to normal state and start over again !

The doses are very pleasent to listen to with the added music with only one or two being too cheesy or misplaced, they're not too long and suprisingly effective! This turned me from a sceptic to a believer. If it is not working for you start by following the basic guide provided with the app, if you follow it through and have good headphones for the job I can't see why it wouldn't work. The other thing is: it's a great, great deal. If I paid little more than 3‚Ç¨ for a 20 doses, I've tried most of them and they all have something to it, be it mild or intense. The app does have some technical problems though, starting with the fact that you can't play two or more doses one after the other without manually switching between them because it force closes. This is especially a bummer because moving after Condition and before the actual dose is not ideal as the creators know. All in all good job I-Doser, I'll definitely be buying more doses from you guys in the future. You fix your app and I'd give 6 stars if I could. Cheers!",4,0,1.2.1,2014-06-19 07:28:25,,

I wish it had a simple energy beat, but I'm highly impressed with the sleep one so far. Works great. After I bought the lucid dreams, it didn't download. I just had to hit buy again.

If you're a skeptic (as I was) of binaural beats, then try it with a skeptic's mind and determine if this stuff is the real deal. It's changed my life and erased my chronic fatigue.",5,4,1.0,2011-06-07 04:39:58,,
