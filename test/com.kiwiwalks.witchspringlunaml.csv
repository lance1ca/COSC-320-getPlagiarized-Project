First, the graphics and music are stunningly beautiful, and I really love the whole story (including the sub stories). It even made me cry several times! Highly relatable and meaningful. After 10+ hours of hour I did get a S+ for clearing the game. There are several drawbacks which the maps in the game are really confusing, and gathering pets became repetitive. The training and battle mechanisms are also rather boring. One thing about the translation: I played the lite version in English before, so when I tried Chinese I found out that the meaning is quite weird. It just don't suit with the English version. I ended up in Eng ver. But if possible, Chinese ver. really needs improvement. Overall it is worth as my first purchased game!",5,0,1.35,2019-06-26 01:14:24,,

The storyline is simple but engaging, and the battle system is also simple but has some depth that allows for strategizing. My favourite feature was probably the real time overhead map, it allows you to see at a glance what enemies you can fight and what gathering points are active. I would have liked to be able to scroll the map, but it's only a minor gripe. None of the fights were particularly challenging, except for a few enemies whose stats scale to your own. If you grind your stats to fight or the optional bosses along the way, the final story boss is a walk in the park, which was a bit anti climactic. You can also just power through the game if you have enough patience to grind stats over and over again right at the very beginning.",5,11,1.35,2018-11-14 17:51:25,,

feature is that there is no 100 day time limit, so you don't feel rushed to 
complete the game. Instead, you have a day-to-night system that follows the 
moon cycle. Full moon nights make Luna's magical abilities more effective. 
I also liked that Luna doesn't have her energy depleted easily, unlike in 
the first game. The crafting system allows for more powerful spells & stat 
raising items, and there are more spell types & items than in the first 
game. My favorite feature of the game was the variety of subquests you can 
do to enrich the storyline, which involves Luna learning to reopen her 
heart to friendship after two painful betrayals. There is also post game 
content that lets you explore some new places & add an epilogue to the 
story. Overall, this game has great gameplay, a heartwarming storyline, &

The story is nice, and the gameplay is great. There are a few grammer things, but really few and not really noticeable. I kinda do wish it was a bit harder because when I got to the 'last boss', he could only do 1 damage to me, while I removed like 4/5 of his health in one shot(I mean, it was the strongest spell I had, but I recovered about 3/5 of the mana used on that per turn, so...) You get stronger by gaining stats(either by items, training, or combat), and unlike a lot of games, your growth gets faster the stronger you are, which is nice, as meeting a difficult opponent doesn't mean hours of grinding xp. One qualm I have is that it the storyline seems to be rather short, but there does seem to be more after 'The end' so that remains to be seen Overall, great game!

The game provides such a heartwarming story full of happy, funny, and sad moments, and everything in between. Truly a beautiful story and work of art :')  The game mechanics are truly unique from (and in my opinion, way better than...) your typical ""grind and level-up"" RPG. Needless to say, it's an amazing game that will have you falling in love with Luna (the main character) and wanting to find out what happens next! Definitely 100x better than 99.9% of the games on the app store right now, and way cheaper too! I highly, HIGHLY recommend this game. Also, tons to do after finishing the story.

Elemental resists, Physical dmg balance, harder enemies. Player advancement through crafting and guaranteed Attribute + drops needs to be fixed. Why is Luna afraid of warriors when she could easily wipe out all of them without much effort. They need something to warrent such hesitation.

The characters are cute and not over designed. The art is better than I thought it would be, and the model work is very well done. However, what hooked me is how absolutely jolly this game is.    A combination of the simple yet perfect music, the personality of the main character, the lighthearted humor, the variety of pets, and the instant gratification of gaining permanent stats while not having to worry about experience or levels; it all comes together to deliver you a good time.    You can play the game at your own pace. If any of the enemies are ever too strong for you to handle, you can craft some new equipment and spells, or find some stat training items. If you want to breeze through the game, it lets you quickly grind right outside your house (I don't enjoy grinding, but it's an option available for you anyway). You can choose how difficult you want this game to be by how you build your character.    I've seen much less polish on games I've paid $60 for.

Witch Spring 2 has everything you could want from a single-player RPG: a vast, interesting world to explore; an engrossing story that had me going ""D'aww"" and ""I feel like I'm dying inside from all this sadness""; characters with heart, humour, and personality; fun combat; and that old staple, watching numbers go up to fight bigger, badder monsters.  And I'm happy to report that though the grind could have been terrible and tedious, the devs have made it very quick and very painless. Plus, there is few things more satisfying to do in-game than to face a giant monster you once went out of your way to avoid because it would one-shot you, then destroy them in one turn by summoning a giant amalgamation of flaming meteors down on its head.  This is a game with heart, with passion, with plenty of love and attention that all adds up to a very fun experience and a memorable story full of moments that will stick with me for a good, long time.",5,0,1.28,2016-11-06 03:05:07,Thank you for your detail review:) The next WitchSpring will be much better!
