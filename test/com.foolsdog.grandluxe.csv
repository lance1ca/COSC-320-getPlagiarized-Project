A picky person about tarot decks gives 5 stars lol. It is just the right amount of weight without being super heavy. The artwork really captures the essence of each card for me, making it easy to read. I was so glad they mass market released a physical deck that wasn't 200 dollars like the original collector's edition. I have had this app and been using it for a long time, and finally have a companion ""in my hands"" deck to go with it. I use both. Thank you thank you.",5,2,2.1.5,2019-09-09 19:29:08,,
