Search options are alright, significantly worse than Gatherer and disorganized but acceptable for basic deckbuilding.  The pricing sources would be a great addition, if it ever worked for me. Either they take forever to load or just don't even bother loading at all. Testing the deck is difficult because of how sensitive swiping cards is. Barely touch the screen the wrong way and the whole board is ruined.  There will be moments where image loading simply stops and I need to completely clear the search options with the back button and search again to load images.

I'm able to carry reference of my entire collection with me whenever I go to shops, toy with deck building any time I feel the urge, and easily find out when I purchase new cards wether or not I already have them in my collection.   The only two real frustrations I have with the app is that the play-test doesn't allow for testing against another deck (but it is still useful to gain a feel for how a deck is likely to play,) and that cards reissued as promotional cards do not have the option to add them as the promo card, but rather only as the original set's release.   I realize that the first is a rather large undertaking, and as the primary function of this app is deck building/collection management, I cannot fault the developers for this. The second, however, does leave me wanting improvement, as it affects the accuracy of the collection management aspect of the app.    I have however dropped my rating to three stars from 5 as the app now crashes regularly when attempting to load the deck management tab. This is rectified only by removing and reinstalling the app. While I'm still able to use the deck function after doing so, eventually the bug reappears and I have to go through the deletion process again.  Another star had been lost because in addition to the deck-view causing the app to crash, now viewing individual cards also causes the app to shut down. I have had to uninstall and reinstall the app every time I have gone more than 24 hours between uses for the past month and a half.

Generally works well and is easy to use. Had no issues with app not running/opening like some others seem to. I like the analytics of deck composition (color, mana cost, card type, etc). A few suggestions: 1) it would be faster to enter cards manually if you could add them directly from the search results list. As it is you have to drill down into an individual card before you get the add buttons. 2) Voice search would also speed up this process. 3) Would be nice to have some more analytics: maybe scores for things like mana acceleration, interrupts/cancels, card draws, life gain/loss etc.  Would be cool if collection feature linked to site(s) like TCGPlayer that keep card collections in the cloud. 5) Collection feature is nice but would also like to see a card wishlist(s).",4,2,2.4.3,2015-03-02 05:59:15,,
