Easy to use. One time payment. Requested gif or boomerang feature. Would be perfect. I prefer that over the video.. videos feel a little weird. Also records last 3 seconds of the 5 second clips on note 20. Maybe a reaolution/read write issue. But I stick with photos. Which may or may not be worth the price as it then is just a multi shot camera. But either way it's 5 star worthy as far as no bug or errors,5,1,77,2021-01-01 21:44:05,Thanks üòä,2021-01-02 01:43:07

So many, that I am sure that I got on his nerves (LOL). He kindly responded to each and every email, and addressed any issues or questions that I may have had. At the beginning he offered me a refund since I was having a few issues, but I did no want a refund. Even at this point, I felt like the app was well worth the price that I paid.    I continued to play with the app, to see what features it had.  The more I played with it, the more I liked it.  I still had more questions and a few issues, but I continued to email the developer.    On to the day of the event.  I there were a few issues with the with app, but nothing major. For some reason when we hit the print option, it went to the email, instead of the print screen.  All in all the guest loved it, and the app did not fail me.  The app has some issues, but not enough for me to give it less then a 5 star.  Thanks for the great app, keep up the good work.

We customized the layout to take two vertical strips w/ our names at the bottom, and it worked great  (both little kids and older adults figured it out just fine). The author was really helpful in assisting us, and even added a quick feature that we needed to get the look just right. We are so happy that we used this app for our photobooth, the pictures looked great! Thanks @medtoure!  Here was our setup:  1. We used our phone, mounted to a car phone mount w/ a suction bottom, attached to a metal plate to keep it stable. 2. We used the ""keep screen on"" setting in photobooth mini and only displayed the ""take photo"" button. The photos used a minimal ""black and white"" design with 2 vertical halves that people could cut into 2 strips. 3. We used a Canon Selphy printer to print photos. 4. We used an old router to connect the phone + printer (we turned off mobile data on the phone so it wouldn't disconnect) 5. People would take the photos, press the print button, which would show the phone's default ""print"" screen with the selphy printer already selected. They pressed ""print"" again and the photo would print!",5,2,45,2018-08-23 02:35:02,"Hello Chris, thanks for this great review",2018-08-23 13:00:39
