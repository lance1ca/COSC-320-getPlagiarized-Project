I swapped over to the mobile version of this game because I could not draw at all on the switch version. It was not detecting any touch inputs on the screen. Thankfully the mobile version does work, albeit is rather laggy and didn't work at first... the templates failed to load properly and had no way of erasing the parts that were supposed to be transparent. Until they fix the level and draw lag please don't get this. I'm sorry.",2,7,1.0.1,2020-12-13 20:44:16,,

The controls are hard to get used to, and make the puzzles more difficult, but everything else about this game is amazing! Personally, I prefer the Switch and Steam versions of this game, but this is still a really solid version of the game!",5,1,1.0,2020-12-11 12:10:11,,

It's horribly optimized on Android and that really should be fixed.,3,4,1.0,2020-12-08 14:05:59,,

Although the controls for the mobile version is a bit odd, you can use controllers from what I heard. Drawing is a bit harder due to having no zoom in and out option, but the templates are very pretty and nice to look at if you don't want to draw all the time. The songs are very good too!",5,11,1.0,2020-12-07 17:05:38,,

The game is enjoyable so far but I do have a few complaints. Drawing is a bit clunky, I wish there was a zoom function to do able to fill and draw pixel perfect. I wish story missions would save your place, for example I exited during the mission after Heather and I was kicked all the way back and had to do the Heather levels all over again. Gameplay is kind of glitchy at times. Overall, 3/5.",3,14,1.0,2020-12-07 10:28:57,,

Considering the depth of this game and the amount of story woven in, it is amazing to think that they've fit it all on mobile - and got it to play perfectly too.",5,5,1.0,2020-12-07 08:50:34,,
