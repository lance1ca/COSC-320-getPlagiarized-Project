Im playing for about an hour now, and the only thing that bothers me is the camera movement. Adjusting it is quite intuitive but not really. Also, when a piece attacks, camera changes are too chaotic. Oh, and one thing more. When I'm trying to restart the mission or do anything else in menu, and the enemy attacks, it closes the menu because of camera angle changes. Please make the menu stay opened because I have to be really quick to choose option I want before it closes.",5,6,2.4,2019-09-14 00:57:35,,

there is one thing you need to understand before getting this. If you do 
not like chess AND Warhammer you're not going to like this game. If you 
like chess but do not enjoy orks with rocket packs you're not going to like 
this. If you enjoy shouty Space Marines but dislike like chess you also are 
not going to like this game. However if you enjoy both of these things you 
might get some fun out of this. Each unit has the standard chess piece 
movement patterns depending on their class. But they also have health bars 
for when you engage in shooting matches with the Enemy. You destroy any 
units by either performing standard chess maneuvers (which is a instant 
kill regardless of hp) or doing enough damage through gunfire and melee 
combat to kill them. There are a number of different attacks for each class 
of unit and they all have cool enemy kill animations The game does have 
in-app purchases most however can be earned through in-game currency. There 
are two however that require real money. One is a new campaign. And the 
other is a new map. The Space Marine factions include blood angels and 
Raven guard to start with the Dark Angels, Space Wolves, and ultramarines 
being unlockable. The Orcs have the Goffs the snakebites free with the 
blood axes, death skulls and evil Sonz as unlockables.",4,1,2.4,2018-04-17 20:20:33,,

The entertainment is a sinful pleasure of mine. I can play for hours when I get a chance. It really is a breath of fresh air if you're looking for a twist to revive your chess game.   Keep in mind that your game strategy will change based on the battle feature of the game. Pawns and rooks are worth more. The pieces are difficult to distinguish between, but an option to symbolize the piece makes it much better. Then it's like figuring out which symbol is the bishop, knight etc.  The game is not very challenging until you get to Act 3 or Veteran master level. Just be careful to read the board before moving and you should win every time. At least in regicide mode. The AI is surprising sometimes.  I like the leveling feature. Your abilities grow as you continue to win. The game doesn't make you buy anything. You can focus on the strategic part of the game without concern of paying for more ability.  Don't give up on the campaign Against All Odds. Just bring up the bottom knight to support the top knight in a two rook split maneuver. Keep all of your defense skills active on your king but not all at once. The AI will not make the best move after losing his first rook. Keep replaying until you get lucky on the battles. In the end you will take both rooks and win the game.  I do have some suggestions to make it a better game experience:  At least in the campaign mode, the pawns do not get promoted. That is a show stopper, so now what do I do with them? All of the other rules of chess seem to be in place.  Multiplayer is nonexistent.  I couldn't find anyone to play against.  Have a way to determine which chess pieces are part of the objectives in the campaign mode. It gives the the name of the piece instead of rooks, queen, etc. Most of the time I'm just forced to guess which pieces to focus on.  Well, back to playing.",5,1,2.2,2017-06-19 07:28:32,,

Also getting a draw is too easy since when you are winning hands down the enemy king will often corner themselves or run away a lot forcing a draw without trying.
