I've been stuck on the last level of the Great Wizard for a while... RNG hates me. Love the questing motivation for us solo folk. I really enjoy regular Talisman and would love to see more DLC for that along these lines. Just more solo content all around and quest stuff in general.,5,3,23.07,2020-11-01 18:06:07,,

I'm a big fan of Talisman. The game has all the elements I enjoy: cards, board, fantasy setting, good mix of strategy & chance, lots of variability, replayability, dice rolling...... Now this solo mode is really done well! I like the ""quest"" idea and it gives the game a focus. I still play the original Talisman game when I want to just play a general game online or against the AI, but Origins gives this game a new way to play.
