If I start a non-cached song, it plays, but then if I got back and play it again, I'll hear 200-400ms of the song then it will try and skip to the next.  DSub skips all songs until it finds one that it can stream (i.e. not cached).  Same for mp3 and FLAC files.  In case something was messing up with my Subsonic server, I did a binary compare of the cached files on the SD cards that DSub created and the original files - they are bit-for-bit identical.

The music caching option for seamless playback works great, esp. with spotty connections I might get with my cell carrier to my servers at home.  An improvement that the app could use is less wasted space towards the middle when the song is playing. Maybe a visualizer could be added or easier access to the equalizer and other audio settings could be made available without clicking around too much.   Would like to see an section or tab for cached songs for easy playback.

But the Subsonic server (not DSub) has a few issues concerning browsing large collections:  You can list 1) albums alphabetically; 2) Genres; or 3) browse the library  as file structure (typically Artist\Album) or tags (Artist\Album).  But, Subsonic has no handling of multiple artists or multiple genres on one album, even creating problems since semicolon "";"" is simply omitted in artists, leading to strange artists like ""BachMozart"" as opposed to ""Bach; Mozart"", or one entry ""Bach"" and another ""Mozart"" for same album. Can be mitigated somewhat by the ""Browse by tags"" server setting, resulting in  an artist called ""Bach/Mozart"". Likewise the genre listing suffers when the genre filed has many entries, since each combination of many  genres is understood as one new unique genre, e.g. ""Jazz; Bob"" is not the same as ""Bob; Jazz"", nor ""Jazz"", nor ""Bob"". Many other databases like MediaMonkey, iTunes handles all this excellently, but not Subsonic. Conclusion is that DSub, though as excellent as it gets, is limited when navigate among your 100.000 albums/tracks. DSub still gets 5 stars. But Subsonic, please do fix this.",5,1,5.2.2,2016-09-07 12:07:15,,

Omer GOLGELI,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh5R9WKAYwhfidnxKEqnA8k0vDtcJg3Dgw4jRJKIP8,Really nice app.  I'm using it with Madsonic. It does what I want it to do. It's better looking than the official app as well as being more customizable. What I wonder is can you make it play random songs instead of random albums? It's no fun to listen to the whole album,4,2,5.1.9,2016-06-20 04:22:28,You can change it to shuffle by songs instead by unchecking the setting at Settings - Playback - Shuffle By Album near the bottom,2016-06-23 13:30:26

The only way to get it playing is to press the pause button and then press play again. This happens in offline mode as well as online mode.

I found that the playback problem seems to be related to my bluetooth speaker (UE Boom). When i use dsub w/o the bluetooth speaker, everything seems to behaves normally. Very strange problem.

I have to hit play to make it play the next track.  I find the DSub/Subsonic interfaces much more intuitive and easier to use than Google Play Music app so this is extremely disappointing.   I'm basically stuck using dsub/subsonic apps to download music to my phone and using different apps to actually play back the music.    Otherwise this is a great alternative to the stock app.  So if you don't care about bluetooth then I do highly recommend this.  ***EDIT*** Beta is available that makes bluetooth work PERFECTLY in my car.   5 stars for when that beta is released to the play store.
