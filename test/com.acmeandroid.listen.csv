Since my criticisms were invalid, it is now my default podcast/audiobook app and worth the money.  == Original review ==  Works, but insufficiently better to justify the price. 1.) Smart Audiobook Player does most of what this does and is free. 2.) This doesn't read tags, so just displays file names, which is bad user experience. 3.) Every time you go to listen to a book it asks if you want to download cover art, and there seems to be no way to turn it off. Fix 2 and 3 and it might be worth the cost.  == Amended review ==  (1) Understood. However: (a) All the Smart Audiobook features added by IAP are not ones about which I care. (b) I don't use the family stuff, so don't care that LAP supports them. (2) Ah, excellent. This was enabled but did not work.. but now does. Perhaps it just needed time to parse all of the tags? Unsure. Criticism removed. (3) I missed that option. Thank you.",5,1,4.5.9,2019-02-27 07:33:35,"Thanks for your update and support. [1. Smart has IAP and LAP works with family sharing. 2.

No matter if I have headphones connected or not, or whether the screen is on or not, the timer never hits zero, so it never stops playing automatically.

It has the ability to adjust volume per book, it remembers place between devices, oh my the list of features and everything seems to actually work.  I do wish there was a spoken word/audiobook EQ profile, but I think that is actually an Android issue not a Listen issue.  So I am not going to ding Listen for it.

Has the 10 sec rewind  button I was looking for. I listen to podcasts and audios a lot. Lately I've been converting Youtube videos to MP3s (there are webpages that will let you do this) so I can listen to them on my phone.  But stock audio players don't handle them well--they treat them like songs. So if you close them and open them again, you have to start the MP3 over from the beginning again. This is horrible if you have a 2.5 hour interview you're listening to.  Listen Audiobook Player handles these very well. I can close the app and reopen it and pick up right where I left off. One thing that made it a bit hard to use at first: you have to go into settings and tell it to show Internal Storage in the menu (if that's where you put your MP3). Once you do that, the phones internal directories are avaliable in the menu for selecting the audio you want to hear. Once I figured that out, I was good to go! Oh, and the lock screen player controls are great! Definitely worth the $1.50",5,0,4.3.28,2016-01-11 19:55:12,,

It really shines in sleep timer management: it lets you set it to run during part of the day, which is brilliant, and the warning mechanism, and especially the ease of resetting it so that the timer starts all over are beautifully thought out and implemented. Ambling Pro is deficient in all of that, since it constantly turns off the timer setting, there's no way to make it turn on for some part of the day, and it's a pain to get the timer to restart .

I have been spoiled by the features in the Audible player.  I have a few audiobooks on CD that I have wanted to  keep in my library, but I didn't want to (or couldn't) re-buy them in Audible.  Listen Audiobook Player includes all of the features that I want (for MP3 files).  First and foremost is the ability to listen to a book faster than the recorded speed.  I love how I can tune the speed rather than a few discrete speed steps.  In this regards, Listen beats out Audible.",5,0,4.1.4,2014-09-06 07:36:17,,

I had some troubles with my past audiobook reader on KitKat, so I went looking. Was doubtful about this one at first - simply because it was just .99. Don't let that fool you. This is obviously a labor of love. That said, the pros - starts up fast (prev reader was painfully slow) - just copy audiobook in folder to your audiobook root, no 'scan' step - very configurable cover display - skip/play/pause icons on lockscreen when playing - syncs with other players via dropbox - sleep timer (which I don't use, but it seems to work) - variable rewind depending on time paused (wow!) - resume playing after phone call, depending on length of call - remembers volume - works with system intents (play/pause, skip, etc., so good for car mode launchers with these built in) - - has both file seek and book seek. The con (single item) - only one audiobooks folder (a don't-care for me but you might) )  Works great on KitKat with both the Dalvik and new ART android run-time engines. I've only been using this a couple of days and it's already my favorite app. Do yourself a favor and buy it before the dev comes to his senses and raises the price. Yes, it's that good.",5,0,3.2.6,2014-05-07 13:59:46,[edit: removing old support comments],2014-05-07 17:51:09

Nothing is more infuriating than losing your place in your book, and this is something that has happened to me in almost every other audiobook player I've tried. Others get whiney about format and number of files. Others are clunky in their playback. Others are tied to proprietary subscription services.  This app is precisely what I want and need from an audiobook player.  Don't get me wrong - I love audible, and their app is relatively solid, but that only helps me for titles I've purchased through them.

For this reason, it's handy for me to organize these by name of series as scrolling through a list of hundreds of books to find the one I want is tedious. Autoscan did a great job of this, and lets me reorganize the books within each to play by the proper order. This is one of my favorite features in MortPlayer, and I'm very happy to see it here.   Chapter skip takes me to the next book... for me this is OK, since I don't have chapter marks in many of them (most are home-made). I imagine this is to function for MP3 books which often have chapters as individual files, mine have been joined into m4b files. Would be great if I could somehow differentiate between chapters in an m4b and files within a book series. Alternately, a feature for multiple play lists could replace this.  To find my place (say if I fall asleep) requires me to move forward or back in one minute increments, which is much too tedious.
