For example objects let my character going, even he should be blocked. Can't wait for new updates. Also boof in the middle of big screen is kinda hard to tap while playing (it's to far).

I've played it quite a bit and haven't been able to even get past the first check point except once or twice, and the next time I went to play, I had to start from the beginning of the level. The game is fairly unforgiving since you're always in motion, if you were able to control when your character moved, the platforming portions would be much more manageable. Also the control buttons are locked in the farthest corners of the screen.",3,10,0.3,2020-02-28 19:50:44,,
