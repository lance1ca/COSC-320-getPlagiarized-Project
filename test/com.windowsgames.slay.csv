It is perfect on the mobile platform. Very fun strategy game with a ton of levels. Only complaints I have are in regards to a mobile feature and the sounds. The 'hold to march' feature is really nice when I have a lot of units but the problem is that the map scrolls when I try to hold down on a space. I like to have sounds on but sounds overlap. It would be nice to have the ability to disable select sounds because I can't hear the victory horns.,5,0,1.1.1,2019-01-14 17:02:43,,

Something that really helped when I was first learning the game on the PC was always visible unit costs, faction strengths, and the total wages of all units in a selected region. I understand that screen space is an issue on a mobile game, but I think not having that information visible up front could make the subtleties of the game harder to learn. -The sound is a little jarring. I like that the game uses the same sharp, loud shouts and trumpet sounds as the PC version, but I think an option to turn the volume down a little would be convenient (as opposed to having to adjust the device volume every time I start the game).
