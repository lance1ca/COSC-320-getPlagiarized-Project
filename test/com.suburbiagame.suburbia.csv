Another big plus is that app does all of the calculations  when you put down new tiles.  You can preview that changes and move the tile around a bit to look for a better placement before deciding to make it permanent.  Single player works well.  The campaign offers difficult goals to complete while removing two extra tiles each turn like a 3 player game.  It always removes the lowest two tiles, so you can't save them for later.  Hopefully they'll add the Suburbia Inc expansion as DLC in the future.  Oh, plus the recently announced 5 Star expansion.  Those would be an instant buy for me!

It's a faithful recreation of the popular board game with a very nice interface that translates perfectly to the tablet. Compared to the price of the physical game, this is a *steal*.  I've been really enjoying the campaign mode and, as a new player, it's been a helpful tutorial on strategy. A frequent complaint about the campaign mode is that there's a bug in the tile connectivity. Having come across this a few times myself, I now at least understand what's happening; it may be a bug or maybe it's just a question of interpretation. The important point is this: the starting tiles on the board are not considered to be connected to one another _even if they're touching._ This means that if you have (as in Salt Lake City) a row of four lake tiles at one end and a stadium at the other, it's not enough to connect the ""clump"" of lake tiles to the stadium. Each lake tile must have a path, consisting of player-placed tiles, connecting it to the stadium tile. Of course multiple paths can use the same tiles, so in practice this means just one or two extra tiles to tie all of the lake tiles into the main path.",5,3,1.1.4,2014-10-26 11:34:01,,
