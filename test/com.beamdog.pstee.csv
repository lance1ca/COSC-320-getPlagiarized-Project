If you're wondering how it would perform on your device then I recommend you look up my specs on gsmarena and compare my CPU and RAM to your own. USABILITY: It's a tiny screen for a title like this (4.7"") but I'm just happy to be playing this on my phone. Fine selections on a screen this small are tough but doable if you have the patience. I have yet to get into any serious combat, but I suspect I will be using the pause function quite a lot to compensate for my inaccuracy. I may end up experimenting with a tiny stylus. TEXT READABILITY: Look, on a 4.7"" screen... it's okay. If you have a blue-light filter on your phone it might even be comfortable. I need more time to evaluate this. GAMEPLAY (UI): One feature I already wish was implemented is the ability to auto loot item drops in an area by taping a button on the bottom left panel. Because it would save a lot of scanning for loot and trying to tap on tiny piles. I'd also love it if loot laying on the ground was highlighted - shaded an fluctuating lighter color or slowly sparkling. Subtle movements such as these are great ways to convey new /relevant info to the player. MUSIC: I'm loving it so far. It's pretty high quality stuff. DIALOGUE: Heh, I think this is going to be fun.

Totally fleshed out game, lots of dialogue options, interesting location, and I'm playing on an Amazon tablet where I had to separately download the Google apk and zero bugs. So, it's got everything that should make me want to give 5 stars... But, I actually find myself hating the actual game. I love baldurs gate, but I find i really didn't love this game. I think there are several reasons why I liked one and not the other: I like making my own characters in rpg games. i don't mind if they have backstories, but I NEED the character to otherwise be my own in an RPG. See, making my own character makes me interested in knowing other characters/world bc I now have a somewhat vested interest in the ""wellbeing"" of my character. But, you're stuck as a male human, I could give two poops about having the option to change my class, that doesn't interest me. SO, where normally I love dialogue in games, I absolutely hated it in this game where the vast majority of the game takes place in dialogue bc I did NOT like my character. Seriously, there's a dungeon or two with respawning monsters just bc there is so little actual combat. As a result, I was utterly bored and uninterested in almost everything going on in the game, rushing through dialogue and lore where normally I would have read everything, bc I hated my character (not to mention everything seemed tailored for a straight guy, I think I would have been more interested in my character if I could have at least made him gay if I couldn't have a female character. seriously, so many female harlots, never saw a male, and oh, the descriptors for female npcs... Never read a descriptor talking about a ravishing guy looking up at you from working the forge, his open shirt displaying a brawny chest, glistening with sweat... But oh boy, could hardly click on a female character without getting a novel about her looks, which most of them just happened to be ""hot""). So, if you find yourself preferring combat or have similar preferences to me, I wouldn't say don't ever play the game, but I will give caution and certainly recommend one of the other dnd games, first.",3,0,3.1.3.0,2018-01-17 01:03:48,,

For example, the dialogue confirmation (Show more) button  below dialogue options is about 1/3 of the size of the dialogue confirmation button below dialogue options in BG:EE and the others. I really wish that the dialogue window was wider. I have to press the ""Show more"" button several times to make it through a conversation. The dialogue window is about 50% of the width of the screen in PST:EE, but about 80% of the width of the screen in BG:EE. Planescape Torment is known for the dialogue!!!!
