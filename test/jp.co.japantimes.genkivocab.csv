Audio examples of word on front of card and audio examples of simple sentences on the back of card.  The audio is spoken at a reasonable speed. Good simple kanji/hiragana/katakana sentence examples on the back of the card, where the rest of the sentence is at the learning level of the card. You can review the cards as Japanese or English. You can shuffle cards You can temporarily remove cards that you already know. You can pick multiple lesson card sets. An English<>Japanese dictionary where all of the entries are from the cards. Cards are grouped by the learning level of the text book.  What could be better: If your screen is set to full zoom, the show answer button covers the hiragana.

It gives you the word and you click if you know it yet or not or if you are unsure (don't know how that differs from know). Then you can be tested on the words you don't know and it asks you if you know them again. This probably really works for some people though. All in all it is a usefull app as it has all the words in genki in one place; however, for the price I feel like  there should be more ways to learn.",3,11,1.2,2016-04-13 08:09:21,,
