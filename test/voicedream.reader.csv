Seeing books as thumbnails is superior to other TTS readers on here.........The previous Android versions had quite a few problems but the dev is v responsive and has been busy using user-feedback to FIX them. Some of the fixes include: 1) Your book list is now KEPT after reinstall - yay! 2) The major problem of the page jumping around has been tackled - we'll see if it comes up again 3) It is MOSTLY finding text properly - though sometimes only on the second attempt. PROBS still include: 1) Sometimes it reads OFF the page and you have to manually find your place - esp after search.

Seriously. I understand it is still fresh and look forward to the updates since I know it's potential from the IOS version. Salli is the best voice. She has the only voice I've found on any app that sounds natural enough to get lost in the story and not get distracted by the robotic elements of the TTS voice. Once the Ivona voices are available and I can use Salli to read me bedtime stories, I can sleep like a baby and wake up with a smile :)",5,4,1.0.4,2015-10-30 00:26:46,,

Not only does it allow visually impaired users to use the ETI eloquence engine which they are accustomed to, but it also has easy, intuitive menus; supports different formats; and allows for bookshare and dropbox file imports. What's more, it also plays while the screen is locked, on first try; unlike other reading applications which I have had to struggle with in the past. Admitedly, there are a few bugs that still need to be worked out: application crashes when navigating too quickly when hitting the next button, navigation issues in certain books when using the bookmark section of the app to get to chapters. Over all though, voicedream Reader is amazing; and judging by the quality of the IOS version of this app; I don't doubt that developers will continue to improve upon this one. IN fact, I'm sure that by next year, the android version of VoiceDream reader will be equal to the IOS version. This is well worth the ten dollars, trust me!",4,0,1.0.4,2015-10-14 12:07:21,,
