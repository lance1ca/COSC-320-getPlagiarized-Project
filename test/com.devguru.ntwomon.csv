I tried it. I refuse to use an app that cant be set up quickly and is so buggy. SE worked no better than USB. Could not connect as in using the USB app. Don't waste your time trying to get this to work. 30 minutes in I knew enough this time to request a refund. They got my 8 bucks for the USB app. Not this time for another non-functioning app. Hopefully no one else will be fooled into buying this. Update: the developer has asked for the log files from SE. I have no intention of wasting any more of my time. I did send log files for the attempt with the USB app and never heard anything back from the developer. I have no other app on my phone nor my tablet that has required so much effort on my part to get it to work. I stand by my review.,1,2,,2020-08-19 07:36:34,"If you send us an email with log files, we will analyze the problem and give you an answer.

This is the first one that worked exactly as I wanted. It sees me Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e with it's native resolution of 2560x1600. I use a scaling of 250% and it looks great. Other apps always used standard display resolutions that didn't match the tablet. That resulted in jagged text and poor graphics. No such issues with Twomon SE. I use a single USB C cable and my tablet even stays charged off my laptop. The performance is not quite as fast as an HDMI monitor, but it works great for documents and web browsing. It also uses a lot less CPU on the laptop than many other similar apps. This was a lot less expensive than buying an external USB C monitor and saves weight in my bag. For a frequent traveler, that is a big deal. I cannot say enough good things about this app.",5,1,1.0.4,2019-10-03 09:25:07,"Thank you for purchasing Twomon SE.

The latency and the overall quality is great taking in account that it works over USB debugging.   It auto reconnects when tablet is put to sleep with Android Debugging Interface via AutoHotkey script and contunies to run in background so there are no interruptions. This feature can also be integrated in to program, to sleep with a hotkey or while the computer screen sleeps because it is already utilizing Android Debugging Interface.  There is a small bug where I select the full resolution of 1920x1200 of the external tablet the touch control is not responsive and targets to different points of screen instead of the intended location like when you click the scroll bar, it opens the date and time menu in taskbar.
