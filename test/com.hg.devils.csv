That's a steal for a game that's absolutely worth the full price! Like the other two games it is perfectly balanced to be challenging but beatable without buying additional money. Although you have to be careful in the beginning when you are still learning the controls. Try not to spend money on reviving, potions, or repairs. Instead, retry a level if you fail, heal up your group before ending a mission, and let your mana regenerate too. Oh, and as someone else already said, don't buy the ""level twice as fast"" addon, since you won't get money twice as fast. If there are any downsides, they are (1) rather frequent crashes, especially when picking up the game again after a break (2) sometimes horrible group placement, where the melee is blocked in the middle of the group (around level 17ish, just before you get long range crowd control, this can be devastating), (3) inability to see the enemy's AP and mana and (4) no more quests after getting the Ethereal. But I am sure a next update will address all of these issues. Recommended!",5,1,1.1.2,2015-05-23 16:00:05,,
