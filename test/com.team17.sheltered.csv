Managing your people is fun, and there is a good amount of procedural events that can mess with your attempts to maximize efficiency (not unlike RimWorld). But the controls are awful. I never know what is clickable and have trouble knowing when I've clicked it. Cycling through people is harder than it should be. I need to move my people aside so that they can use the very object they were standing in front of. Expeditions are a neat idea, but you don't get to see much of them (one of Fallout Shelter's biggest flaws). Many of the systems clash. It's fiddly to start or stop a task, and this has led me to for instance, accidentally send my little girl into the wasteland alone without a haz mat suit or a gas mask - 1. I couldn't cancel the expedition; 2. I already put her and her mother in haz mat suits, and then they took them off when going on the mission; and I didn't know that the suits don't have filters, so I didn't think to pack her a gas mask; 3. When I realized they were leaving without suits, I canceled the expedition for her mom but then had no way to cancel it for her. Placing objects you're crafting is a nightmare, because I have to find an area outside re hit box in order to move the screen to the correct area. And crafting is also odd because I have no in-game way to know where the components can be found. It is extremely hard to manage the colony's inventory. These UI issues need to be fixed. And the clashing systems. The underlying gameplay is pretty good, but the design on the surface has too many problems.",2,24,1.0,2018-10-16 14:39:33,,

The game is incredibly addictive, I'm sitting playing this over games on my PC. It is difficult and there is a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out the basics you'll realise this game has so much to offer. The controls can sometimes be frustrating, mostly just clicks not registering but that can be put down to playing on a relatively small screen. Overall definitely worth the money I  spent on it already and I'm only 5 hours in and can see myself putting in a lot more time.",5,14,1.0,2017-11-09 11:31:56,,

I love this game and I was looking for a game like fallout shelter, but based on survival. There is one thing i would add though. I would add a custom mode so the pets cannot die.
