App is great, but does have some flaws: The Q&A 
refered to in the videos is not in fact on the app. You have to get it from 
the website. The shopping list constantly crashes when using it to ""tick 
off"" items as you shop, making that function almost useless. Also, the 
shopping list (for days 1-7) tells you to get almonds and almond milk, 
rather than almonds OR almond milk. It's expensive already without buying 
things you don't need. I think it would be helpful if you could put in your 
start date on the App, so the app can tell you which day you're on. It 
seems to rely on you not looking at another days menu or at least going 
back to the correct day before you close the app. I can imagine by day 20 I 
may forget where I am. I would like to see some info/advice on what to do 
after 28 days on juice. I can imagine eating solid food again after 28 days 
of only juice will need a little transition. That said, the app is great, 
the videos are incredibly useful and informative, and I feel pretty awesome 
after only 6 days. It's just those minor things that bring it down to a 4* 
for me.",4,0,4.0.5,2018-06-02 06:22:29,,
