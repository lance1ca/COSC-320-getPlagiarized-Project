You'll find yourself constant re-entering your login info if you want to play online. Sometimes it gets caught in an endless loop and forces you to reboot the app. It's a pretty serious bug. The fourth story mode level is all out of whack and the bots seem to choose the culprit at random. Very frustrating. However, when the game works it works very well and feels similar to the board game. Hope they can resolve these issues for a 5/5 app.",3,23,2.3.5,2020-03-22 08:36:42,,

Board game play seems easier to understand. From reviews I've watched the 
digital version doesn't translate well due to AI issues in solo and the 
inability to easily communicate with other players quickly enough when 
playing online multilayer. I have played story mode and have yet to fully 
understand what exactly is going on. You have 2 hours to return after 
purchasing and it is too late now. I am honestly baffled at this point. The 
tutorial in my opinion has left me confused if not more confused as to how 
to play the Game correctly. I feel as though I'm just guessing as to what i 
need to do, and even when i think I've made the correct intuitive 
decision/choices I'm wrong until i ultimately eliminate all other options 
and win. I don't think the board game version translates well at all to 
digital. Would opt to return/refund if I could. If anyone knows of a video 
that explains the games' mechanics better than the tutorial story mode,

All in all, the game is good, art is beautiful, controls are a bit tiny, but easy enough to use. What caused me to give such a low score is the in-game AI.  I understand many of the connections between the other AI players' visions and guesses (I get a lot of clairvoyance points). My visions, however, seem extremely random, without anything tying them together. I thought it was just that round, but it has continued that way, and it's incredibly frustrating, to the point where I wish I could refund the game. I enjoy a challenge, but not random guessing.
