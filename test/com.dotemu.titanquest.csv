This game is a PC to Mobile port. The original game has not only been out for years, but has had a recent remastering. I loved it then, I love it now. 1. This is a top-down action rpg. 2. It is set in a fairly accurate Greek mythos. 3. It has one of the most fun and unique class systems I've played to date. You can have the exact same classes as someone, but have entirely different abilities. You get a second class later, and the two make a new name. :)",4,1,,2019-10-19 15:40:01,,

For years this was one of the best top-down RPG (Diablo-like) game there was on Android and it still may be to this day. The mechanics are solid and it's a great port from the original (I think) PC version but ports and revamps have it's issues and this has a few of them. The GAMEPLAY is okay, but the wonky frame rate makes making precise movements an issue sometimes. The GRAPHICS are awesome for an android port (pretty much looks like the PC version) but when you zoom out really far, it might be a little harder to see some enemies like skeletons. Maybe it's because of the small screen?  The lack of cloud saves is too bad especially for someone like me who's like switch playing it from on different devices. The weird CONTROLS is a downer since it's pretty awkward keeping your thumb on one part of the screen. An option to change the UI size and positioning would've been nice. Also, an optional tap-to-move would be very welcome. Certain commands or settings from pets were missing, just to add. Overall, this is an okay purchase. If you're looking for a decent game on Android that isn't a cash-grabbing MMO, this is a good solo only game.",3,22,1.0.1,2019-04-10 05:18:33,,

You will have to manually change your resolution in the phone settings to 720p to properly run the game. Finally, the game prioritizes picking items up instead of attacking the 35 skeletons on your ass. However there is a toggle on the left side of the screen that turns items on/off.

I never originally played the PC version but have since picked it up for PC, and it was actually one of the main reasons I bought my Nintendo Switch. The PC version is great but I mostly play this on the go, so the mobile version is my preference. Although I have a bunch of other games now, I mostly got a Switch so I could get the expansions and DLC on the go since I've played the original content on the mobile app to death. As crazy as that sounds, yes I bought a $300 mobile console so I could play more Titan Quest content. I mention this because even still, I much more prefer the phone version and I'm hoping the developer or whoever owns the rights now plan to release an update or new app with the expansions and DLC. I think most of the reviews pretty much agree, people are certainly willing to pay for it! Anyway, great game so pick it up and check it out if you haven't. Easily worth the price.. tons of content already, nearly limitless replayability, lots of choices of both classes, skill trees and equipment to suit any play style. I have logged over 300 hours on the mobile version and other than craving more content I have nothing bad to say about it. There are a couple glitches here and there, mostly visual and not game breaking or even game impacting. I've run into a few issues with my character saves, but full disclosure it's strictly because I was modding and has never happened otherwise. Couple important points which are probably already stated somewhere: this is the original TQ without any of the expansions. There is no caravan storage, no artifacts, no arcane formulas, no Dream class, and only 3 acts. Once you beat Typhon it's game over and you unlock the next difficulty. It also appears that this is prior to any fan patches (which I think was for Immortal Throne anyway) so some things fixed there still appear to be broken (i.e. debuffs from some Spirit skills, etc.) Although I haven't done extensive testing on that so I may easily be wrong.

auto-targeting system is fantastic for melee, but makes ranged play almost 
impossible. - There is a game breaking bug in the movement control that 
will randomly and often lock a character in place. These two points make

disappointed. Quests are bugged where you'll turn it in and the NPC will 
confirm you completed it and give you ""blessings of Zeus"" but you'll come 
back to the same guy and notice the yellow mark above his head thanking you 
again for the same quest. Not only that, but the controls are awful. 
Movement is really clunky and your attack button turns into the loot button 
in the middle of combat, leaving you to shuffle around to turn it back to 
the attack button. To make matters worse, I actually lost my staff for no

After running through freemium games, this is TOTALLY worth it. So much depth and quality in this one. I'm more than happy with my purchase! Would love to see a shared chest between characters.      Update: the movement is consistently glitchy. My character will just not respond to movement and that's causing a lot of deaths. The targeting of spells can be frustrating as well since you have to hold it and drag BUT if you hold too long the spell editing menu activates and too short you don't cast.   For a fast paced game, responsiveness and timelines are mission critical and this game has significant issues in that department.  Update again: Still playing and having a blast despite glitching.

It does any play job, but there's clear limitations. Rapid touches from movement to attacking, usually end up having you run directly into combat. Opening a chest as enemies approach, can be a mistake, as your attack turns to pickup item, and remains that way until you lift your finger...which, under heavy combat can often have you just standing there. I think the shortcoming is bad implementation of the click mechanism and the auto pickup drops, coupled with the attack turn to pickup...if that makes sense.   Also, autosave has screwed me, as I saved up a lot of points, because this was my first play through. Unsure of the direction I wanted to take...I regretfully invested my points in maxing the hunter mastery....and it can't be undone. **you can prevent the game from autosaving, by pressing the home key and force closing the app...DO NOT EXIT TO THE MENUS IN GAME",3,1,1.0.1,2018-02-14 11:21:30,,

No pay walls! Highly recommend over any freemium game out there.  After over 6 hours of playing my biggest gripe is the accidental healing of pets. I'm always healing my pet instead of myself as long as it's near me which is frustrating. Also in heavy battles the game struggles to register any input from me so I've watched my character sit there and get pummeled. Needing to heal or attack but nothing is happening is very frustrating.

If the developer reads this I would recommend that you do away with the action button and joystick control and go to a more traditional tap to move and attack control set. I would also recommend that you can toggle loot selection so that you don't try to pick it up during a fight. Other than that the game runs well and looks great but I am hesitant to recommend it due to the controls.   edit: I did a derp. The game does have a toggle switch so that you don't pick up items in combat. It makes the controls far more user friendly.,5,0,1.0.1,2017-03-16 23:06:10,,

I never played the PC version, so I cannot compare the two. I can only report what I've found. I have to rate the game for Android and, it has the potential to be up there with the Baldur's Gate series, Bard's Tale, and KotOR (all of which I love on Android, but also never played the PC versions - yea, I missed out on some good titles), if they'd fix a few simple problems. Sometimes, too, the character doesn't fight until you move a little first (I've died a couple times because of this, until I discovered I had to take a step or two to re-enable attacks).

That being said, it has a few hangups, namely poor framerates and some control issues. Occasionally the joystick doesn't respond, also the game prioritizes picking up loot over fighting enemies which can be annoying in a fight. In regards to framerate I'm experiencing a strange bug. Unsure if it's  only on this model, but whenever I get a notification (maybe just whenever my phone rumbles?) my framerate goes from sluggish to extremely smooth.",4,5,1.0.0,2016-07-07 00:21:27,,
