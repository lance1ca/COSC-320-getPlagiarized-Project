A classic AD&D setting in-between the part one (Candlekeep) and the sequel BG 2. The gameplay, characters, and adaptation to Android (chromebook in my case) are all pretty good, some glitches in graphics, some freezes in cutscene (doppelganger), but mostly it is good quality, decent music, and the group-NPC we can recruit (varying by our protagonists choice of class, attributes, and alignment) help to enjoy this (Goblin shaman granny is cool). The story is military flavored, and even story-mode may mean a non-combat character gets killed. Further the battle options, exp, and loot grow due higher difficulty, which some players prefer. The AI scripts are improved, and while some known issues remain (stop running against the wall, how about healing before I die?) it grants more decision making to the player. In example my ranger-stalker uses stealth frequently, while my rogue-swashbuckler focuses only detecting traps. The usage of items & healing potions was improved, but supply can run low. Many mini-quests have different themes & moods, and each NPC we can recruit has a romance, a backstory, and one quest he or she MAY ask us to help along with.

to get a positive review? Seems to be. I do not know anyone that plays D&D 
to relive the horrid behaviour of the real world. From the beginning you 
will be inundated with the refugee crisis. The crisis (which unless you 
have been in a cave with your head up your arse for a decade) has caused 
such an uproar in the world. So, every now and again I chose escape the 
garbage of both the left and right. Escape the hyperbolic nonsense. My 
neighbour is a refugee and we enjoy tea and I help build their home etc. I 
have been going to pride with my friends (no, I will not label them.) for 
30 years. I do not feel this games writer has either of those experiences. 
From the get go the game is difficult/annoying to move through. My guess is 
this is supposed to show the player how horrible the world is and the 
refugee crisis has affected all, even the BG universe. Effectively the game 
becomes unwieldy and I long to return it and get my money back. This will 
not happen sadly. I was so excited. BG is a grand universe. This is a 
disturbingly poor representation. I do hope that the developers learn 
nuance for their future endeavours.",2,5,2.5.12.11,2018-06-27 03:24:24,,

The quest are interesting, the maps are done a lot better instead of walking around in a empty map they made them smaller which was one of the best things they could have done. The side quest come in chapters so you can do them while your out traveling most can be done and a few can be done later. The main story line was a lot  longer. The way it weaves in and out while doing other quest was excellent. I would recommend  this game to anyone  who enjoys rpgs. I hope beamdog makes more rpgs even if there not related to bg.

She was my favourite character from Siege of Dragonspear and would love to see more of the romance with her.

The Infinity Engine translates extremely well to touch screen. The game it's self was really well done. My Party from Baldurs Gate imported without a hitch. I love how they got the original voice cast back for this as well. I'm really enjoying the tweaks to the IE. Like they way the scripts are listed and spell names next to the symbols.  I really hope we see more original IE content from Beamdog. Especially on Android because my favorite way to play IE games is on the touchscreen.,5,11,2.5.12.11,2018-03-08 16:04:05,Thanks for your feedback! Good luck to your party!,2018-03-09 02:40:18

As usual, the usual hotkeys work perfectly, which makes this a solid purchase for Chromebook owners and tablet users with a keyboard",5,8,2.5.12.11,2018-03-08 08:58:37,Greetings!
