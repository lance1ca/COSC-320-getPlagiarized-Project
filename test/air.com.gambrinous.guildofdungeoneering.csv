skills, skills gained from successful adventuring (max two of those) and 
items picked up during adventures. Everything resets between every 
adventure (levels and deck, but not the two skills mentioned earlier) which 
some people find annoying. I dont mind it myself since it is kind of a part

In a nutshell this game is extremely polished, fun graphics, awesome soundtrack, they must have put some capital out for the amazing voice acting, it's movie quality, wonderful music and atmosphere.  Game mechanics are tight once you figure out what your doing.  Keep your dungeoneer alive long enough, exploring and fighting to earn money to upgrade.  More often than not they will die.  But if you luck out they live and level up, becoming more powerful, which means more money on the next run.   By no means is it easy, but it sure is fun to gamble and maneuver farther around risking it all before fighting the boss.  Endless replayability, I have played a whole day and haven't scratched the surface.  So give this one a chance, and devs, keep adding content!
