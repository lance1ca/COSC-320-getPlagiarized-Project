This app is just an immitation based on the data from your camera/file. And this input data is garbage. When creating IR files, the app treats all red colored objects as warm and the green colored as cold. The actual IR data is filtered from your camera, so this app cannot guess which parts of the image are warm and which - cold. A picture of my head whith open mouth shows my face warmer than inside my mouth. Similar fot he UV immitation. Still fun.",3,21,1.5.3,2020-11-02 00:08:19,,

At best case, the app works up to ~0.85um, although 0.94um passes into the blue channel (nonideality of the light filter), but is interpreted as ultraviolet.",2020-05-23 12:37:36
