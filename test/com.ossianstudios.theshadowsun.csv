Three problems I've found so far is Google Play login shows up every time I go to the main menu - I WILL NEVER USE SOCIAL JUNK, so please make this optional (-1 star, until it gets me more aggravating, then I'll take more off). The second is there is no clean exit. This is usually a sign of using a cross-platform development system (- ½ star). DEVELOPER, please follow Android common practices and allow a clean exit (with the Back button, last I read). Lastly, the help guide is an IAP (-½ star).  I'm really looking forward to playing! UPDATE 1: Actually did an IAP, which is rare for me, so I'm committed. Still think help guide should be part of the game (or at least the basics). Forum traffic is pretty low, FYI. Raised review 1 star. UPDATE 2: Get the app, it's well worth the asking price. I'm really having fun. UPDATE 3: Raised rating to 5 stars. I've spent hours playing this game.

The one big thing missing is Bluetooth controller support. No game like this is complete without it, as it's much easier to control characters and thus relax, forgetting you're playing on a mobile device/tablet altogether. Add controller support (Moga) for that elusive fifth star! Otherwise, great game!",4,6,1.0,2014-12-01 18:34:48,,

This game is not neccassarily bad but its lacking about 4 coats of polish. The controls can be very clunky at times and there are a plethora of other issues I am not going to go into. The story, characters, and everything about this game is just so generic it's not even funny. I did not care about the characters, the world they were in, nor their quest. I warn you if you were like me and thought aha finally a serious IOS title look elsewhere this is not it. Not to be unfair and the reason I gave it 3 stars is because they could make this game a really great game with time and a lot of updates. As it stands now I would redirect your attention to Baldurs or Icewind.",3,7,,2014-11-23 12:00:50,,
