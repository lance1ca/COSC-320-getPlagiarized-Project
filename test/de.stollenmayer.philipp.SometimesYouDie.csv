I was very, very tempted to get a refund right at the end of the intro levels (the ones with the text on the walls and the storyline, but im so glad I didn't, and if you are stuck there too, or anywhere in the intro section, don't give up. The storyline, easter eggs, gameplay, mechanics, puzzle elements, communication with the creator; it all comes together to what I can say is hands down the best mobile game I have ever played, and definitely up there in the top 20-ish best games I've ever played ON ANY PLATFORM. On top of all of this, it works perfectly offline, and only costs £1.50! Absolute must-buy. Pros: - Storyline is very engaging and interesting - Outside-of-the-box approach is very unique - Frustrating at times, but not enough to make it not fun at any point - Many fun tricks and Easter eggs which are truly 'ohhhhhh' moments! - Great feel of connection to the creator - Very low price point - Works offline - Puzzle elements keep you engaged for hours, but not too difficult so as not to bore or irritate you - Minimalist design is beautiful, like a proper platformer should be - Little details that aren't needed, but are still put in just to enhance the experience a little bit more, like lights being affected by gravity, and turning off for a few seconds when you hit them as though the bulb has been broken Cons - It isn't completely free, although very cheap - Occasionally gets a little too rage-enducing (only very occasionally however) All in all, an outstanding, incredible, utterly brilliant game that I think everyone should own for those times when they are just bored and want something to do, or those times when they are ready to sit down and enjoy a good long session of gaming and puzzles. Side note to the developer: you can probably tell from what I've written just how highly I rate your game, but even still I feel it's necessary to say a personal congratulations and thank you to you for creating such an amazing experience. The fact that English is not your first language just makes it all the more impressive, and my only real tip to you, honestly, would be to make the price higher! I believe your game is 100% worth at least £2, maybe even £2.50. One final time, well done, and thank you.",5,84,1.1,2018-12-16 13:44:25,,
