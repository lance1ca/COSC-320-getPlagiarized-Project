Fruity Loops kept expanding, eventually got bought out by Cakewalk and turned into a whole big studio production thing. That's not what I need. I need a basic sequencer I can rough out ideas on to play guitar with. This did exactly what I wanted with a clean, professional looking interface that was easy to figure out.
