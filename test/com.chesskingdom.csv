She needed a little help to play. The 'catch an animal' (find a checkmate) 'battles' put her off, so she didn't progress past level 2, choosing instead to start from the beginning repeatedly. It is less intuitive than other Dragonbox apps and progress is a bit fast. The concept of check/checkmate could do with more 'learning'. Sad: checkmated king/animal is captured... needs to be un-learned for 'real' chess! Also, pieces will move (in general direction) if tapping randomly which gives false impression of no need for precision. My 8yo plays chess already so was interested to see what he'd make of it. Despite 'knowing' everything the game aims to teach, he was lured in and greatly enjoyed playing. I'd wager that he has been improving his feeling for how the pieces work together. However beyond that it won't improve his chess and he will likely complete the app within a few days. Overall a dream combination to bring Dragonbox to chess; but being aimed at pure beginners some concepts could do with being introduced more explicitly.",4,3,1.0.2,2018-06-24 17:11:29,"Hello Shahanah!
