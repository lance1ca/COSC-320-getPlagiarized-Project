The only criticism I have is that the watch face doesn't go full screen if you don't use the seconds dots that appear around the watch face.  I don't like how the second dots look, so I always have them off, but now there's just a black ring around the watch face where the dots would be.  It's not a huge deal, but it makes the bezel on my watch appear larger.  I'd love a way to eliminate the space for the seconds dots and go full screen with the watch face.

When I deleted the face from my phone the watch lasted another 6 hours on that remaining 38%.  No other change in usage, so it was clearly this app. Another issue is the steps counter was wrong.  It was over-reporting the steps by 30% compared to what other step counters reported at the same time. Finally, the watch face is not AMOLED friendly.  There is no true black background to pick, which means you can't save battery life by keeping a lot of the AMOLED pixels off. I'd request a refund if I could.

This watch face looks GREAT. Has all the features that I was looking for its a very clean look. Some of the other faces out there do look good however you find yourself looking at all the useless and battery killing animations that the display times out before you get a chance to look at the time. In my opinion this developer put a lot of time and thought into this product  FANTASTIC WORK. AND IT DOES NOT KILL MY BATTERY!,5,0,1.3,2015-06-13 00:31:12,,
