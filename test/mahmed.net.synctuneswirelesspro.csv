They were obviously still on my device, but the music player could not find them. After numerous attempts to get help from the developer with no response whatsoever, I decided to abandon this app.  I was able to get help from the developer of another app called iSyncr. They quickly discovered that SyncTunes was using a proprietary folder to store my library, so my music player could not find the music after SyncTunes corrupted the media database. Once I moved my library to a non-proprietary folder, my music player found all of my missing songs.   Based on their lack of any customer support and the proprietary programming that blocked other apps from using my library, I would not recommend SyncTunes to anyone.",1,1,,2016-03-13 20:15:48,,

I love that I was able to get my iTunes music that's on my Windows laptop moved over to my Galaxy S6  easily without much fuss. I like that this app will continue to play music while I use other apps and that it will pause when I get a call and music will momentarily mute when notification sounds occur. I like that playing music from My Library doesn't require data.  The minor thing that bothers me: the app doesn't shut off easily. I will hit pause and then use the Galaxy Close All Apps to shut it down but the icon is still in my notifications area and the apps is still open and running. I will open the icon and sometimes I'll get the pink icons that include ""Quit"" and will use that, but the apps sometimes will appear to be running in the background (for instance, I won't see the icon in notifications, but when I click Close All Apps to close some other windows I'll see this app's window included in the cascade).

This one is the real deal. I don't touch my ipod at all since I can now sync all of my music from iTunes to my phone without so much as a cable. Goes over your WiFi and Boom you got music. Be patient on the first sync if you have a large musical library as there may be a time out or two. Just restart it and it picks up where you left off.  After that it will sync up whatever you add to your library.  A-mother+,5,17,1.17,2014-07-31 19:38:38,,

I think something on the DP is causing the connection to drop (I've checked the usual suspects, screen timeout, battery modes, etc.). Though this may be a problem with my older device and version of Android (2.3.4), I think this is solvable. Unfortunately, I can't get the developer to respond -- sent email through website and the desktop app, but no response after a week.

The sync is painfully slow because I could find no option to sync by usb and the desktop program which sends all the tracks to the phone/tablet kept stopping completely part way through a sync. I'm also not keen on the design of either the app or the companion program but I could definitely live with that if the other issues were fixed,2,0,1.14,2013-07-06 15:25:57,,

The only thing I wish is that it would have synced directly to ext sd instead of to sd 0. I just had to move the synctunes folder from sd 0 to ext sd. Not hard to do but then I had to wait for all the songs to be moved. Other than that it is very easy to set up and use. I've tried others but I find this to work best even better than easy phone sync which is pretty easy to use as well. If you have a large itunes library and want to transfer it go ahead and go pro.

This does not let you assign storage location for your files.  The web site basically tells us that if the files do not end up where you want them (internal vs SD card)  there is nothing to be done as it is the phones choice.  So I transfer my first song list and only get a partial list as it quickly fills up internal storage.  I try manually copying from internal to external straight from the phone.  This works but now you have to download the next part of the list.  This is the next problem as one can not select or deselect songs from the desk top portion of this app meaning I can only re-download the same portion of the playlist.  It also downloaded the songs in no discernible order, spanning the alphabet, making this option nearly impossible even had they included the functionality.  In short make sure this downloads the song files to where you need it to or this program is useless.  Also I have had no response from there support and it has been a week.
