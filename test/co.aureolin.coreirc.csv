Free phone clients are either buggy or lacking in features. CoreIRC seems good enough for my needs. Worth the money. Since I can't find a help #,I'd suggest a few tweaks/issues to be fixed. 1) Can't seem to autocomplete/tab nicks mid sentence. 2)Time stamps of znc doesn't sync with the client. It's important. Otherwise all the previous messages from the buffer appear with the present time stamp. 3) I faced issues initially while editing the port number.",4,2,20.05wk21,2020-07-02 03:05:34,"Hey, thank you for your kind feedback. 1) The latest version allows you to autocomplete names anywhere in the chat input by typing in the @ symbol and then the first character of the nickname(s) you want to match. 2) This will be fixed in a future update.",2020-08-14 10:37:56
