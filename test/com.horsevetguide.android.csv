Positive reinforcement training techniques are used by modern animal trainers all over the world with great success. Positive reinforcement is not only about training but about changing emotions towards training. Many zoos train their animals to accept medical procedures without the need for sedation this way. There is no reason why horses can not be trained the same way.,3,1,1.2,2014-11-15 00:07:58,"We fixed the video issue (we think!) in Version 2.0.  Please email us with any problems. You need not agree w/ my approach to horse handling. However, as a life-long horseman & equine vet w/ 20+ years of experience, if I had to use food to accomplish something with a horse, I couldn't do my job. I am open to talking to you further.

Just got the Android version for my phone. It's just as awesome!  It's a must-have when caring for horses. Love the way how I can go from Observations to extensive lists of possible causes to check on or search. You don't need to know the medical terms for finding what you need: Searching ""watery eye"" will give me results for teary, running, draining as well due to a vast number of cross reference keywords.   It's not a static app you buy and are stuck with--this thriving knowledge base for all parts of horse health that grows almost daily. Beats the heck out of ""Dr. Google"" because the info is reviewed by a vet and reliable as well as complete.    You don’t need a high speed internet connection for reviewing the information and videos once you've installed it, so it’s always ready even when you're out and about. Run a sync to get the new content when you have a signal. It allows you to see directly which articles were added or updated. Very nice indeed.
