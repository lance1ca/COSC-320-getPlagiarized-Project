I had bugs that stopped me from typing permanently. Pressing one key on the keyboard would duplicate entire words, any mistyped word was just added to the dictionary automatically, and the word suggestions for misspelt words were atrocious. Like, the suggestions we're populated by things that bared no resemblance to the word I was typing. This product is so bad, I have to give up on it. Shame because I like the concept, but using it for five minutes is enough to tell you developers have no interest in realizing that idea. Minuum is a great concept but not at all well executed. I'm still using it now, but it has some issues that really, really bother me. Sliding the keyboard up and down to reveal the minimalist, single line style is great. But Minuum must have one of the worst predictive word engines I've ever seen. If you have a typo, it will consistently suggest you misspelled word to you, and the next three suggestions will also be completely wrong suggestion with typos in the a manner similar to your typo. So you need to fix it manually or scroll right through the suggestions to fix it. It's mind boggling. (For example if I type gettong, it will suggest gettong and gettibg.. which are not either of what I want.) Minuum also has a serious, serious problem with spaces. As in it is incapable of registering them. I can type out a full paragraph at times and look up to see not once space was added. Not a wrong character, like something was there instead of a space. There's just nothing. And it will happen over and over. There are other issues. There's some kind of multi-touch gesture which causes Minuum to delete whatever you were typing, so occasionally if I'm typing fast I'll notice that maybe 4 characters I just typed got chunked. Not even the whole word, ehich is super confusing, just 4-5 characters. I want to keep using it amd see where it goes because I love the single line layout, but it has issues which need to be addressed.",2,1,3.5.2,2018-11-04 19:32:27,,

Also, frequently, when I attempt to resize, it hits and holds keys instead of resizing. I regularly use the floating keyboard at near smallest size, and occasionally change size, but come to a halt when I try to resize.

I will manually type a word, and selecting it will usually add it to the dictionary. However, some words will just not pick up, no matter how many times I manually type them and then select them. The keyboard just refuses to recognize some words even when I use them constantly.  Another issue is with Chrome. Maybe it's just with my phone, but the keyboard gets very very buggy when typing in the browser. After typing a few sentences, the keyboard will get laggy, buggy, and will do weird things like double words and type in gibberish.   Besides these issues, I still love the keyboard.

The predictions seems better than google's (I switched back to google keyboard for a few weeks and had to keep correcting things myself).

While having the extra screen space is nice, I don't consider it a necessity. What I do love is how much easier it makes typing. With all of the keys being on pretty much one row, you only have to worry about horizontal movement. Because of this, the predictions and autocorrect have to be AWESOME and THEY ARE! Occasionally you will have to type something not in your dictionary, but a quick two-thumb swipe up brings out the full keyboard and you can add words easily that way.  I won't rate 5 stars because the keyboard isn't PERFECT, there is a bit of a learning curve, but if you make it past there, you'll be messaging like a pro.   I give Minuum a solid 4.5 out of 5  My only complaint would be that it seems this particular keyboard slows down my Xperia Z3 after about a day or two of use.

This is the first keyboard I've tried (out of many) that makes typing on my phone productive, removing most of the frustration. I can finally see and use most of the screen while typing, and the accuracy is far better than I expected it to be; well above normal on-screen QWERTY keyboards, at least for me. Additionally, the floating mode makes easy one-handed typing possible on my Nexus 5, something I've been missing on larger phones for a long time. Minuum has a decent number of settings, and it is easy to customize.  There's no doubt that this keyboard is different, and takes getting used to. For example, there are many helpful gestures, and they take effort to discover and remember to use.

The first thing I noticed, which may just be a case of getting used to it, is the  location of the 'Backspace' key in mini-mode. When compared to other keyboards like Swype, Samsung, iPhone, SwiftKey etc. it really seems out of place. Now I know the whole idea of the keyboard is to give you more screen real estate, but I'm using it on a Note 2, where it isn't such an issue. So I use it in 'full' mode.  The main reason I am switching from Swype, is that recent updates have rendered it laggy and buggy. Now, the main reason I use Swype is because I've tried all of the alternatives and Swype is the only one that really gets the autocorrect and prediction right! It capitalises words, brands and such very effectively, even putting accents and punctuation in to some degree.   I'll stick with Minuum, and see if it DOES in fact get better as you use it, but I think the addition of a larger dictionary with more names, brands, places etc. would put this keyboard in front of the pack.

I love the idea of this app and it works pretty well.  I've been using it for about a month.  It definitely takes some getting used to even though I already know where the keys are.  I've definitely gotten faster and better typing.  Depending on how you type, with this keyboard you may have to perform an extra step or two or three to get the letter/number/character that you are trying to type compared to a regular keyboard.  The prediction is really good as well as the gestures.  But I hate using it for user id's, passwords with multiple types of characters, addresses, urls, etc.  Anything other than a normal word is too cumbersome to do with this keyboard.  I guess for security reasons, that type of information (besides passwords) can't be part of the prediction element of the app.  This past week I found myself refusing to reply to emails because it was just too difficult and too much of a risk that it'll predict the wrong word.

After all we use it everyday if not every moment. It's an android privilege that can't be had with ios. So far my favorite is SwiftKey for its better prediction accuracy and key stroke response/accuracy. There's tons of great keyboard but overtime accuracy and how much time it saves you matters. Minuum has the potential to take typing to another level. More on-screen content and very good prediction/stroke accuracy.,5,0,,2013-08-20 11:01:05,,

Good/Amazing: Incredibly intuitive; beautiful; remarkably intelligent; surprisingly accurate.  Summary: it looks amazing, works astonishingly well, but costs quite a bit for what you're getting. Once you get over the novelty of it, it turns out to be an incredibly polished piece of software. If you have the money spare, I'd highly recommend it.   Issues: The only 'bug' [more likely a simple oversight] I've come across is whenever I correct something via the suggestions, it auto-spaces [which becomes tedious when I correct a spelling/word error I made two sentences back]. Not a big deal, but annoying.  Side note: it appears they have fixed many of the gripes early users were having in their first patch-up release, which bodes well for future development.",4,1,1.1.1b,2013-08-19 23:42:59,,

You can now properly adjust the height of the keyboard by going to the settings (we fixed this as of version 1.1.2), and you can try rotating your phone to landscape mode for more widely-spaced letters. Curious to hear if this helps!

Actually very accurate for its size and format; I even tested it out writing a few paragraphs for a short story I'm writing and it impressed me. Unfortunately, it reached its limit when I tried to type a U with an umlaut. Then I tried an acute accent and I couldn't find that either, even when switching the keyboard to show the full qwerty layout. It also bothered me that when switching to the full layout it only displays caps just like the iOS keyboard but that's just personal preference. Anyway, if you don't need those characters this should be an awesome keyboard.
