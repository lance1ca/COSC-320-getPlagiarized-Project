If something seems off then it is usually as simple as double-checking that the right inputs are being used, and I am happy to help. That way we can make sure you get plenty of use from this!

And even tho i'm not 100% sold on the new UI changes. this is a great tool!!!  (the sliders can be hard to pick precise values for, as when i lift my finger off the screen it'll change the value i was after, but this is minor.  i would prefer a drop down menu but i'll live)  I have not tried the track specific tuning, but I look forward to doing so.  I typically like to setup a generic all around setup cuz i like to play in online lobbies a lot and sometimes depending upon load times, it can be a hassle to switch between tunes.  (or have enough time to do so)  I've been able to set quite a few top % lap times on the leaderboards.  (currently doing hot hatch genesis).  I dont typically do the high end car racing.  A class max, and so far this has been working wonderfully for me.  :)",5,2,1.0.0,2018-05-15 07:13:20,Thanks for the great review and detailed feedback.

have give 1 star as there is NO aero option,tyre compound option,or tyre 
size option,but there is gear tuning and track selection hence 2 
stars(just). There are also free tuning websites which give better tuning 
results than this. Edit after developer response....thanks for the response
