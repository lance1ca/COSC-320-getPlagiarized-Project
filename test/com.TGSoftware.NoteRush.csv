Problem still occurs after reinstallation of the app. I now have to set it to ignore errors which is not good for tracking my note accuracy. For a paid app this should not happen. If it was fixed, I would give it 5 stars. *Update: Dev replied - now works with sound effects disabled to prevent reverb in room. 5 stars given. :-)",5,9,1.55,2020-11-23 04:23:34,"Hi Paul, I actually do have an update in the works with a revamped audio detection engine, but in the meantime: this issue is generally caused by the app's sound effects reverberating in the room you're in, and being picked up again by the microphone.

That's it.  No sharps/flats.    And inputting new cards is a pain on the phone.  Also, I was hoping for it showing me a line of music (multiple notes) and then letting me play them all, not queuing them up each one-at-a-time for me.      It does a good job of calibrating for the clarinet, which is nice, without more complicated notes it's a little too basic.  Why not more cards with more complicated notes?    And adding rhythm!

Found out about it from Susan Paradis.  I use it during students lessons and have them download it at home too.

Hi Rachel, I've just released an update which should dramatically improve the reliability of playing that initial middle C, as well as note detection in the game itself. I'd love to hear how you go with this new version! Let me know via www.noterushapp.com/contact-us/
