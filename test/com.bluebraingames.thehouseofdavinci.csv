Then, another issue is that any given puzzle does not necessarily lead you to the next. In other words, you may find yourself picking up pieces/clues to the various puzzles outside of the required order. So, you may find yourself solving puzzles as you get further along into the chapter, then you come across a puzzle that you are certain you are performing correctly, but it just won't work. As it turns out, there was some piece that you were expected to already have in your inventory that you somehow missed, and there is just no telling where that piece may be, and the hints are not always so clear. For example, the hint may call for you to go to a specific location or object, calling that object or location by a name that you may not be able to identify. So, you go to one of the online tutorials to help you find your way, only to realize you would have NEVER found that object on your own. I‚Äôve read some reviews where some players have complained that not all the mechanisms work; they do, but can be very specific in regard to what they need, where things can be found, and what exactly to do with these things once you have them. I would say that this is probably what makes the game so challenging, if not impossible, without good references. You will need a lot of patience to get through this game, even while using all the hints. Still, I think it is a particularly good game, but the sequel is much more intuitive and does a better job of making sure any given puzzle leads to the next in a more coherent manner, and is easier to understand where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do.",4,152,1.0.6,2020-09-17 23:21:43,,

It was extremely frustrating. Perhaps it was not meant to be played on a phone?",3,200,1.0.5,2020-02-19 04:55:38,"Hi there. Thanks for the review.

Sliding things very temperamental. Hints were often used to make sure I was doing the right thing, not find out what next!",4,66,,2020-02-03 09:27:01,,

It takes a lot from The Room series and tries to improve it. But there are a lot of problems. The most noticeable problem is with the controls. Game doesn't give a damn about what are you trying to look at or where exactly you want to move elements of the puzzle. Which is absolutely critical for a puzzle game for touch screens. One more problem is that some of the puzzles don't make any sense (IMHO). It's playable and somewhat enjoyable though.,3,70,1.0.5,2019-12-29 03:12:09,,

Sometimes that requires random tapping. Nonetheless, great game!",5,107,1.0.5,2019-05-30 04:26:56,,

It's a pleasure to look at, and I appreciate the artistry invested into the environments. Sadly, I found the game's puzzles to at best be childish, or at worst require blind fumbling to find a solution. One good example of the latter is the catapult in the workshop which requires you lob small flaming projectiles into waiting braziers. At one point, the game can't continue until a brazier is lit, but the brazier is in a darkened (and un-explorable) portion of the workshop, and no visual indications are given as to where the flaming projectile must be sent, so this requires the player to fire at random until success is achieved. Another frustrating part of the game I encountered several times is that you're unable to progress in a level without the using clues visible only through one of the two secret lenses given to you at the opening of the game, but these clues aren't visible until other steps have been finished. In theory, this is a great way to make the game more, ahem, ""puzzling,"" but in practice is massively frustrating because it requires relentless and repetitive inspection of the game environment that borders on pixel hunting.",2,37,1.0.5,2019-02-03 18:17:20,"Hi there.

Some puzzles have some originality, but many puzzles are just plain tedious and simply take trial and error... My biggest complaint by far, is terrible viewing angles/controls... Especially the earlier chapters... The way viewing angles are locked, sometimes you're forced to zoom in too far, or not far enough. And then often if you want to view the object just next to the one in focus, you often have to zoom back out 2-4 levels... Instead of just tapping on the new object. The other issue with viewing angles being restricted, is that often you aren't allowed to focus on an object until you actually need to use it... So you end up believing an object can't be interacted with, only to find out after a lengthy search or (extremely vague) hint, that there is something unusual about that object you previously weren't allowed to look at (the carved wooden pillar in the tomb is a good example) In summary: some tedious/busy work puzzles, controls, viewing angles/depths, and restricted viewing ability are all absolutely horrible... But the rest of the game besides those things is very good, and i hope the team fixes those problems (and gets a little more comfortable creatively) for their next game!",3,9,1.0.5,2018-12-16 14:46:58,"Hi there.

Developer did an amazing job with graphics and the thought into challenging puzzles, however they are not so much thought provoking, which challenge the mind. I found the challenge in not having thought a hidden compartment may be where it was. What was very frustrating, was the poor game control. Moving around and looking at tools often proved to be problematic. A great attempt of creating a better version of The Room, in that it has some great animation and story line. But it fails overall in my opinion due to poor controls and novice logic level puzzles.",4,26,1.0.5,2018-11-25 13:29:20,"Hi there. Thank you for your review, we really appreciate it.

Controls are sometimes finicky. Puzzles are repetitive and often uninteresting. Rooms are sometimes a bit too dark to see clues. The hardest part is often finding where the next puzzle bit is rather than solving anything. They finally throw in a pretty ambitious puzzle at the very end, but it was too easy to brute force the solutions once I had the gist of how it worked. Really an excellent demonstration of how much polish went into The Room to get it as good as it is.  Edit to reply to dev: Oh! Didn't mean to imply I thought it was a rip-off. It's clear y'all were very inspired by them. My issue is that you were inspired to *be* them, and can't quite pull it off.

especially after finishing The Room series. My biggest complaint is how the 
controls sometimes seem to get stuck. It's sometimes hard to infer where to 
go next in order to succeed and while Im pleased with how much that 
encourages looking upon a fascinating environment, I've gotten stuck and 
agitated before as a result. There's nothing wrong with challenging 
puzzles--just a problem of where to go next. The hint system is mostly 
helpful but it can be a little obtuse or obvious on the first hint. If I'm 
halfway to solving a puzzle I don't want to know that I have to look at the 
chest of drawers when I'm inside it and working on a sliding tile puzzle. 
That ending, guys. Please tell me you're planning on some followup or 
something more concrete because it leaves behind a feeling of clueless 
frustration and a sense that things never truly came to a head. Your human 
models are also really excellent and the movements are clean so I wouldn't

there wouldn't be a game that comes close to the ""The Room"" series. But 
HoDaVinci comes as close as I've seen. In fact, I had to double-check to 
see if it came from the same developers. The graphics are beautifully 
stunning. The gameplay, as with The Room, is challenging but not 
ridiculously hard. Hints come along at apropos times. Controls are 
responsive and sensible. I normally won't pay for a game I know nothing 
about without a bit of a taste, especially one for $5. But I went for it

creative puzzles, it is surely visually stunning and fun to look at, but I 
had tos solve the puzzles by clicking and fiddling around until the game 
decided it wanted to solve itself, I constantly had to wait for hints to 
pop up, cause I didn't know what could be interacted with and what couldn 
not... I don't want to compare and it's not fair, but I figured out the 
solutions to some puzzles but the game wouldn't allow it, cause I was not 
touching the right pixel perfect. The Room games made it clear by allowing 
the player to know the general area where you can interact by just 
activating the lens, and it was and integral part of the story, here it's 
just a gimmick. It has so much potential but it's rather flat, I only 
finished it because I paid for it. Didn't even read the story cause I was 
annoyed most of the time. I'd give it a higher rating if it had some kind 
of voice acting, cause I sure didn't want to read anything after struggling 
with the controls, (NO, THEY'RE NOT INTUITIVE, as it states in the 
description.) A patch or an update could fix a lot of these issues, I know 
it's practically asking to remake the game, but maybe there's a way to 
tweek something at least. At least for future players. Cause I for one 
won't revisit this game, I learned about unlockables at end of the game,

fairness it's kind of a Room ripoff (similar graphics, controls, puzzles,

complexity and depth of the different levels. A few complaints I have are 
that some clues are too ambiguous, some hidden objects don't provide enough 
graphic visual evidence there is something there when you closely inspect a 
given item/area, some objects requiring an item be fitted to them don't 
allow you to zoom in close enough, so it can be difficult to inspect a 
specific fitting, and some controls don't respond as well as they should 
(like one of the pipe valves you have to manipulate on the boiler supply

If you only read the reviews for buying advices, you got mine.  The game seems heavily inspired by and is quite similar to the (just as great) ""the room""-series. And yes, you do have those lenses. However, the house of da Vinci knows how to from from other's mistakes and delivered a wonderfully atmospheric game here.  The controls feel a bit unresponsive at times. Sometimes I tap on something and it doesn't work. Then I assume that thing isn't usable, walk around half an hour before using the (relatively well-made) help function only to learn that that was exactly what I was supposed to do. Then I retry and it miraculously works. But those things are minor and rare.  The graphics are average to good compared with other puzzle games at that price.  As for the story: take the story of the room only that you chase after da Vinci here. Not exactly creative but serves it's purpose.  Now what you will probably be most interested in: the puzzles. They are challenging, even if you are familiar with the genre and aren't too repetitive. Yes, you do have the common ones like ""find the lever"" or ""move that square over the whole place with touching each square exactly once"" but they are always embedded into a whole sequence of riddles in each room. That brings me to a minor thing I noticed that I didn't exactly like: In each room there is always exactly one order in which you have to solve the puzzles. I would have wished for a bit more freedom here, although I do understand that this would have made it nearly impossible for the creators to include the previously mentioned help function.  All in all I rate this game 4/5 BUT it can get 5/5 and here's how: release a 2nd part. The ending is so open that I cannot call this a 5/5 game if it just ends like that.",4,3,1.0.2,2018-04-08 12:31:57,,

up to her very quickly and we helped solve the puzzles together and traded 
phones to solve puzzles for each other that the other was having difficulty 
with. But none of these puzzles are blatenly obvious or boring in any way.

If you like Fireproof's The Room you will find it as a nice addition. Bit copied though. The OCULI for example is same as in The Room with addition of time travel. Nice but not enough of time sequences. Also a bug. I played it on my TAB S (first one 10.5) and the oculi wouldn't almost always turn on. A bit frustrating as I had to use walkthroughs to get through the gameplay in order not to loose ages to finally get it to work. Hope next one will be a bit more challenging and bug free.,3,44,1.0.2,2018-04-05 15:13:56,"Hi Tom. Thanks for the review! Regarding the oculi - you actually have two oculis on your glove.

It reminded me of The Room games a lot, which is awesome, because I LOVED those games. So this was just what I was looking for.",5,7,1.0.2,2018-03-25 16:21:55,,

When I noticed earlier that the game had fiddly controls that didn't always work, I was ready to let it slide, but after seeing how bad it gets I'm uninstalling. The eyepiece feature is just flat out broken. I shouldn't need to toggle it 10 times and change my camera angle to get a puzzle to appear. It's ridiculous. Also, when your puzzle game is based on manipulating objects via touchscreen, you MUST have good touchscreen controls, and this game just doesn't. I wasted hours on puzzles that I *knew* how to solve but couldn't quite manage to get the game's controls to recognize that I had solved.

The game is beautiful, it's not terribly hard to get a handle on, and overall the puzzles range decently from simple to ""how the hell does this work?"" (with the former usually overcome by looking everywhere and trying everything.  That said, I have two key criticisms. The first is brightness. The game is not very hard to control, but at times it's hard to know where you can go in a room, as the game is a bit darkly lit. I understand this is likely by design, but even with turning my screen brightness to maximum, I found myself not able to actually see all the places I could go/examine all that well at times, and wound up resorting to hints just to get an idea of where I was to go next.  The second issue I had was with the camera controls during puzzles. I played this on a Nexus 6, which has a massive screen, meaning it wasn't hard to see what was interactive in a puzzle. Yet because the camera doesn't lock on most puzzles, I found that at times I would go to move a piece, only to have the camera swing wildly when I missed the object's hit box (something I also found some issues with, they were hard to hit at times). It was incredibly frustrating to have to recentre the camera every few moments when this happened. While I've completed the game now, I hope this gets adjusted for new players, as I could see users with smaller screens getting very annoyed at this.  Overall, I will heartily recommend this game to my friends, though I'd also possibly recommend waiting to see if it ever goes on sale before picking it up. $6.99 CAD wasn't bad for what I got, but I'd have also liked perhaps one or two more chapters for that price. Here's to hoping for some bonus content at a later date, or a sequel, which I'd happily buy!",4,0,,2018-03-06 01:58:23,,

For example, while the puzzles we're fun and very challenging there were several instances where I would find the solution (or a hidden door) and would attempt to solve or open said door and the game wouldn't allow it...after failing several times to solve or open the secret door I would end up moving on to a different part of the room thinking I was doing something wrong only to finally give up and use the ""hint"" button (I hate using hints on this kind of game... always feels like I'm cheating)...the hint would then point me back to where I was at before and have me try the same door or solution I tried before and after several attempts it would finally let me through. I never had this problem with the Fireproof games and as such it made the game a little frustrating. One specific example I can think up off the top of my head was (spoiler alert) the wooden puzzle box on the table...I played with that box for a solid 5 minutes before giving up and figuring it was just a box I would have to place somewhere before it would open...after wandering the room for a while I gave up  and used a ""hint"" which told me to take a closer look at the puzzle box I picked up...I again spent another 5 minutes on it before I finally got the box to open up. Anyway, it was a great game and I would definitely recommend it. Storyline was fun, puzzles were difficult but not impossible, great time killer and brain teaser but for sure could use some work. I rated all the Fireproof games 5/5 stars...this one gets a 4/5 because of what I would call ""glitches"".  *Edit* Read some of the reviews below and it seems I'm not the only one with problems...I liked how they worded it better than I did though as ""the controls"".

The hints or connections from objects to objects or puzzles to puzzles could be smoother and more logical. Very often I had to rely on the hint as I find it hard to make the connections between puzzles as they were at times pretty random. More usage of daily life objects in the designs of puzzles may help to bridge these connections instead of tonnes of uniquely designed objects that we are seeing for the first time.

The game play with this one is a little less enjoyable and a lot more frustrating, for me at least; one of the puzzles giving me trouble had a reset button, thank goodness, but I wish others had. By the time I looked up a walkthrough on some of those I'd made such a mess of the puzzle that I had to start the chapter over just to get a blank slate to follow the walkthrough from. Many puzzles seemed to involve a lot more random luck than logic, and for many of them I still have no idea how I was meant to figure them out without a walkthrough video or what some of the clues or symbols were supposed to mean. Many of the controls were also really difficult... that pump with the sliding and rotating handle had me about ready to quit the game, I was so frustrated just with trying to make it move properly. Did manage to get to the end but never would have without the help of the Internet. Ending was a bit of an anticlimactic but obviously is just the setup of a sequel, so not a real disappointment for me. (Is it sad to say I was just glad I was done struggling with these puzzles? :D) I hope with the next game the developers will strike out on their own more without so much direct and pretty blatant copying from The Room; this is obviously a talented team, I hope they'll trust in that and infuse the next game with more of their own concepts and style. Either way, I'm sure by the time the next game comes out I'll have forgotten exactly how much this one frustrated me and be ready to go for round two. :D",4,0,,2018-02-05 00:18:04,,

I actually think the overall quality of the game is much higher than The Room. It has characters, pretty convincing animation, more believable and logical mechanisms, more plot, better aesthetic structure (but see below), and the puzzles are more varied - and some of them I thought were quite ingenious. Also, the difficulty curve was more obvious, with the last few chapters beginning to feel more challenging! (in a nice way)  Yes the ending was a let down. May I give my advice to the developers: simply make the cutscene much longer! (and/or consider adding an epilogue room) You can end on a climax, or ramp down after a climax using e.g. the golden ratio. But - if there is an anticlimax, and you end then and there, it isn't a fulfilling aesthetic structure! It's really much more complicated than that, but that's just on simple terms to be getting on with. Anticlimaxes have epilogues. Source: I am a classical musician.",5,0,1.0.0,2018-02-04 10:35:10,,

Puzzles are direct lifts and not very engaging. Controls are clumsy. Plot is The Room 1 with name changes (follow handwritten notes from old man scientist through building while trying to find secret experiment before the baddies following you, while unlocking puzzles, then jump into a portal/gate) .  Feels flat and unexciting. Hints pop too quickly, finished in two sittings and felt like I'd achieved nothing. Looks blooming beautiful, don't get me wrong, if a bit dark.  Knicked 'lens' mechanic from The Room with rubbish attempt at justification, did like the time-lapse though, that was new.  Gutted, as I really wanted to enjoy this as much as I enjoyed Room 1-3. Unfortunately it's a really good looking book, with no new content, and the controls and plot are poor enough to hinder enjoyment.  The puzzles are less time manipulating the items, and too much running between rooms/platforms. The lovely animation quickly becomes a tedious ""let's watch this unskippable slow-walk on rails another 40 times""  Also, a notebook or scratchpad option is required. Some puzzles require you to copy information from one location to a location that it's not visible from. People playing on their phones will not always have a separate pad of paper no more things on, just add one in game, or have automatic notes populate when the clues are revealed.  At a higher cost than The Room 1-3, get them first. This is a pale shadow, but shows promise for future games from BB if they build on what they have. Not bad at all, but the series they used as 'inspiration' is far superior, and cheaper.  I'll still get the sequel when it arrives, expecting good things.",3,0,1.0.0,2018-01-06 04:37:40,,

I say challenging meaning the solutions take some hard thought, strategy and sequenced use of tools, but they ARE solvable with what you have been given (with a couple minor, frustrating exceptions I won't mention due to spoilers). When you have solved some of the more complex ones, you feel like you've actually accomplished something, as opposed to just checking off requirements that are internal to the game. The graphics are super and reflect a lot of effort and thought so I found them more interesting and in fact more beautiful than those in the Room series.

Yes, it was probably inspired by The Room but nothing wrong with that and it is in the same league without question. Graphics are smooth and beautifully rendered. Story line is excellent, the factual content about Leonardo is a bonus and nice touch.   Puzzles are plentiful, varied and with a good range of difficulty. This makes the game long enough to be easily worth the money. The only (slightly) negative comments I have are:  Some hints don't really help; they just state what is obvious about the puzzle not how to tackle it, Sometimes the controls are tricky to manipulate, e.g. you might want to move a handle horizontally but it has a big tendency to go vertically. But this is meant more as feedback for the developers - don't let it put you off trying the game.  Great job, looking forward to next release.",5,1,1.0.0,2017-12-25 16:36:50,,

Items need to be pointlessly-yet-specifically manipulated (keys turned, screws screwed, items facing just the right way before they'll join) and with a phone screen and fat fingers, I occasionally want to throw my phone down. It's especially frustrating when I know the solution to a puzzle, but I cannot manipulate the items in the proper way. It wouldn't be so bad if the controls were responsive, but they're not. Things don't always lock into place - swipe too hard, you overshoot; too soft, nothing happens. It's enough to make me want to stop playing, which would be a shame as it's a beautiful game with decent puzzles.

When you give up and use hints (which you will) the hints leave you in a ""and how the hell was I supposed to figure that out"" feeling. There is a lot of trial and error with this one. Solutions are still satisfying but more than a few solved puzzles don't give you a feeling of accomplishment using hints after your left with nothing to go on.

Also, control on a phone is difficult, as often the background moves as well as the actual bit you're trying to control.  I got as far as the sphere in Chapter 3, but just couldn't get the things the right way round.  I can't be doing with the rest of the game if it's as monotonous as this, so I'm reluctantly giving up.  What would be really great would be a skip button, so if you really get stuck on a puzzle, you can still move on.  The hints tell you what you need to do, but not how to do it.  Edit:- Thank you for your response.  I've finally managed to get past the cabinet in Chapter 3, and now appear to be out in a courtyard.  I may continue for a bit to see how things progress, but this game is as frustrating as it's enjoyable, and at the moment, there doesn't seem to really be any aim to the game.  As I previously said, a skip button would be welcomed.  Also, it would have been nice to have had a trial available before paying for the game.  Edit: 15/12/17 - I finally managed to complete the game, but only with the help of a YouTube walkthrough for some of the parts.  I have now given an extra star, simply for the graphics and the way that the game operates smoothly and with no lag.  The ending was a bit unrewarding after all that effort, but strangely, even though I hated the game as much as I liked it, I'm slightly disappointed that it's over, and would probably be tempted to torture myself with a sequel, but my points above still stand, with reference to a skip button and a trial version.",4,0,1.0.0,2017-12-15 14:37:07,"Hi there.

My ONLY gripe is the number of times I KNEW how a puzzle should be solved....to the point of knowing exactly how to move something only to try and try and try, but because of either incorrect zoom into a specific part of a puzzle or an object not responding to my touch gestures it made me assume I was barking up the wrong tree. When I then query the hint system I yell internally ""I JUST TRIED THAT!!!"" I'm fairly certain I could've beaten this game if only it were in real life and I could grab/touch things the way I physically wanted to. This is merely a technical fault though. I will admit I am used to puzzle games with cues as to things you can touch or move and you don't get any of that with this game, which is totally fine, but perhaps next game let users decide a difficulty. One where you get cues or sparkles for things you can interact with. You don't need to give away how the object should move or what to do, but just that it has the potential to be interacted with either at that moment or at a later time. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS:::::::: example - the picture above the fireplace that requires a corner of the frame to be moved......i was touching and moving every single corner in every single direction and nothing happens. I knew one of those had to move, but I HAD to zoom in on the one that moves.....very deceiving! But I wanted to make sure this was clear to the developers because telling them the ""controls are wonky sometimes"" isn't helping to fix these issues. Thanks for an amazing game though!

So I love this kind of game and consider myself to be at least competent at them. This game is strikingly similar to the Room. However that is not a bad thing. I have thoroughly enjoyed the game so far and am ready to see where the developer takes it. That said the controls are a bit off. But I had the same issue with the room and that did not stop it from being in my top 5 mobile games of all time. I feel that this series will also join that list.

But so far the graphics are great, the puzzles are at a good challenge level for me, and I am engaged by the story.  In comparison to The Room, the controls are a bit clunkier (moving objects doesnt feel quite natural) and it has less of that creepy, supernatural feel I liked in The Room, but on the other hand the story seems to be more robust and there are actual rules/explanations for how the eyepieces work.  A really satisfying ending will likely bump this game up to 5 stars for me, definitely a contender at or above The Room and possibly Myst.  Time will tell!  Update after completing the game:  the puzzles could be extremely difficult at times, particularly the ones that require you to discover several random-seeming pieces of information and putting them together in the correct sequence.  Once I started taking copious notes and screenshots like I did in Myst, I was able to get through things much more easily, and I finished the game in under 5 hours.

Great concept, great graphics,  excellent puzzles all mixed together to give that air of wonder and although it doesnt quite reach the creepyish aura of the aforementioned Room series,  it certainly gets closer than any other game.  Well done and will look forward to any more releases!!",5,2,1.0.0,2017-09-21 05:49:28,,

One nice touch is that as you work your way around you can collect designs for some of Leonardo's real inventions and as you do each of these becomes available as a playable working model in the 'Achievements' room (see video).  I think my favourite puzzle was near the end where you have to find the right settings on a complex machine, and it seems as though you don't have enough information but then suddenly it all drops into place.  There's a good hint system, which is often useful if you simply don't know which object you should have examined more on a large level, but sometimes it's a bit to keen to pop up and I think a longer timeout before it offered a hint would have been good. I did try turning it off but found that more frustrating. (However I still think Lumino City has the best hint system).
