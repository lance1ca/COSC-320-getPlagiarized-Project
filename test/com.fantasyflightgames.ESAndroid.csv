The expansions play more like a campaign over 2-3 games.    As for the moronic reviews regarding ""luck""... This game surpasses the pithy label of luck. Dice are meant to be random but it is so much more about which investigators you have and which ones are suitable to play for each adventure. There's a subtle risk factor: do you waste cards and win an adventure or elect to lose the adventure keeping your cards? Cards can give you more advantage, but sometimes its just wise to stay in the entrance when the clock is about to strike midnight. You can play slow but the game will catch with up with you.

My friends play Eldritch Horror and so I was quite excited to see an Android game from the same series. On first play, it was extraordinarily difficult, and all my investigators died (which, if you're not familiar with the series, this is sort of the expectation -- it's hard!).   However, on replaying the game a few times once I understood the rules, the meaning of the symbols, and how to use the investigators, I've now won almost every game. The mechanic is actually ultimately very simple and luck-driven rather than skill-driven. Ultimately I feel somewhat disappointed because after 10 plays in ~5 days I basically get it, and I think I am playing very close to optimally. There are of course expansions, unlockables, etc, but for a $4 game I expected more replay value than this.   The visuals and graphic quality are excellent. Sound / music OK.  The developers left out some obvious replay value tricks -- there are high scores, but basically no achievements (you can unlock 1 additional investigator by winning at the hardest level).

You randomly get glyphs that are used to match against challenges. To assist you you must pick a team from either glyph changers or additional glyph special powers pool.  Even when choosing well you don't always get the right glyphs.  Not like chess.  Not like craps.  Some where in the middle... where it drives you mad.

Closest I've ever gotten is 6 signs on Yig, the easiest one. No point in even trying the others yet! Frustrating as hell but can't help playing it and loving the look and feel. I'm sure it's rigged though, as you never seem to get the glyphs you really want! Only 4 stars though as it does feel very unbalanced - the players always need more signs than there are doom 'points'.",4,1,1.4.3,2015-07-28 09:03:20,,

I have made up my own rules for it where only one faction goes after the boss and fights the map/quests and the end boss chosen.

Reading through the reviews, I wondered if I'd be disappointment, but I'm extremely pleased with this purchase. Let me address the two primary concerns raised in reviews... [1] TOO DEPENDENT ON LUCK? There is a big ""chance"" element in this game. But there are many strategic choices to be made by the player as well and they have tremendous effect on whether you win or lose. Once you get the hang of it, you begin to understand how you might be able to beat something that previously seemed impossible. [2] TOO HARD? This is not a game you can just pick up and play, and that usually turns me off. But I read through all the help info (twice) and watched some online video as well. The investment was worth it!

Cons: All luck.  There is little or no planning or tactics.  The random generation process is biased at best.  If you play this game, you will lose every time.  I am an avid gamer and bought this game based on internet recommendations.  Sadly, the ""random"" glyphs that are needed to complete each mission are almost always slanted against you.  Often with 6 random glyphs, 5 of 6 all will come up with the same icon and the last icon is less than useless.  Even if you only need 1 glyph to complete a mission, you will likely burn through all of your options for little chance of success.  Investigators often die or go insane, and unlike the table top game, no new investigators come to replace them.  In short, you will not win this game ever and it becomes an exercise in frustration.

It could be a great game but it's not. There is no skill involved in this game it all comes down to dumb luck and a random number generator that is so against you that the game isn't fun. Who wants to play a game where all you do is loose and it does not matter how good you play it you are still going to loose because the whole game is geared against you.

The former had a lot more depth, but the latter has faster play and is more suited for a mobile conversion. But there are a number of faults that keep me from giving more than an adequate 3-star rating.    First, if you haven't played the dice game, this game is boggling for a new player.  There are tutorial videos, yes, but they make a lot of assumptions.  For example, it dives right in to explaining glyph locking, without explaining what a glyph is.    Second, it is next to impossible to predict the odds of success for any given adventure.  In the dice game, you can physically count the glyphs on the dice and make an educated guess.  It wasn't until my third game that I discovered that the red die is much more powerful than the green or yellow dice.  Third, the game lacks flavor.  The dice game has much less flavor text than Arkham Horror, but it has some and it doesn't appear in this conversion.  Fourth, the mechanics are quite opaque.  I often had no idea where doom counters came from.  Fifth, the videos were corrupted on my touchpad.  Finally, only Azathoth is implemented.",3,5,1.0.4,2011-12-07 17:19:02,,
