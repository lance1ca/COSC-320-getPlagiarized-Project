The Developers have not addressed this issue and it continues on in this fourth installment and I am very sad that day have chose to not fix this bug. Before this the games were very enjoyable but now they are on unplayable. Developers please fix this bug in all your sorcery games. Thank you,1,8,1.0,2016-09-22 19:44:11,,
