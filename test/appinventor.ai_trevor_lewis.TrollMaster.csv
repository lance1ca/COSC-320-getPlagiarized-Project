It also has various lead core lines on there which is awesome. It seems like the developer is constantly updating the app and adding new lures and lines which speaks volumes of the developer. I already asked him a question and got my answer in 5 minutes. Cant wait for updates!!,5,6,9.1,2019-09-14 06:45:51,,
