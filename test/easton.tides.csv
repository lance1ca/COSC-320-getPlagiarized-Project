The app will calculate tides for any date in the future, unlike many tide apps which only give tide times 7 days in advance (which are already widely available on the web).  The developer is quick to respond positively to any feedback.",5,4,4.1,2019-04-11 01:31:56,,

Delighted. I live on Isle of Wight where tides are very complex and have found over the years that UKHO predictions are the most accurate for the Island. So I wanted an App that showed those predictions, in both table and curve format ... and version 4 of this App does just that. The App is also easy to understand and use. Highly recommend.",5,4,4.0,2019-03-19 10:12:36,,

Intuitive & easy to interpret, with excellent coverage in my area of France. Demands no permissions beyond knowing your location. Another reminder that paying for an app not only directly supports the developer, but prevents YOU & your data from being the product.
