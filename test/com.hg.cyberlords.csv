I may play through BG1 one more time and if BG2EE still isn't out I will put more time into Cyberlords. Either way Cyberlords is on my list of games to finish. Imagine Baldur's Gate set in the future released on Sega Genesis. That is the feeling I have from this game. The gameplay is just like Baldur's but in the future. I love this retro feel to the game but at the same time I think it would be cool for any sequels to offer a bit more graphically. The game does has it's flaws but they are minor (at least the ones I have come across) and none of them so far seem to be game breakers. I have only put about an hour into this game so far and so far the only main complaint I have (which may be resolved when I am farther in the game) is the quests seem to be short. So far I get a quest move maybe one map over and bam there is the solution. Every game of this type though sort of walks you through at the beginning so I have hope that this will change farther down the line. When I have put more time into this game I will come back and adjust my review as neccassary if I feel it even is.,5,2,1.0.3,2014-05-11 06:58:27,,

The lack of a minimap and/or map zooming is a minor nuisance, but not enough to be problematic. Unlike so many ""real-time"" games, this one has a toggle for ""tactical mode,"" which is basically ""pause and give commands,"" so the player has a great deal of control over how fast combat resolves.
