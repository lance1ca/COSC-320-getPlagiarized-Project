That sums up 10000000 (Ten Million) in a nutshell. Slide tiles around with wrap-around and try to match items as quickly as possible to deal damage to enemies and stay on the screen. Slide off the left side and you lose. Get to the little checkered line on the right and stay ahead of it for a real rush: You start a counter of a certain resource, such as EXP or Gold. Stay across long enough for the counter to fill and you get that value of resources. Fall back behind the line and poof, they're gone. The graphics work well for what it's trying to be. The music... well, I'm slightly amazed that the main theme of the game is Creative Commons licensed, but it's awesome. For $2 you just can't go wrong. Only gripe is that acquiring gold was a little tedious at times. That improved once I rose in rank. That gripe isn't enough to make me deduct any ★s though. In short, if you enjoy blazing-fast Match-3 games, get 10000000.",5,0,1.2.47,2013-04-08 15:55:50,,

The developer (a single individual) was then asked by the Android community for a port.  This occurs many times, and it's a shame that many Apple developers (many of whom have use of entire teams, and not a single person) choose not to do so, as it's simply ""too hard.""  This developer however, has sacrificed much of his free time (mostly by himself), in order to bring an awesome game over to our side of the fence.  The game itself is intuitive, insanely fun, and rabidly addictive, but even if it weren't, the customer service (and determination) of that magnitude is worth incredible respect and (at the very least) $1.99.
