After all those bad reviews and emails from paying customers such as myself you have done nothing since August 2019 to fix the sound problem. It's 2021. You sent me an email saying that you are working on the issue. I guess you just took our money and never did anything. It's a pitty because it is actually a good app. Please fix the problem.
