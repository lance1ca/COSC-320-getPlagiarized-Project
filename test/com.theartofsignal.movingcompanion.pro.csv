The location section should have drop down selections such as kitchen, bedroom 1, living room, etc. There could also be some drop down options for box content, such as dishes, cups, etc. I also wish I could copy the name of a box. For example, I don't want to keep typing in dvds 1, dvds 2,  dvds 3 etc if I have several boxes of dvds. This is very time consuming. I will continue to use the app for now, and will adjust my review if options improve.",3,0,1.3.0,2017-10-26 23:50:35,"Thank you  for your feedback!
