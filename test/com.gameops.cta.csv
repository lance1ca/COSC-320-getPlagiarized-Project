Like everyone says if you close the game and come back later you need to start a new game. I wouldn't pay the $7 for this game. It feels more like a $1.99 game. Hope the game gets updates because it is fun but at the same time your left feeling .. like it could have been better.,2,14,1.6,2020-11-28 03:20:48,,
