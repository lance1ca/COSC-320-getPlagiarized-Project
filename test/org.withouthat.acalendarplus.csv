Quick response from the developers that solved the issue. Back to 5 stars. This has been overall the best calendar app I have found over several years and trying out 4 or 5 different apps. THANKS!,5,2,2.2.1,2019-08-03 07:59:20,When you experience problems please contact our support with details through the app (menu - help). This problem can probably fixed by turning off HTML formatting in the event editor settings (it's probably off in your free version). Can you please send us details about the content of the description field for events where this problem occurs?,2019-07-31 13:51:38

However, to the developer: Think about your paying customers. People who paid for this app have grown used to the interface, and to their customizations. When it is changed without warning, they lose the smooth flow of the software; it becomes an impediment, and an aggravation. Not everybody wants to spend a half hour picking through the changes and re-customizing everything. When your app becomes an irritant instead of a familiar, smooth workflow, users are going to get upset.  Replying to complaints with surly criticism, telling users they're wrong, only further irritates them. The release process was done badly, and snarky replies to comments don't help. People who pay money for a product expect the product to behave consistently.  If you make a major change to the UI, the old interface should remain available. The option is often called ""Classic"" or some such. That way, users can work with the look-and-feel they're used to, but can also switch to the new look in order to get familiar with it. A little courtesy, and giving some thought to your users, will go a long way toward maintaining customer loyalty.",4,14,2.0.1,2018-12-06 10:45:43,"Thanks for the feedback.

This is one of the best calendar-based application on the market!  While managing a college work load with a hectic schedule, I needed a calendar app that could help effectively manage my schedule. I started out using the free version in 2015 and enjoyed how the app creates a user-friendly and accessible calendar. What won me over was the ability to create events with specific times, durations, locations, attendees, etc.. I later transitioned over to the premium version that includes the task app (highly recommend) which works well in conjunction with the Calendar app. With both of these apps helping to organize and coordinate my payments, finances, social time, studying, working, and time with family, I have been a fan of aCalendar ever since!  The calendar app excels at offering variety  with how the time intervals for notifications (6,12,18 hour, etc.) and repeat events  (daily, bi-weekly, etc.) are set. It works effectively at being very customizable with both the color palette on the Task and Calendar app. Likewise, the offline performance and cross synchronization between calendars and devices are a major bonus. This app is excellent for anyone needing to effectively organize their time and visually map out their schedule.   I would recommend in the Tasks app giving each ""tasks entered"" the option for a reminder alarm (similar to how the Calendar app offers this for when you are creating events). In the premium Calendar app, adding a wider color palette (more than 12 colors) in the ""add event"" menu would offer more customization and  improve on what it greatly offers.

Have tried a number of them and they end up being too complicated and cumbersome for my needs.   Like most people,  there are always things you would like to see,  but you can't please everyone.   All I needed was a to do list with dates and times that was easy enough to manage that I could get rid of the paper list.  I can add things to this one in seconds and without having to punch a hundred keys or refer to a cheat sheet to remind me how the silly thing works.   Plus it's a nice clean looking little widget that sits in the corner and plays nice (so far)  with other apps and my version of Android!   And I can easily read my daily schedule without having to open it.   I ended up paying the $5 and getting the full plus version.  A good way to support a good developer and keep improvements coming.   Even if I don't use all the features, I get rid of ads,  which I hate.

Crisp, clean, and functional.  I did have an issue with it trying to sync one account I don't want sync'd, and I about pulled my hair out trying to get it to stop.  But then rebooting the device fixed it, so I'm guessing it was an OS glitch, not an aCal glitch.  My only real gripe about this one is that the swipe left/right and swipe up/down seems backwards to me.  I'm used to swiping left/right to move in time (prev/next week/month,etc.) while on aCal swiping left/right changes the view and swiping up/down moves you in time.  Other than that though, I love it.

But, the point I  want to impress on prospective users, is that this app strongly favors and is geared towards those who schedule lots of appointments. If your primary use is tasks, you are likely to be disappointed. On most of my days, I have many tasks for the day, crammed into a small corner of the screen, while 80% of the screen (the hour by hour appointment portion) remains blank. I have to click on the task to read the full title. Then, when I go to the task list page, I see all past, present and future tasks in one giant long list. A default 'task view' option would improve the app greatly. I'll add 1 star.",3,3,1.4.6,2015-11-08 10:53:20,There's even a dedicated launcher icon to go straight to tasks or you can place the tasks widget on your home screen to show tasks and link to the tasks view.,2015-11-09 01:21:23

It's easy to use, syncs with Google calendar, is well thought out, and unlike some of the calendars out there, it doesn't seem over done to the point of impracticality.   My one nitpick about this app is that the text on events seem to run together and have awkward line breaks, mainly on the weekly view, which happens to be my preferred way to look at the calendar. If they at least had a border around them to separate them from other events, it would be much easier on the eyes. The calendar widget is only really practical for me on ""day"" view for this reason. Re-sizing the text helps only so much on the other views. I realize it's difficult to fit a lot of information in the spaces available, but lesser calendars have managed it.   This is not a lesser calendar, however, which is why the weird formatting of text is far from being a deal breaker.

A few features could still be improved: * Nice if widget could list unscheduled tasks at top * For calendar's week layout, I'd find it more intuitive if I could select horizontal matrix when in landscape and vertical matrix when in portrait. * Syncing isn't as responsive as I'd like. I often use different devices and I appreciate that it would use up too much battery/bandwidth to poll changes all the time, but would be nice if every change on the device triggered a sync. When in tasks, does requesting an explicit sync also sync calendar, and vice versa? I'm not sure. * In day view, long press on a time allow to create a task whereas long press on the space where tasks show only allows to create an all-day event, not a task. I think it'd be more intuitive if you could create a task from where they are displayed. * When selecting multiple tasks, the only action that one can do in bulk is to delete them. I often want to reschedule several tasks at the same time. It would be nice to select them all and then reschedule them to another day.",4,1,1.0.2,2015-01-13 13:50:04,Sync is separate for calendar and tasks. Calendar sync is handled by the cloud service's (e.g. Google Calendar) sync adapter and should operate in PUSH mode. Tasks should also push local changes. The idea of directly creating a new all-day event in that area is to save 1 tap - asking the user what to do there would defy that purpose.,2015-01-14 04:30:13
