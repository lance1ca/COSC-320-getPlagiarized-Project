Do you have any idea why can't I Import slow motion video captured by Pixel 4? When I Import it the app just closes itself. Otherwise looks good. Edit: The creator suggested to try with another gallery app and check again.,5,2,2.0.1,2021-02-03 03:32:03,,

Additionally, despite jump height being validated, and peak power possibly being ok too based on flight time and weight, I don't think peak force and peak velocity results would be accurate. If you can use this app alongside a velocity tool, you could probably work out the force value and vice versa if you had a force measuring tool.",3,10,2.0,2020-07-18 14:53:41,"Hi James, thanks for using the app! Unfortunately that's how Android works; in some models/versions you can do it, in others it is not allowed and you need to record outside the app and import (accuracy will be exactly the same). As for the force and velocity values, it's MEAN, not peak, following Samozino's validated equations. Thanks",2020-08-19 00:59:57
