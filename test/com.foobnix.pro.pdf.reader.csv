There is no widget on either of my two devices, but the app has settings for a widget. The css is not rendered correctly. They give you the option of document only, document and user, user only. None of these are honest, there is more going on that they are not admitting to. None are accurate. They give you a box to write in your own css, but it doesn't work, at least none of the several things I've tried works. They give you the option to make different profiles, which change the UI. I made one for night. It doesn't find the books on my reader, making it useless. THERE IS NO HIGHLIGHTING. No highlighting and coming back to your highlighted areas. Even bookmarks don't highlight so you have to read all the text on the page to find what you wanted to highlight. If you want to highlight, you need a different app. (Lithium is good for highlighting and css, but lacks just about everything else.) Ambitious and one of the better reading apps but still very wonky and worst of all, developers who completely ignore customer emails. Maybe have abandoned the project. There are a lot of epub readers, but most of them are really bad. We NEED some good ones. This one has a lot of potential. I wish the developers would come back and improve this app or give it to someone who will.",4,0,8.3.100,2021-02-07 07:41:03,,

It has been a long time since there was an upgrade but these bugs are being worked on.  1. The program will often forget where you left off reading the book. You can work around the bug by remembering to leave a quick bookmark. Irritating when you don't get the chance to leave the bookmark but it is workable.    2. Will sometimes fail to render a page with an error message. You can work around it by going back 2 pages and then forwarding it to where the error occurred.    These bugs are significant but not fatal. Even with these bugs this is the best ebook reader. Hopefully these bugs will be fixed before some other app steps up and surpasses the functionality of LibreraPro.,4,4,8.0.39,2019-05-27 13:38:14,"Thank you for feedback, please try beta.librera.mobi 1) is fixed 2) in progress 3) also sync was added.",2019-05-28 11:49:06

It reads files.  That said, I have run into a few quirks and wish this otherwise stellar app had some additional functionalities. Being able to apply RTL and LTR reading on a file-by-file basis would be incredible for those of us with manga in our libraries, such as myself. For starters, the loading times are anything but good. It can take up to a minute for the application to load a file and start reading. Secondly, the app seems to have inconsistencies with files. I use the same program and format for all my ebooks, and carefully ensure that the credentials are correct. However, Librera Pro will occasionally: display the name of the file instead of the title of the book entered; not display the author; not display the cover icon of the file. Sometimes the files display everything properly, then randomly lose elements upon restarting.  Overall it's a decent app that does what it says and can read a plethora of e-book file types, but be aware it's not completely polished. 7/10",3,3,7.10.41,2018-10-30 17:19:49,Please contact us by email we can fix everything together.

Being able to hide the tabs at the top is fantastic. Librera met all of my 
mother's requirements: simplicity, the right colors for Night mode, ability 
to change the font size. There is one strange behavior. If I have favorites 
as the left-most tab, then the folders tab, and some other tab next to 
folders, when I tap a favorite folder, the app hops over to the tab which 
is to the right of the folders tab. The folders tab will have the right 
location, but it is strange that Librera seems to prefer any other tab that 
is just to the right of the Folders tab. In my mother's case, I limited the 
tabs to Favorites & Folders. I would have liked to have Recents too, but 
the behavior was too confusing and annoying. If I have other tabs, I have

Should have known better than buying before trying. Don't know if it's just compatibility problem, but displaying pages is really slow on my Galaxy Note II. Also, I can't find any quick buttons for zooming to fit entire page, or zooming to fit width. The lock is a good idea, but kinda useless as I don't seem to be able to zoom in with lock on. I ultimately want the pages to lock to either full page or full width while scrolling, but be able to zoom in to read, then go back out to full page or full width for scrolling. This app doesn't seem able to do that. As it is, if it's unlocked to zoom in, then it's also possible to zoom back out too far and have the page too small with excess blank screen showing, as well as zoom out and have the page oriented too far to one side or the other with excess blank screen showing.

With more slick rendering and UI tweaks this would be top pdf reader,but even in its present form easily replaces the adobe product. Well worth the small purchase price.(edit)only disappointment is of late the app is getting a bloated size and much slower so dropped**",3,0,3.3.0,2012-11-24 17:27:27,,
