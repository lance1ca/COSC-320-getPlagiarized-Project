the Android platform, even on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. It's too easy to 
mistakenly spend your coins on trees that destroy the vagrant camp or just 
as bad sending your builders to their deaths just because you wanted to 
move your King out of harm's way. Another issue is the sh*tty A.I. : Before 
ppl come to the developer's defense, I will say that there are mechanics to 
the game that are challenging to begin with--but they could have improved a 
lot on the overall efficiency of the A.I. Sweeping the issue under the rug 
and saying ""well, that's part of what makes the game efficient.."". 
No..nooo..just, no.. Too many times.es I've watched units stand idly by 
while two or three more giant greeders undo hours worth of work. It's a 
poor excuse for not developing a better A.I. plain and simple. I definitely

I hate the way you are constantly dropping coins when trying to move. This has led me to cut trees down where I didn't want to which can ruin your strategy for example if it was the last treatment preventing a peasant camp from disappearing. Why can't the screen be split into 3 with taps and swipes on the left and right side for movement and taps in the centre for dropping coins?

Very polished. As you play, the difficulty increases, for those that like a challenge. That said, the feature that most ties the game together(in my personal enjoyment) is the amazing soundtrack. The loneliness you feel, as your horse grazes away from safety, is fantastic. You are but a King.",5,13,1.2.5,2017-03-12 13:52:44,Thanks for the review and kind words Alex. :),2017-03-12 14:01:48

Horse needs some kind of stamina indicator. So easy to die because horse will rear up instead of running, and you'll unfairly lose all your progress. Some kind of persistent rewards would be nice. All you do is ride a horse left or right, sprint whenever it decides to let you, and throw coins at stuff. That's it. The nice sounds and decent visuals earn it 3 stars, but this game is not worth the steep $7 price tag.

My only criticism is that the instructions aren't clear for playing on a tablet. I was able to figure it out (they're simply), but it would be nice if the intro screen was customized for tablet play rather than a controller. For those that don't know, holding the bottom left or right portions of the screen will move the monarch to that direction. Double tapping will make the horse run. Touching the screen above these areas will drop coins. Touching and holding will continue to drop coins (for building/upgrading). Overall, I enjoy this game a lot.",4,7,1.3.0,2016-10-06 08:34:23,"Hi Cameron, that is actually a bug. The game only supports playing with a controller for now.
