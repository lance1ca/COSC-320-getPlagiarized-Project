Limit by frames, limit by this and that.... Just have one setting for unlimited.  If people fill their memory, that is a n00b problem.  I lost some epic time lapse because the app shut down on its own.  Have a setting for unlimited, for us that use it daily, we know our phones memory and if we go over, it, it's is our own fault.

It's editing capabilities are amongst the best I've seen, with full control over frame rate, video output size with a modest choice of codecs. You can also add a few special effects, music/audio and rotate the frames individual frames. What this app lacks, is control over the exposure. There are lesser apps with exposure compensation  control that allow you brighten or darken the image. The lack of this feature limits it's use in some instances, such as a time lapse capture of cloud or towards the morning/afternoon sun, where exposure compensation is very handy. This app would benefit greatly from at least this feature. Would be far better with more detailed exposure controls. Overall, it's a great app packed with good features.

It crashes on Android phones.  I've used it on three different ones, and it has crashed on all 3.  It runs well on iOS, however well - iOS sucks in general.   The LapseIt folks have apparently ceased creating LapseIt for iOS, since the only version available there is the older 2.4.  I suspect the reason it's crashing on my Android phones is because I changed it to write to SD card; perhaps it can't write at some point during a capture (even though there's plenty of space), and crashes randomly (sometimes after 30 minutes, an hour, two hours - it's random).  So I tried switching back to have it write to internal storage - but there's no option for this.   In the Settings entry for Output Folder - it only has the option ""USE SD-CARD"".    If I select ""I UNDERSTAND"" in order to browse folders to store it in - there's now way to revert back to the still-empty Internal Storage location.

Maybe it's because I've used it enough times to notice all the glitches, but this app just doesn't work very well. Perfect example: setting the time limit to ""timer"" is useful, except there's no clear way to SET the timer. I learned the hard way that it defaults to ten minutes. Also, there's a terrible flicker in the final renderings that can only be avoided by locking the automatic exposure. Another annoyance: the app locks your screen on, preventing it from going black, even after it's done recording.   The list goes on.   I paid $2 for it a few years ago, so I guess I got my money's worth, but it's time to find an alternative.  EDIT: No longer renders, with or without the ""awesome"" setting.

Only used 159mb, and had 40gb available, so wasn't lack of space/memory - if this must be continually monitored, that is problematic.  But it is a mobile app, and not an enterprise application, so it's forgivable.

I *wish* it had a zoom feature. It would probably work best if you have at least a mini-tripod. I *wish* there were better tutorials. Better tutorials=more stars. Gotta love an app developer who programs to allow the end user to define his/her own save path (e.g., sd card) which this app does allow. A text message will stop and/or delay this app in mid process. C'mon this is a phone and it gets messages... why allow this happen? This is not a fast process and a flaw like this can be a problem.

The only limiting factor is your imagination and battery capacity. TIPS; try to match total frames to length of capture. IE; you want to capture a one hour sequence and watch it over 30 seconds you might try 10 second intervals. Experimenting is slow but fun. You'll be surprised at the results.  Use a BT headset in order to get phone calls. Keep phone on charger if possible. It will use a lot of battery. Airplane mode is good if not expecting calls.,5,0,4.51,2014-07-10 03:54:58,,

Without ""compatibility mode"" turned on the right half of the frames in the video doesn't render properly (it comes out as basically gray stripes).  So, fine, it's not a big deal to turn on compatibility mode.  Except...  With compatibility mode turned on, if you're doing stop-motion capture, the onionskin image shows up at a right angle to your camera's current orientation.  You end up with two images at right angles to each other superimposed on your screen.  This makes the onionskinning, which should be quite helpful, worse than useless.  It is actually *more* confusing to have the right-angle onionskin than to have nothing at all.  That said, It's fun and easy to make videos with the app, and I've enjoyed using it so far.

I have to choose between using my phone as a time lapse camera only, or using it for everything else.  Enable the photo capturing in the background would be great for longer captures such as road trips, where the other functionality still comes in handy (GPS mapping, text messages, phone calls). - The ability to merge two capture projects together into one Because of point number one (phone calls stop the capture rather than pausing it), I would love to simply start a new capture with the same settings and then merge them together after the fact. - Delete single images from the capture Currently I can trim the start/end points but I can't delete single frames if I so choose.",4,1,3.4,2013-04-30 16:11:51,,

You have the choice to do multiple renders at different frame rates in the app itself after all the images have been captured, and the app stores all the frames, so if you want to render the stills into a movie on your computer, you can. Most impressive. Just be aware that you'll need a decent amount of internal storage if you want to store thousands of frames at 720p. Reckon on 650Kb for each 720p frame. Put another way, five minutes' worth of 720p frames at 30fps will cost you about  5.8Gb of storage, and that's before you get to do the render.
