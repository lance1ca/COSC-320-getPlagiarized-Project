The button for the sliding left menu was a tradeoff for a back button. To close the SMS, just swipe up from the bottom and use the back or home buttons on the navigation bar. You'll get used to it soon. It's the same as the matching notes app, too. It's not really more work than double tapping to exit.",2020-08-08 19:44:04

bringing what he sees as the next generation of user interface with style,
