But you should keep the ""STANDARD"" available and let the old users to choose if the want to upgrade or not.

The ""on-line"" help or the FAQ (instructions about how to set up the app are in the FAQ area - unbelieve) are far to be enough and I still cannot use the ""IMPROVEMENTS"" as I have no idea how to use or what for are the ""New options"".
