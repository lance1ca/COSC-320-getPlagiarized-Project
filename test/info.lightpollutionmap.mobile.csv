Extended menu doesn't work at all...must purchase per device... Live and learn :/,1,0,,2020-09-21 19:45:51,"I'm sorry for your bad experience. Have you read the app description? It is exactly the same as the free web version (minus ads, plus offline mode), so you can actually try it. For any improvements and suggestions I'm always available via email. You can install it anywhere according to Google (https://rb.gy/ddkoqn). I have no control over this.",2020-09-22 00:59:54

Also adding locations to favorites list (""My Locations"") just doesn't work. Nothing happens when you try to type the name, or hit the pin button, or anything. Also can't even see the entire map legend, the legend image is too long to fit on the the screen and it's not possible to scroll down to see the rest of it.",3,0,1.0.3,2020-09-15 15:02:01,"Thanks for your valuable feedback! I will try to fix the issues you mention (app storage location, legend scroll and favorites UI changes) in the upcoming releases.",2020-09-16 02:26:44
