So promptly bought it. I made my way from quick games through the campaign levels. I did enjoy playing it but don't think it translates well to a small touch screen without a real control buttons.  There is no specific on screen button to move, jump or back flip. Only touching the worm a certain way or sides of screen. For this reason it tends to misinterpret you in the most annoying moment. For example I found if there is water right below and I needed to back flip out of danger it almost always jumped into the water instead! As if it did it on purpose because the game thought it would be funny to kill you. It isn't easy to scroll either, requiring two fingers to drag around, and by the time you get that working the game can zoom out and/or walk your worm off a cliff into doom which you didn't see. Also you can't really move around the edges of the screen as it can't seem to detect you want to move out and the worm just jumps in the wrong direction. So I think the game could be made easier to work on a touch screen with on screen movement buttons and dragging screen to scroll.",4,0,1.4.0,2017-04-22 06:59:50,,

The AI will sometimes make perfect near-impossible shot, and on the next turn, they'll stick a dynamite on your head and stay right there, probably to witness your death. Sometimes, they shoot a mile away from anything and it makes you wonder what it was trying to even do. If you can deal with no plot and poor AI, there's also the control. They're okay, but when you close to the edge of the map, you may find yourself unable to move closer to it without jumping around. Sometimes there is sound issues with the game. No jumping sounds, no explosions, no whatever. Apparently it has been fixed but it still happens to not work sometimes. Weapon variety is good enough. Customisation to our teams are a cool add-on.

Thanks for the kind feedback. Unfortunately, the 'Worm Swap' utility that you're looking for isn't included in this version of the game. This means that you would need to play your worms on a 'next-in-line' basis.

If a worm is on the right end of the level and looks to the left. You did not totally zoom in and try to move more to the right and instead the worm jumps to the left because you seem to have tapped on the worm. Or your worm looks to the right and you have to move your aim out of the way before you can move right. Positioning of construction elements is hard as well.

The game only requires an internet connection for online multiplayer game modes and a momentary licence check once a month or so. 
The rest of the game is accessible without an internet connection.

But honestly it is more fun to go to a hotseat game and use a gamestyle youve made. Though I never played forts style on worms 2 original I feel as if the forts on this one should still have health like in under seige. Kind of like a stronghold and you could be on flat or hillish land. Possibly expand the map width and add some building locations(stars) and create the tower weapons again like trebuchet and the giant laser etc. I'd pay for that DLC.,5,0,1.4.0,2014-04-09 00:14:29,,

Poor GUI feedback makes it difficult to tell why some things won't shoot.  The difficulty curve is also really punishing. I love a challenge but by world 9 if you miss one shot you're dead. Opponents will ace you perfectly with shots involving wind from the other side of the map.

Worms has always been a fun game, but I'd much rather play on a different platform.  Edit: thanks for the reply Team 17; even when the sound did work, the clumsiness of the controls was the real reason I abandoned this release. After the nth time my worm jumped into the sea instead of just wriggling forward, I couldn't take the frustration any more.  I'm sure it works better on tablets, but on a phone-sized screen there just isn't enough room for comfortable controls.  So yeah, don't get me wrong, Worms is an all-time favorite gam of mine, but it did not work for me on an Android phone.",2,0,1.3.9,2014-01-07 05:35:05,"Good morning Oren,

The difficulty modes need to be adjusted to properly reflect what it's called. Easy is hard, hard is, well just silly, the computer is far far to accurate to simulate playing actual people... Hope there'll be an update to address this.

I still struggled with the controls despite knowing the basics of game play.  Need better discovery and tutorial of controls such as worm movement. After 10 minutes I still have not mastered this.

We don't have any current server issues - is there a pattern to the issues that you are experiencing? Is this occurring with a particular game style? 

We'd like to look into this for you, but we will need more information to do so. If you're not comfortable with emailing, change review description with details.

It works great on my Nexus 4 and Nexus 7.  You can play multiplayer either on the same device, on the same wifi network, or even over the internet. You can play with random players and join random games, or you can host a private game and someone else (that knows the game name) can join directly. As long as you're both connected to the internet via WIFI it doesn't matter where you are. I play with relatives at the other side of the country!  The disadvantages are, teams are limited to 4 worms so you can't have huge epic firefights. You can't use custom presets in multiplayer, so you're limited in what you can customise. I prefer having either no time limit or a 5 minute limit for turns for ninja roping fun, but this isn't an option.  Campaign isn't as interesting as some versions of worms, and there are a couple of graphical glitches on the Nexus where the edges are cut off. It also doesn't play sounds as frequently as the other versions. I miss ""...What was that?!"" when you mess up a shot and miss completely.  The replays seem to be random rather than on good shots.

Wi-Fi matches are not limited to the same network, you should be able to see players from around the world creating games.

We recommend creating your own multi-player match, and waiting a few moments for another player to join your game.

Controls are very confusing. Trying to touch different areas of the screen for movement/weapons controls is not very intuitive and needs work. I agree with James Corner's review and the need for control customization. Being a longtime Worms user, I can adapt to the new controls, but new users may find it very difficult to adjust to. 2. Needs asynchronous play, a feature present in the iPhone version. Playing an entire game can be time consuming; I would like to be able to play individual turns with my friends when I have a spare minute or two. 3. No Facebook integration. VERY IMPORTANT! I have friends who love Worms but no way to play with them without a private game/password, which is unbelievably cumbersome. Allow me to invite Facebook friends to play, or see who has it installed on their phone. 4. Cross compatibility with iOS version, if possible.  Overall, I give you a solid ""Needs Improvement.""

They are non intuitive and awkward to use when you do figure them out.  Aiming precisely is difficult as you have to put your finger over the aiming target to move it, so you can't see exactly where it is. Would like to be able to toggle between move and aim modes. The weapons that allow you to aim freely (like air strike) also didn't seem to work very well.   Had to search through the how to play section in the settings (which itself wasn't easy to find being only accessible on the initial splash screen) to figure out how to look around the levels.
