It resembles temple run, which I like and has a story we love with Boggo, BUT you have split seconds to make the right moves. Not just one move, but several. This is more frustrating than fun. I die very quickly in the game, which is discouraging. I suggest any of the following revisions: making the controls more user friendly, allow more time to make decisions, not have multiple defensive mechanisms, and allow Boggo to navigate by tilting the phone, similar to temple run.",2,18,1.01,2020-12-25 10:55:54,,

There are a few things to point out that need major improvements-The sensitivity for the ball is ridiculous. Its incredibly hard to aim properly and I often find myself missing the target more than I would like to admit. Next up is the levels; I barely reached level two and it progressed so much when I'm still trying to get a hang of the controls. Need improvements!,3,6,1.01,2020-12-25 10:01:18,,

Sorry, I really wanted to like this game cause the comics are great but having the bath bomb and jump be almost the same controls is terrible idea and throwing the bath bombs just doesn't work. Plus moving left or right is annoying having to swipe twice to move all the way over. Game idea and concept is great, controls are terrible",3,0,,2020-12-24 18:39:03,,
