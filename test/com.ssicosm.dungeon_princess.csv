The spritework and animations are high quality. The game itself is slow and boring. The story and tutorial text boxes are poorly designed. (They have a set time that you can speed up, but you can't tap a single box away, only skip the cutscene. Text will always automatically disappear, meaning whether you think it lasts too long, or not long enough, the only thing you can DO as a player is make them auto-play faster, or skip them ALL. You should be able to dismiss one text at a time.) The menu to select your attacks is inconvenient. It takes too much time to kill even basic enemies, because you have to generate mana to do basic attacks. The game would be more fun if you could rapidly tap the screen to build up mana faster. I only played for a few minutes, honestly, because I thought it was sluggish and dull. It gets 2 stars for the artwork but otherwise it's 1 star.",2,15,,2018-11-04 20:58:23,,

This game definitely deserves a spot on the playstore. However, the game is still new and it really does need improving. I felt like the game would get boring quickly if there was no side-story to it at all, so it was a good call to make one (I'm eagerly waiting on chapter 2 lol). It isn't the best written story for a game, but I don't think that was really the point, it's a great addition. Many players have said this already but I will say it again. Smooth UI is necessary. Music wise, it's rather half decent. And with that I mean half of the soundtracks are actually good, but the other half...gonna have to take the music in area B and C as an example, it really doesn't built up any ""battle"" tension. Other things I gotta mention is the somewhat lag I get when I open the inventory chests and it's full of ""new"" items. Lastly there's just loads of bugs. I'm aware that the game is a work in progress and I'm writing this review for the simple opinion that you guys are on good tracks and i'd love to see more.",4,12,192,2018-09-18 13:47:36,Thanks for your support and good review.
