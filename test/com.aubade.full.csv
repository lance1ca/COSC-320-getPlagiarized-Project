With Aubade, this is handled by letting you specify a time in milliseconds.  This time is 'subtracted' from the new track, shifting it left, to synch it with the existing tracks. However, the key thing for me was to experiment with this time.  It will calculate a time for you based on a test on your phone - but this was not accurate enough for me.
