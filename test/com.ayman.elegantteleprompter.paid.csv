I just have one request for improvement: When 'Tap to Play/Pause' setting is activated, tapping brings up the GUI elements at the top and bottom of the screen, which is distracting when you're live. I wish there were an option where a single tap just pauses the text without showing any GUI elements, and another tap gets it rolling again. A double tap or a long tap can be used if the user wishes to show the GUI elements.
