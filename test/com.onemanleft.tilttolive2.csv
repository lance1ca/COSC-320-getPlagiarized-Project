The first release did crash but I contacted the devs and they had it working in just a few hours. There may be some performance issues but it is a pretty graphically advanced game. It didn't lag too bad on my phone but may on lower end devices. Still very fun and a nice nostalgia trip. Very well made artistically and mechanically.,5,1,1.2.3,2014-02-24 16:57:22,,

Now that I can play TTL2, I absolutely love it! It has intense, fun, and quick gameplay, all aspects that make for a perfect mobile game. I would enjoy a gauntlet mode similar to TTL1, and it would be nice if the game went full screen, but I'm just being picky. I highly recommend this game.",4,0,1.2.3,2014-02-24 11:33:28,,

It's absurdly fun and self-aware funny, you'll find jokes in every corner. The power-ups make you feel godly— to a point: not everything will save your butt. So that's where skillful navigation of your arrow comes into play, especially in bosses. Music is fun as ever, very groovy stuff. And a lot of care and attention clearly went into visuals, effects and backgrounds for the game— from the main menu to the game over screen.  Very well worth it on high-end devices. Finally, my only request right now is for Immersive Mode on Kit Kat.  Thanks for making the jump to Android, OML!",5,2,1.2.2,2014-02-24 10:55:46,,
