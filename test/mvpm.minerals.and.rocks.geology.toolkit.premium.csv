The swipe menu works very fine, but you need to swipe proximal to the left edge. I found in a previous version that menu-swipe interfere with other swipe functions (from thin sections for example). Please, can you reconsider your review/stars. I will consider your comment as an issue for further investigations.
Thanks.",2016-12-19 22:25:11
