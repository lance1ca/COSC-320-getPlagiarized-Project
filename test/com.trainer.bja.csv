He can play the hands without betting. So he's able to play the hands so much faster and I don't know why I don't have that feature. He has a apple phone and mines an android, would that be the difference?",3,4,1.3,2021-02-08 16:42:45,There are a few minor features that haven't made it from our iOS app to our Android app quite yet.

If the user could somehow choose specific deviations to focus on, that would be helpful in my opinion. Perhaps a new drill mode (Deviations only) could be added which only deals hands that deviate from basic strategy. If the user could also select which deviations are dealt in that drill, that would be terrific. For example, only H17 deviations 1-5, 1-10 etc. Other than that, the app is quick and efficient :)",5,3,1.3,2021-01-14 11:24:54,,

I really hope you add more to this app or you're going to have some very mad customers. There is nothing related to cards counting. After using the application for about a month, I'm changing my review. The app does have a lot of the features I initially thought were missing because it wasn't clear that the options existed. After using it for a while I did find what I was looking for in a sub-menu. So, to be clear, you can work on card counting and deviations in this app, which is what sets it apart from the others.
