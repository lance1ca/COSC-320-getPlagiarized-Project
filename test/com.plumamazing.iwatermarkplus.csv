The pictures come up really small in the app and you cant zoom in so ots really hars to get a precise watermark placement which is a major issue for me. Then to top that off, when you've spent ages placing the watermark in a particular location, you save it downa nd the watermark is moved in the saved file! So annoying 😡 really not happy with this app.",1,1,4.0,2018-09-10 23:25:27,"please get the beta (test version) for the paid version for android 11 here. contact us direct with details, feedback, and screenshots and we act on it right away. thanks
