Used free app for years LOVED! Month-ish ago timer stopped going off if I was looking at another app and didn't have this app up on my screen or if my screen was asleep. I'd notice that it had gone past the time the timer should have alarmed and so I'd bring up the app and as soon as I would the alarm would start ringing. I decided to buy the app to see if that would help. It hasn't. üôÅ Is there a setting I'm missing? It is no good to me the way is.

Many tweaks allowed. Very reliable. However there is one thing that is missing for my needs/wants/looks: Could you please implement a one level subgroup that could be ran with one touch? Let me try explain what I mean by simple example: Let's say I have a group of timers called ""Sleeping"". There I would like to have 3 timers. Two timers are simple: one is ""8 Hours Sleep"" and another one is ""26 Minutes Power Nap"". However third timer in this group would be complex""Get to Work on Time"" and would consist of three linked timers: ""Wake up in 8 hours"" + ""Make sure that you're awake in 10 minutes"" + ""Make sure that you exit house within 20 minutes"". So when I open group ""Sleeping"" I would like to see only 3 timers to run (2 simple and 1 chained (group)) and not 5 timers. It would be nice if I could run such subgroup just as easy as I can run simple timers. So far as a workaround, to keep it nice, I have created ""Sleeping"" group and a group called ""Extras"" and linked my 3rd alarm to other alarms in ""Extras"". While it keeps group ""Sleeping"" clean and tidy, group ""Extras"" is a mess, as there are also extra linked timers for cooking and many other complex alarms from other groups.

this app. The developer is obviously very knowledgeable. This is one of the 
most customizable apps I'd ever used, and I am very fond of playing around 
with Android and customizing them in such a way that I would be able to 
meet my needs and use Android's potential as fully as possible. While I do 
admit this app isn't the prettiest and would do great in popularity by 
improving in that regard, it's on another level in terms of function. Kudos
