Also, please add the ability to paste the password, and to remember it, for those of us with 20+ chars secure passwords. - Then, getting kicked from games and being silently replaced with IAs. We've lost 3 games already due to this. Intolerable!. - Having to buy cards 3/4 times each turn. Either you program correctly everybody buying their cards, or you do it by order - The log is just horrible. A card takes 3 plants from a player. From whom?. You'll never now until you remembered what everybody had and you compare. - Who decided to change the icons, and what's worse, not to change them everywhere?. Way to make it harder for those that have played the board game. - When you end an async match, only the person that finished it and is connected gets to see the end. After that, NOBODY can see how that went. We have to remember to take a screenshot at the end so we can share it between us. IN-CREDIBLE. - Lost opportunities to avoid waits between turns. If I can't do anything because I have no money and no cards, wait for me. If I know that I'm doing an action and passing, offer me a ""skip action and pass next turn"". - Interface is horrible to make friends and create matches. Full of glitches too, like a select box showing under the button of a different option. I could go on and on, but I'll stop there. It's a pity that they didn't put more care into this. They really have no excuse here, we'll talking about the (currently) #3 best game ever in BGG, and there is not exactly a lack of funds in Asmodee.

It will tell you the game as ended but you'll never know who won or what the details where unless someone else tells you. 3) If the game is not in the foreground and your screen on then you get disconnected and told about it 2-3 times.

An autosave after each turn would be an obvious temporary fix, but these sort of game-breaking bugs need to be resolved urgently. Update: Seems to be more stable on my phone than my tablet, but still crashes occasionally. Also the time to load games is ridiculous! But the maid problem is that the game clearly hasn't been playtested by people that understand the board game. When reaching certain points on the terraforming tracks, you get a bonus. These do not trigger. Certain cards, such as Power Infrastructure are broken in this build, but were fixed on the computer version some time ago. Things like this would have been obvious on the very first play by anybody familiar with the source material and totally alter the way the game is supposed to work. Also the AI is dire. Even on Hard level, they make basic mistakes and always follow the same strategy, making for boring games. Simple examples include: they always spam aquifers and other standard projects, meaning that the game is rushed (less interesting for players who enjoy the engine-building aspect) but that the AIs rarely win. In almost all cases cards provide a cheaper way of increasing the global parameters and often provide an additional points bonus or other benefit. Standard Projects should be a last resort given how expensive they are. It's also clear that they have little randomness in their choices, as they always start building on the left hand side of the map, despite other valid choices being available. They don't consider the placement of greenarys so as not to provide good placements for opponent cities. Even really basic things such as selling any remaining cards on the final turn of the game (as money is a tiebreak) are not done. It's such a shame, because this is such a good game, and the fundamental implementation is quite good. But basic things not working, and an uninteresting AI challenge really drag it down. Looking forward to the patches.",3,13,1.1368,2020-02-21 05:19:57,"Hello,

THE GOOD: It's Terraforming Mars on mobile and it works. Game is fun. THE BAD: You can't multitask with this game. If you switch to another app then switch back then the game restarts so it takes a minute to get back to what you were doing. Why? Never seen another mobile game like this. UI is slow and clunky. IDK if it's because of the 3D graphics but the game always feels a little laggy, especially when interacting with the board. No undo command. This is just ridiculous considering the game is designed so that opponents don't see your moves until you are done. There is no reason to not have an undo command except for dev laziness, and the clunky interface means that misclicking the board is easy to do when placing tiles. Friends list implementation is terrible (friends need to be online for you to add them). Async play doesn't work when drafting (everyone needs to be on at the same time during drafting). No expansion content. This game is simply not as good without Prelude and the extra boards. Implementing these expansions would make the game much better. UI for seeing cards is weak. Can only look at 4 cards at a time. Very hard to follow what your opponents are doing without constantly going to them and browsing through their played cards. The game needs to a find a way to show more info without having to open menus. Through The Ages is an example of a game perfectly implemented on mobile with a massive amount of polish. The devs should take notes from them. Terraforming Mars feels like it was thrown together quickly as a money grab. I'm glad the game at least works though. It's fun to play with a few friends or randoms if you're all online at the same time.",3,6,1.1230,2020-01-03 12:36:41,"Hello Erik,

Second game crashed too. When I restarted, both were available under ""Resume"", but once I'm in one of them, I can't figure out how to leave it and switch to the other without forfeiting. Edit:: fewer more bugs/comments: when playing against AI, if I close the game because I have to use my phone to do something else, and reopen the app, there is no option to resume the game. In multiplayer, the timer starts before you are able to make a move (which takes too long because of the lengthy animations), so I've already watched the game slip away as the clock ticked down before I was able to click on Pass. The game has also frozen before when I passed in the last generation, when both players have passed already, and I couldn't do anything to get it going. Lastly, please, PLEASE, get rid of the constant confirmations in the multiplayer that a player finished their turn. Make it into a notification/vibration/noise, or a flashing screen, whatever, but keep the game going. If I want to see what happened, I'll check the log.",2,6,1.1205,2019-12-16 15:06:43,"Hello,
