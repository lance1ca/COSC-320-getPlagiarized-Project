Normally a sandbox mode in games is more of making your own levels/puzzles but the sandbox here gives some levels and 40 of every item in the game and its different but I like it.

Save up your hint points since some of the later levels are quite difficult.  My feedback for the developers 1) The CPU usage could be lower.  Could you limit the frame rate? 2) Players should be given a reward for not using all of the modules. 3) The fastest animation speed could be faster. 4) Rather than requiring 4 balls to complete the level you could consider the level to be completed after the first ball goes in as soon as an iteration prior to the first ball is repeated. You could do this by keeping a HashSet of the state each iteration.  5) Add at least one level with unlimited modules so people can play with them.  This could evolve into a level editor.  6) Let people see your solution after they solve a level so they can compare.",5,3,2.0,2015-10-18 09:22:47,,
