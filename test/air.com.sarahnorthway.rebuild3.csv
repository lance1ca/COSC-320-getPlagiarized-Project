run through the campaign or do a quick play. There's so much to this game. 
It's mobile gaming nearly perfected. I say nearly because there's still 
room for improvement. What about finding a map? Sometimes I wish I didn't 
have to scout the whole map. And I always turn the visitors away because 
they always steal fuel or medicine. There's 200,000 words in the game, but 
Rebuild 4 should have a dedicated writer. The events are pretty 
predictable. The buildings also have unlimited possibilities. It's cool 
there's the water tower, the ware house, the pig farm etc, but I feel like 
so much more could be done with the sub way or Forest. There's also the two 
issues I run into. If you're not near a lab or a huge farm, you're 
basically screwed. The major issue is that the challenging difficutly is 
near impossible whereas the normal mode is fairly easy. I wish there was an 
inbetween. I can't seem to gain a foothold on challenging. All in all it's 
still a five star game. I can't wait for the sequel to see what Sarah comes 
up with.",5,2,1.6.17,2018-08-05 14:18:06,,

the series and I loved first installment back on Kongregate. Your game 
starts with just a bunch of survivors that can do one of 6 tasks each: 
scavenging which you rely on early on, building which helps your settlement 
to grow, engineering to research 'technologies', defense to kick ass and 
chew bubblegum and of course leadership, needed for interactions with other 
factions or survivors. Game has a classic storyline of moving from place to 
place rebuilding society as we knew it but each map is different and has 
its share of challenges. Game plays in real-time with active pause which 
gives you time to manage survivors and tasks. Your settlement has various 
problems to overcome from internal conflicts to random raids and 
encounters. Game offers very pleasant experience as well as gives you that

I'm very much addicted. More can be added to this game to make it even better. Consider adding multi player, both on, and offline. Offline multi player game would be purely turn based, i think thats self explanitory. Online could be given the option of turn based. But how fun would it be to have ranked matches between 2 - 12 real Player factions playing in a non-pausable day to night timer based game. Everyone would be working the map/alliances at the same time. Give quick commands to talk to players via keyboard, but only if you send a leader to converse at a picticuler player faction. Thus only talking to factions near by or that you have personally discovered. Events can still happen the same way, just does not pause. Ranked games would be set on challenging difficulty, i still struggle with hard early game. We want people killing each other, so dont make the zombies to hard lol. Im sure it's been considered, and perhaps even being worked on. One thing is for sertain... I'm on the rebuild train. Keep up the good work, love the game, love the potential can't wait for the next one. All we want is more events, more resources, more character classes, more, more more, ect lol.
