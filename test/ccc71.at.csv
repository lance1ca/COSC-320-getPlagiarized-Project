If I could give this app TEN stars I would.  If it was TWENTY bucks I'd pay it.  It is simply the best app I've ever used for Android.  I use it on every device I own.  What prompted me to edit the review is this - Last night I flashed a new ROM (Android 4.2) on my tablet.  It was a new kernel as well.  I didn't like it and tried to go back to my old ROM.  Not happening... I thought I'd bricked my tablet.   After a complete factory reset I finally got the OS running... of course there were no apps.  Since I am always trying the ""latest"" and ""greatest"" I've gotten used to re-downloading and reinstalling everything.  But as I got started I remembered AT.  I downloaded it, installed it, hit ""One Click"" restore and in six minutes EVERY app I had before was restored and working perfectly.  I know there are a lot of backup restore apps..  But AT takes care of everything for me.  I can tweak anything from CPU speed to individual lines in the build and sysctl files.. or there are dozens of tweaks and presets.

Money well invested... Minimal battery impact unlike other similar applications.  I think I literally uninstalled 5 or 6 other applications after installing this one.  Too bad I can't get my money back for some of them!  (And thanks for the prior purchase credit for 3C apps!)  Thanks 3C! ~Josh,5,0,,2012-10-07 16:13:30,,

At about the same time I was looking for a nice battery monitor with a customizable widget and found Battery Monitor widget. Both customizable to the hilt - love that since I'm a nerd.  Yesterday, I stumbled across Android Tuner and found all my wishes rolled into one app. System tweaking and monitoring, battery monitoring, automated app backup: just what I wanted ;-)",5,1,Beta 0.1.8,2012-10-06 11:42:08,,
