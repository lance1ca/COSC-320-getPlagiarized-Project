for NES era RPGs, but this has not been updated for this release. 2) The

Let's break this review down further to help interested people make the decision.  -This is a single character, Roleplaying Game. So, there's no party dynamic. -While it is a Single Character JRPG, you have several ways to approach encounters whether you favor a magic approach or a sword and board style. -Linear equipment progression, usually you never have to wonder which item would suit you better. -Accessories are a bit confusing, I had the Warriors Ring equipped and I wasn't entirely sure what it did nor what the Waistband did. -The inventory system leaves MUCH to be desired, quest items that you must have will end up taking over half of your inventory. You can however deposit items into a bank. -The Save feature also leaves MUCH to be desired. If you die away from your Kings Castle then you will be transported back after losing half of your carried gold (which also can be deposited into a bank for protection). You can only make a 'legitimate' save inside the Kings Castle whilst talking to the King. Otherwise it is known as a 'Quick Save'. -Story is basic but I found it pleasant. I found everything was adequately hinted at by NPCs in various towns WITH THE EXCEPTION of the rainbow. Just go ahead and look that up when you get to it, youll know what I mean when you get there. I'm not going to spoil anything. -Combat Encounters are challenging but not too difficult. If you're stuck at an area or boss (Green Dragon anyone?) Then just grind a little and maybe upgrade your gear like all JRPGs. -This last bit is just a personal touch, I thoroughly enjoyed that Dragon Warrio- er Quest did not shy away from introducing a love interest. In the age of Zelda and Final Fantasy they were much more forthcoming. Just thought it was neat.  Overall, it's cheap and thoroughly enjoyable.

With the above method, tap the menu, and place the directional button on the left or right side, both buttons should function.

It's a good game and worth playing.  The port could have been handled a lot better though.  The pixel graphics were inconsistently scaled, and weren't even consistently square. That's just sloppy and inexcusable.  The controls were fairly clunky. They were considerate enough to put in several different button layouts, including ones for left-handed people and people with small hands, but they put a button that cycled through the layouts in the main interface. It would trigger accidentally during regular play, and it should have been in the settings menu instead.  Now, old RPGs as cellphone games usually have great replay value - I had FF1 on an old (nonsmart) phone, and milked challenge runs for years. DQ doesn't have as many opportunities for this (there is no DQ analogue for a single thief party), but the port is missing some basic features that would have helped. It doesn't even have a timer for speed runs, and it inexplicably lacks the ""Name yourself ENIX and the game gets harder"" feature from the original game.

The graphics resize algorithm is quite ugly though.  It looks like a simple pixel resize to a non-integer multiplier so it's terribly ugly.  Even a GPU-accelerated bilinear would be better, though I think a 2xSaI or similar for those with powerful enough systems would be ideal (let the user choose.)  I will say that the single finger controls I so hated in the 3D DQ8 actually work well here in the 2D original DQ.  It's a little fidgety on my phone, so I do still wish they had a full blown d-pad instead of a tiny d-pad and a slide control, but one gets used to it.
