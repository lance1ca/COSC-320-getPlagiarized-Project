Back then, I had suggestions for improvements since I was coming from a discontinued panorama stitching app. The developer was very responsive and I'm very happy some ideas got implemented. I had also suggested monetizing the app because it's a very good one for mobile stitching. It is a good, no-frills app to get an idea of what a panorama would turn out like.
