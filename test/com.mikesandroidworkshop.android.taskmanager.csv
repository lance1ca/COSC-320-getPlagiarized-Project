Little did I know that this functionality was always there.  I've since recently upgraded to the Pro version because $3 and change is worth having the import function as often as I have to format my devices and re-install due to crapware loading junk.  ToDo List Task Manager still proves to be the best app of its kind.  People may make remarks about its appearance, but in all honesty, what's more important?  Looking pretty, or getting the job done.  At the end of the day, I know what I want.  I'm running this on an HTC EVO 4G LTE and use the 4x1 Widget on my home screen just underneath the sense clock.  No title, transparent, only showing task names and due dates.  Looks good enough to me!

This, however, does exactly as it says on the tin: a powerful TODO manager with a good set of features and widgets. It communicates with Executive Assistant, allows for filtering, reminders, priorities, notes, progress, and (limited) workflow handling.  The user interface is clean, with font size handling allowing one to circumvent the usual ""too big by far"" habit of most Android applications. Date formats can be set, proving that the author has thought i8n through, as can the available information shown.  As for support, the author is friendly, with a good turnaround time on questions asked. Would be well worth the money at thrice the price.
