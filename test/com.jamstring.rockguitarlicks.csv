I paid for the app 2 months ago and it will not download on my phone. It says waiting to download but never does. Don't waste your money EDIT: today is 10/28/20. App just downloaded to my phone. These sound like good licks for those just starting to play lead guitar. Will update again when I've had a chance to go over them more.,1,12,15.95759381,2020-10-28 16:08:14,,

Have tried all guitar genre apps from the Jam String catalogue, and this is definitely my favourite. Bryan Bernas commented that taking the same 24 licks and just changing keys does not make 96 licks(?). Not sure what he is on about, because there are definitely 96 individual licks. Looking forward to getting proficient with ALL 96 individual licks üëç",5,5,15.95759381,2020-10-05 11:10:25,,
