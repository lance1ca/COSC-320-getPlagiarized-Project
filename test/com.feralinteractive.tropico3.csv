I do not think the controls are clunky and am actually very surprised at how well Feral pulled this off. The graphics are nice, and everything you expect from Tropico is there. Tropico is my favorite series and I have played them all. This is a solid port in my opinion, and like any game, once you get use to the controls, it does not feel clunky at all. Good job Feral. This game deserves to be at the top of list.",5,38,1.3RC6-android,2019-09-06 03:45:29,,

However this port does look beautiful, it needs work. Controls are clunky. Just laying a road is a challenge. I hope things can be tightened up in an update. There is just too much going on the screen at once, too many buttons. Menus need to be better organized etc. Other than that the game is great. Has potential to be 5 star but requires just a little more work. After messing with the sensitivity settings, the app is more responsive",4,72,1.3RC6-android,2019-09-05 18:30:53,,

If you are a tropico fan this is a must have. I've been playing since tropico first came out and this is a perfect addition. The graphics are still gorgeous. Placing buildings is easy especially with the new architect mode. Being able to see distances between important buildings makes it easy to plan the layout of your island. Having more control over El Presidente is fantastic. Nothing has felt clunky or frustrating. Mobile game of the year,5,22,1.3RC6-android,2019-09-05 16:11:57,,
