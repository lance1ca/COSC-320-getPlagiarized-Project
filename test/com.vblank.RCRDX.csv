Only problem I've had was getting my Xbox controller to work correctly. The game acts like I'm continually pressing up on the right stick. At first I thought it was a problem with the joypad having drift and needing an adjustable dead zone to fix. After some experimenting I found that even with the joypad unplugged after the problem started it would still continue as if I was pressed up on the stick still. I've tested for pad drift too with none found.,3,11,1.0.7,2020-10-28 15:03:52,,
