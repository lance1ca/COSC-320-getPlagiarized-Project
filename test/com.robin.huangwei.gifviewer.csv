I will play slideshows of static images (jpg, png), animated (gif), and video (MP4), which is awesome!  However, getting to the slideshow is somewhat cumbersome, as is choosing the folders you want. Currently, you can only add individual files to favorites. I would much rather be able to add entire folders to favorites. That way I can say play favorites and I'm done. Instead I have to name my folders in such a way that they stay at the top of the gallery list so I can select them each time to run the slideshow. Also, after selecting the folders, and hitting the play button, the slideshow doesn't actually start, it simply displays the first image in the first folder. You have to tap the image and then tap the slideshow icon, then it will start. I think there could be a better way. Also, some of the options overlap. For example: there is a repeat option. If you set that to the max of 10 , it will play both animated gifs and videos 10 times then go to the next one. Problem is, videos tend to be much longer than gifs, need separate option for gifs and video. That option also multiplies the static image duration.",4,7,3.8.3,2018-11-29 14:07:22,"Thanks for your comment, I will consider to add those additional options in future.",2018-12-03 23:37:16
