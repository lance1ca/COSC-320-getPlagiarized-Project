The match isn't able to end. Complete waste of time. There needs to be a way to force the game to end at this point. I'd even take a stalemate option.,1,10,29.17,2021-01-08 22:15:35,,

However I can't give it a full five stars because of two issues that combine to make online play almost impossible. One, tabbing out of the app to switch to any other screen (text messaging client for instance) will disconnect the player from the game with no way I'm aware of to reconnect. Added to this is the worse of the two issues, which is the keyboard connection to the game is somehow messed up. It won't allow the use of backspace or enter keys. This breaks in game chat (which exacerbates the other issue, negating the ability to communicate with others while playing). This also breaks private server selection (since the name can't be changed, which is required for selecting the server). In a perfect world, the game wouldn't disconnect every time i switch to my text messaging client. It would also allow reconnection to the same game if I were disconnected. Since the games can take hours, it would also allow saving an online game in progress so it could be reconnected. I'd settle for fixing the keyboard, which would make the game painful and kludgey but at least playable online. My brother's iPhone has no issue with the keyboard. It's a very fun game, just a problematic implementation. Fix the bugs and I'll upgrade my review.

Worst of all it relies on google play games and when it can't reach the internet it falls into a connection loop and cannot be played at all. Updates seem to make things worse, with the most recent one replacing some of the stock character graphics with broken black and white sprites. Good game. Very poor execution.

My favorite feature is the Skip to Next Human Player button, so you're not waiting 5minutes between your turn. It takes about 5 seconds to skip, leaving more time to actively enjoy playtime (something I wish the Horus Heresy version did). Also, being able to change options of the endgame is really neat if you're looking for a lengthy or quick game. Overall, a very satisfying, premium game worth every penny.

This is nothing like the board game experience. You can expect to start a game and be chased around the board by someone who can easily beat you from the start. You can also expect the rolls to always be bias in favor of the encounters or opponents. Your only high rolls will be against an opponent that can beat you in spite of your 6, or when that high roll has an unfavorable outcome. Read the reviews and see for yourself, it is entirely rugged and your average roll will be a 2. I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to make the dice loaded, but it does a disservice to what is a great board gaming experience. If they remove the obvious bias I will rate 4 stars gladly... I just cannot recommend anyone spend money on an unpleasant experience such as this. Dozens of games have shown me it is not merely chance, it is an algorithm designed to constantly put you at a disadvantage. Why would the developers do this? Perhaps it has to do with spending money to get runes or more able characters, but regardless, if you choose to find out for yourself how broken this game is - please come and tell others of your experience so they can save their money. We owe each other to not let more people get pulled into this trickery. To the developers, don't bother denying the bias dice, and don't you dare tell me you appreciate my feedback if you aren't going to reverse the nasty dice handicap. Ciao!  I have tracked the numbers in a few games i can stomach and first few rounds. You can count on always getting the same number if you rerol a dice for a bad effect on an event. Get the bad outcome and reroll to the same number.  My count was a repeat roll 23 out of 25 times. The devs are lying if they say there isn't a roll bias, that or their game has a glare flaw in the code..  uninstalled and thoroughly upset I can't get a refund.",2,7,14.2,2018-03-26 00:10:57,,

Not just ""not good"" but actively doing things to hurt itself. Often when an AI gets a wish (enchanter, etc) it chooses ""teleport"" and then teleport the a safe where it pays to gain a life, when it could have just chosen to get one for free from the wish (which, of course it shouldn't actually do either, since strength or craft are correct 90 or more percent of the time). The AI overvalues life. It attacks other players and takes lives, even though that almost never gains anything (since death isn't permanent, and you can't usually kill others fast enough any way). it's OK if the AI doesn't make good longterm decisions, but it shouldn't make such obvious, stupid errors that literally no human could ever make.",3,0,12.5,2018-01-30 20:33:22,,

Overall,Talisman is a funny and challenging game, at a much  more affordable price than the original boardgame, and with the possibility of playing against characters controlled by the AI, which can be helpful. Despite heavily depending on dice throws and random cards, your decisions and strategy have a lot of weight on the final outcome. Of course, there is a good amount of ""chance"" or ""luck"" (whatever you prefer to call it), but that is (as in real life) what makes things interesting, isn't it? ;)  However, there are some issues that need improvement, like the UI, which can be annoying or not very user friendly at some points, or the AI, which after a few games becomes less and less of a challenge. Online gameplaying is also quite limited, specially because of the several hours that can require a game with 5 or 6 players. Fortunately you have the local multiplayer (with pass-and-play possibility) that I think probably is a better option (if you can convince enough friends of course).   Despite these and some other flaws, I believe the game is worth investing a couple of bucks :)",4,1,10.5,2017-07-02 01:37:31,,

The dice rolls are a consistent problem with both the app and the game on Steam. There is also a way overpowered card in the Firelands expansion (Devout Blacksmith) that allows cards to be taken from the discard pile over and over again (should be only once per discarded card, then the previously card is removed from play). Sometimes the cards/skills don't work as they're supposed to, or aren't entirely clear (such as with the Ninja's Secret Strike ability not deducting the actual Craft value, but only the -starting- Craft value). Overall, I enjoy the game, but I'd like to see the bugs fixed, along with some of the way overpowered things toned down.",3,10,10.3,2017-03-06 10:30:35,,

Some people complain about the die rolls but I think that's just subjective- sometimes the randomizer hits a run of good or bad rolls. Fantastic fun!  However there is one major problem which others have mentioned as well- gameplay speed sometimes slows to a crawl.  Basic functions suddenly take many seconds to complete.  Cards being displayed when drawn from the deck take 4 seconds each,  rolling the die takes 7-8 seconds, the camera moving across the map etc.  The game becomes unplayable and when that occurs,  only quitting completely and re-launching the game restores normal speed.  Easy to fix for a solo game but unfortunately there's no way to resume online games, so that's a killer problem.  Some people have mentioned that this occurs when switching to different tasks and coming back to the game- for me it occurs whenever the screen blanks (either due to display timeout or accidentally hitting the button) and I turn it back on by hitting either the power or home buttons.

There's no reason for us to have weighted dice in a game like this, sometimes low dice rolls are beneficial (Mines, for example). It's a shame you feel this way, but please trust us that the dice rolls are not rigged.

This one is an improvement on every level. The UI is a work of art, both visually and functionally. It's beautifully rendered and animated, as well as easy to use and comfortable on the fingers. It offers additional card/characters sets as IAP, all of which i have purchased (and had no problems using, as some have reported), but the base game already has tons of replay value in it. This is _easily_ my most-played Android game, in terms of number of hours spent in front of it. Nomad support is responsive and they continue to port in expansions and fix bugs. My enjoyment of this game eventually prompted me to buy a physical set, which i also enjoy immensely. Many claim the RNG is weighted in favour of the AI players, but that is provably wrong (via simple experiments involving exiting and replaying a turn using different options). It's an annoying RNG, yes, but it's _provably_ not weighted towards the AI. (That said, i suspect that the AI ""knows"" what the next roll will be.)",5,5,6.51,2015-09-24 10:43:50,,
