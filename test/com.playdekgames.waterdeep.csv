only criticism concerns the multiplayer: 1) We gotta get some push 
notifications. I really don't like that I'm spammed with e-mail telling me 
it's my turn. 2) We need some better match making, or at least some 
policing of quick matches. Nearly every time I've joined a quick match, the 
match goes to ""Waiting for Host"" and the host doesn't start the game until 
the middle of the night. This is either because the host is in a different 
region or the host is filling a bunch of games and forcing a win by having 
everyone forefeit because the clock runs out. 3) We should get the DLC in 
this version if we own it on PC. If you're going to allow us to carry over 
our PC matches on our phone, we shouldn't be forced to buy the DLC again 
just so we aren't locked out of our matches. I'm being forced to forefeit

First, the ""best"" AI is weak... REALLY weak. They prioritize 25- and 40-point quests without the time or means to get the resources. They don't prioritize strong Plot Quests at any stage of the game, ignoring or abandoning them for minor gains. They mostly hit each other with Intrigue Cards (especially Mandatory Quests) instead of the player, and over-prioritize playing them. And the biggest flaw: they don't prioritize their hidden Lord bonus AT ALL.  There are a few graphic bugs, but the biggest is that the wrong Lord shows in the post-game for Undermountain lords. The right lord shows during final scoring, but it is then wrong in the last screen.  Finally, some rules errors are present. An example: putting a building into play with Lure Artisans of Mirabar should not reward bonus VPs from Infiltrate Builder's Hall (it's not buying a building).  All in all, it's very solid, but far from perfect. I love the game, however, and it's nice and convenient, so it gets 4 stars.",4,1,2.0.4,2018-03-12 15:58:05,,
