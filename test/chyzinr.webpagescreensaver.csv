My only wish would be a way to go back after clicking a link without exiting the screensaver; maybe show a simple browser UI only if navigated away from the initial URL?",5,0,1.2,2021-01-03 10:09:17,Thank you for the review. I'll consider that enhancement for a future release,2021-01-03 11:51:59

Its possible that the Screensaver settings are incompatible (this is the case for firestick). Contact me if it doesn't work for you and you'd like a refund,2021-01-03 04:15:49

This is exactly what I have been looking for. Wanted a way to display my calendar as my TVs screensaver. The fact that it uses Dakboard is even better. Have only had it installed for a day, but it's been working perfect on my two Sony Bravia's. A suggestion would be to link to our Dakboard account so we can easily select the screen we want to display. The URLs can get pretty long, and using the remote is tedious, especially having to do it on multiple devices. Or if that's not possible, just be able to store multiple URLs.",5,1,1.2,2020-12-10 08:31:38,"Glad to hear it's working for you. 
Linking it to the dakboard account would definitely make the setup easier. Others use this app for different dashboard services as well though. If there's enough requests for dakboard specifically then I'll add it",2020-12-10 10:07:22

The only downside being that I had to manually override the ambient mode of the Chromecast using ADB. I can now stream movies, cast media and when the display goes to sleep it shows my own custom web page, perfect! These are the settings I had to change in case it helps others: adb connect adb shell settings put secure screensaver_components chyzinr.webpagescreensaver/chyzinr.webpagescreensaver.Screensaver adb shell settings put secure screensaver_default_component chyzinr.webpagescreensaver/chyzinr.webpagescreensaver.Screensaver",5,1,1.2,2020-10-19 12:37:26,"Nice work around. Does chrome cast have its own locked ""screensaver"" - is that what the adb change is for?",2020-10-19 14:45:45

Using this app on an Android X86 port. Works flawlessly on a thin client flashed with Android X86 with all the media center goodies installed. After a certain timeout period I wanted my Dakboard dashboard to show up and that isn't supported for a screensaver through Dakboard. This app works perfectly for that purpose. Incredibly simple to setup and executes flawlessly when the desired screen timeout turns on the screensaver. Excellent app.,5,1,1.2,2020-08-29 18:44:30,Thank you for the thoughtful review,2020-08-30 08:53:55

The app works as intended, I suppose except that it doesn't support iFrame embedded content that utilizes javascript. That's kind of a dealbreaker imo. But that's just for my particular use-case. Any thoughts?",4,0,1.1,2019-12-01 11:41:06,"I haven't tested that particular scenario, but I am working on getting better Javascript support in general . If theres a specific url that you're able to share for testing then I can try to ensure it works",2019-12-01 12:06:56
