I gave the free version a quick test drive and found it to be useful and beautiful. The touch interface works very well, and adds to the immersion into the virtual world. I want to stand my tablet up next to my monitors to make my desk feel even more like a cockpit.  The reason I probably won't use it much is that it's not nearly as powerful as inara and eddb. For example, the requirement of origins for loops, inability to sort commodity traders by sell/buy price (by arbitrary columns, really), restricting the module search to only one module. I'll give it a more in-depth test drive later, but those immediately stood out to me.  But, I'm seriously impressed, and very interested in how this app develops, so I bought the pro version. I'm looking forward to using it where I can. It really does add to the immersion. Kudos, also, on the caching. Nice engineering there.  I have some questions about data collection. Are you calling out to community APIs? Are you scraping yourself? Do you plan to share data you collect with the community outside of the app?",4,1,2.32,2016-11-17 11:57:12,"Hey thanks.
