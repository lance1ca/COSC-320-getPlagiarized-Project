Great usability. Screen zoom in/out works very nicely and does not steal focus or hide the keyboard. The quick-access keys (popup keys for tab, esc, shift, ctrl, super, alt + arrows) are a superb idea and well implemented. I hate having to bring the Android keyboard up or go into the menu, so this feature is highly appreciated. But I sorely need quick access to pgup, pgdn, home, end, ins, delete/bkspc etc. (and maybe even F keys) - it would be nice if users could configure which quick-access keys poped up (bit of work for the developer, though). The send-keys and send-text functions are also great and can be used for this, but you have to go into the menu. I used the free version for a week and then upgraded to pro because I think this app is worth supporting. Very happy and would like to see new features added (hint: more quick-access keys).
