The app does not have a location feature so it's really no better than pulling up the regular site. It's hard to navigate and hard to locate and understand the different types of plants.  Someone with a mind for development and the user experience needs to get involved. Wouldn't get it again even if it was free. The 3.99 price is a slap in the face for an app this bad.,1,8,0.2,2016-10-04 06:29:29,,
