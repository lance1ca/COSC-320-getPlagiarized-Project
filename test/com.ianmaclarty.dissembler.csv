I have it on iOS I don't have this game. Dissembler is a great game. I have no complaints. I came from my iphone to android bc I love the Pixel 4 XL. I bought this and will buy jumpgrid. I'll also buy a lot of this guy's games they are always top notch games for mobile. Thanks for making this awesome game. I plan on buy a lot of your games to help support the game making bc your games are great. Thanks!!!!!,5,0,1.1.8,2020-09-11 18:01:07,,
