the 15 min return period was expired) notified me that I needed their

Best options are permanent heart rate tracking and sleep tracking in combination with sleep as android, the latter being my main reason for buying this app. Sleep tracking works pretty well and does not drain the battery too much. If you have set up alarms in the Mi Fit app, they won't show up in Tools & Mi Band, but using both apps at the same time works pretty well. For constant heart rate check and notifications, bluetooth needs to be active permanently. Reason for the 4 star rating is, because steps counting etc is not present, so you can't get rid of the Mi Fit app completely. Additionally the statistics and charts for heart rate could be better and more usable. If you have Sleep as Android installed and enabled wearables to use the band for sleep tracking, bluetooth might be activated by the apps automatically.

So three apps needed when some, or as the dev refers to them ""competitive"", apps can do it all (one completely free).  [Edit: I'm able to use Mi Fit alone without giving it notification access, but it's required if I'd like to use this app. Some don't want Mi Fit running since it transmits data that there's no reason they should have. If it was possible to get rid of Mi Fit and add an option to activate SAA when this app notices that the user has or might have fallen asleep, or just constantly send data required by SAA for it to detect sleep it would completely change things.

Now my mi band doesnt show up as a connected bluetooth device, so I cant use it for smart lock.  I'm guessing thats the firmware rather than this tool, but frustrating nonetheless.    Also I find it annoying that you get spammed with vibrations now, you get two vibrations with the icon of the notification, then a vibration for each segment of the text of the notification, so this can be aroudn 5 vibrations for one message.  However if someone then messages you or you get another notiication, it interrupts the half dispalyded notification and overrides it with the new one, so for all of these vibrations you dont even get to see the message. I'm already looking at hthe damn watch, I felt the initial double vibration why do I need a million vibrations while I'm looking ath the message or if I'm in the middle of something.  The other issue is that the long messages are a bit of a pain to read in this small text in such a small view area.  I get this isn't really your fault, but it's annoying and I'm considering turning off the text notifications again.

Setting target of e.g. 8000 steps in Mi Band is ignored if native app is set e.g. at 6.000 steps. Seeing caller number in row of three? why? By the time I have read the called id, the caller has hung up. It's quicker to whisk out the phone (and vibrating consumes battery life). So what's the point? It's a ""A JE TO"" application. Czechs know what it is and we used to have fun watching the cartoon. In real life it's less fun. My fault, I should have been forewarned.

Sure it has a step count widget where you can place an icon outside of the app, but that just counts the current day. Where's my step-history?   In the official Mi Fit app, they have daily/weekly counts of your steps as well as average steps, down to the 'time' of your steps. Then a nice bar graph is shown. I wish this app would have all that so I don't need both apps. I feel without this function, it's not complete and feels like a 'supplement' (a nice one) to the official app.  Another feature on my wish-list is to incorporate friends' step-count.
