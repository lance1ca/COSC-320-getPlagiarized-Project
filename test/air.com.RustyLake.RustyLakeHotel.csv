I think the ending is what makes it so good because that's where it really ties into the story. I found the puzzles in this one to be a little more challenging than in previous Cube escapes, and I would also say that some parts were a little more disturbing than was typical of previous games in the series, but that's just me. It also took a long time to finish which is great.

It's a cool game overall. If you like the other 5 games, you'll enjoy this as well. Just spend the 2 bucks to support a developer that is doing something cool and different.
