I find it frustrating that you can miss something, and not go back and redo it. I finished the game before using all of the room keys on the box by the lift, so I've no idea what that does, and I'm not replaying the entire game to do it! And hard to tell if missing ingredients in the current room or have to get them before going in. Still a nice game, and I do love the entire set of games.

Not what I expected with all the reviews.
