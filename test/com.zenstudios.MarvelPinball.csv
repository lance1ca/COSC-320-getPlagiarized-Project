on my Pixel 2 XL and everything is scaled incorrectly so that the buttons 
are only half on screen, and the table itself is not quite all there. I 
tried on an older Lenovo tablet which does render properly, however there's 
quite a delay between hitting for a flipper and it actually moving which 
makes the game unplayable. The imitation LCD screen at the top left is hard
