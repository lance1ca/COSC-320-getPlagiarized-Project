Works great for school bingo, the kids love to use the 'real' bingo cage, so the board mode is perfect. And it works on my Chromebook! Just my thoughts... if/when you update the app: -A theme with higher contast on the numbers of the uncalled balls so it's easier for little kids to read them. -A ""bingo"" graphic to go with the buzzer when someone calls bingo. -A button for the home screen to skip the instructions.",5,13,1.2,2019-01-25 09:34:13,"Hi, Thanks for the review. We are collecting all your suggestions so that we can add it on our next update. Regarding the Home Button, do you mean a ""Home Button"" to go back to the main menu? You can do it by pressing the back button.",2019-01-27 05:55:56

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the graphics for the bingo balls. The glare on the balls make it hard to see on the ""O"" balls. Adjusting the brightness doesn't help. Please lose the glare effect. I use this app on 3 different computers 3 times a day. So it's safe to say I really do love it.
