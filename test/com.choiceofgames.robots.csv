I wanted to like it. The genera was intriguing and I've always been interesting in the Robot and A.I. world. Being a creator of both was obviously going to make me happily get it. Along with the amazing reviews of previous players. I was easily able to look past the hefty price tag. It must be good right?  In some aspects, it was good. Written beautifully. Great punctuation and spelling. And the story idea was captivating. However my play through was somewhat disappointing. I felt it was rushed, way too rushed. If it was done in a longer, stretched out manner, the age difference from when you start to when you end wouldn't be a problem. However, aging from in your twenties to near fifties in under an hour is not fun.   This may be a metaphor for life or something. “Life flashes before your eye's, so  enjoy every moment of it” is what I've concluded in my head. If this is so then I get it. But that is not what I want in a book. I wish to ESCAPE life when I read these interactive stories— or any book/game for that matter.  Have it been rushed I couldn't get close to any character, however I apparently did. How? I don't know it skipped that part. In the end I didn't find myself attached to anyone. The book didn't leave me thinking or emotionally damaged, just disappointed.   On the account of it being so short, this is an interactive story that is to be played multiple times. I just couldn't do it. If my first play through was less then impressive it clouds my decision to play again. I am not a multiple play through type of person. Especially when I doubt it's worth...  I'm not having a go at the Author. They have created a difficult thing and I applaud them for that. Just the fact that they got this out there is amazing. My problem is just how the story was set out. Like a full television season that has been trimmed down to a not-so-lengthy hour.    To conclude. If you are into multiple quick play through, and creating robots and A.I., then do not hesitate to buy. It is a good interactive story, if you don't mind the (quite) large plot skips.
