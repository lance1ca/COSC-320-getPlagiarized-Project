The towers tend to clash in appearance when put together, which comes from having 4 or 5 different races and themes on the screen at the same time. While there are certainly good looking elements there are too many bad ones to ignore. The audio is odd too. The background music is like 30 seconds long and loops throughout much of the game. I'd had enough of it by the end of the first level and then it plays for much much longer. Also the game has been even further mobilised with many more micro transactions and giving you cards with resources and abilities on them every level. Theres also the problem with the overall theme, but that's something I could look past. It doesn't make much sense for an invading army to be building towers defending a path but whatever - it doesn't affect the gameplay. While there will certainly be people who like the game, I found that having biker goblins next to joke telling demons next to medival knights next to fishmen reaaaaaaly put me off.

You get a good amount of towers to use. Some modes allow you to try optional towers (that you pay extra for) to see if you like it. You do not need to spend any more than $5 to beat the whole game.

Some people complain that buying all the things in the game is expensive but no one forces them to buy it all. There are tons of reviews on the net that describe the pros and cons of each and that they might bring some nuance to the game but are not necessary to have fun with it.   My personal feeling is that eventually all types of towers and upgrades map somewhat to the initial 4 types present in the very first game and one can come up with good strategies that work for them with any four towers mapping to the original four. Heroes are fun addition since a few releases for sure.  Lastly I love the cartoonish style and the fun pop culture jokes hidden around each level.

I have not spent a penny on any in-app purchases. I did not even buy the gem store items as I feel they are too OP and ruin game play exp.   Stage is too hard? Try different tower placements and combinations. Not enough towers? We now have 11 to choose from instead of 8. Heroes/Towers are behind a pay wall? ALL IAP are not required at all to complete the game. Not enough content? For the previous 3 games in the series, updates + endless mode has ALWAYS come after they release the game.  There is nothing Pay to Win in this game. NONE of the in-app purchases are required to beat the game.

It's sad that it is burdened with close to $80 worth of micro-transactions. This game is not a AAA title, and should not have a price that puts it in that league. Ironhide is even scummy enough to push you into making poor purchasing decisions by having a limited time sale to unlock heroes/towers at a discount. This is an amazing series that has really been ruined by greed. You pay for the game, and then find out that if you want all of the content it's going to cost you $80. I'd refund the amount I paid to buy the game in the first place if I still could, just to send the message that these practices are not acceptable. Do yourself a favour and pass on this game. There are other good games out there that won't require you to empty your wallet just to get what you paid for. Kingdom Rush Vengeance is the equivalent of buying a Ferrari for a decent price, but when you go to drive it off the lot you find out the tires are half full, the interior has been gutted, and someone replaced the engine with one from a lawn mower. Technically it drives, but you're not getting the experience you expected.  Has frozen several times as well.",1,501,1.6.6,2019-04-18 20:59:22,,

In fact, I found it easier than other titles in the Kingdom Rush series, some of which were nearly impossible in the final levels. I've basically finished each level after the first attempt, most of them with 3 stars (I'm talking about the casual mode, of course). Also, you've got plenty of towers and 3 heroes to choose from, without having to pay for the extra heroes and towers. Of course, having to pay for extra stuff after paying for the game is controversial, but since the game can be easily completed without those extra items and there's plenty of free towers and heroes to choose from, I wouldn't complain about that. The only thing I have to complain about - something which is common to all the Kingdom Rush titles - is the fact that in order to call a new wave you have to pan to the edge of the screen, which is cumbersome and annoying (hence one star less).",4,1,1.5.4,2018-12-27 07:56:45,,

The only Thing that has changed, that I really don't like is the new upgrade system. Most of the upgrades feel very lackluster. On top of that, you can no longer earn extra stars from Heroic and Iron Challenges (unlike in every other Kingdom Rush game). So you might wonder, why should you do those extra levels, which are more difficult? You shouldn't, because they don't give you any meaningful reward anymore, other than a few more gems, which is their premium currency. Heroic and Iron Challenges used to be something fun and challenging you could do in order to get some extra upgrades points for an early advantage. It was like doing side quests in an RPG game to get a couple extra levels before progressing through the main story. Now there is no point, unless you just want a few dozen extra gems I guess? Personally though, I choose to play without all the flashy cash-grab gem items, and just play the game normally. But to each their own, I guess?  EDIT: After playing the game for a couple hours I've encountered a number of very frustrating bugs, so I'll be changing the rating from a '3' to a '1' until they are fixed.",1,0,,2018-12-27 00:00:26,"Hi, thank you for writing!

Pros: 1. Wide selection of towers! This version is different from the usual 4 types of tower. In this game, you get to choose a variety of free towers that best suit your gameplay. I like it very much! 2. Easter eggs and references! This is one cool feat in kingdom rush series. Im glad that you didnt remove this one. I find it entertaining but can you give me a clue where to find groot? :) 3. Switching sides! I like this concept. Now I get to fight for vez'nan's side! #vengeanceforthedarkking Cons: 1. No fast forward button! 2. Not too challenging! I completed the campaign maps in veteran mode in just a few tries with perfect life and without the use of special items. I find it odd. Kingdom rush is usually difficult. But I am still to try the impossible mode. I want to buy some towers and some heroes but if its this easy, then probably I dont need to anymore. 3. Short waves! I need more waves so that I can max upgrade a tower. I find it short when I get to finish a map without even trying to max upgrade a tower and see it's full potential. If you can complete a map without the need of max upgrading a tower, then what are the tower's special abilities for? 4. No elite maps! This makes me very disappointed. There are only 17 campaign maps (too short) and I was really looking forward for the elite maps but there are none. Why? All the other kingdom rush has elite maps and their level of difficulty is very different from the normal campaign maps. Maybe sooner you will include it? I dont know. Please answer this question. I want to know :) As of now, this is my rating for this game. I will update my review once new contents are added. Again, I love your game and I am glad that you released a new version of kingdom rush. Thank you and more power!",3,1,1.5.2,2018-12-16 06:04:30,,

There's only minor deviations between this game and the others, and I even had someone ask if it was origins. (3) Requires additional payments to unlock other aspects. Similar to previous entries, you have to pay more to get some of the best heroes & towers. Pros: (1) Fun hidden details. Each level has hidden details you can find that reference various media from pop culture (Terminator, Lord of the Rings). (2) You're the bad guy this time. I was hoping there would be missions where you would send waves after waves towards the enemy castle, instead of just setting up towers, but no dice.

When I say throttling, I mean the fact that the challenge modes no longer offer upgrade points like the previous games. Which leads into the next issue. Short duration. The game is short and this may be the reason challenge mode no longer give upgrade points. This game is so short I'd argue the price of the game is rip off. The microtransactions are becoming an issue. I don't have an issue buying heroes, but now I have to buy towers?

So far with this release I am quite impressed. Well sort of... The gameplay and hidden easter eggs are phenomenal. Lending more gameplay and strategic awareness. My only gripe would be the difficulty. Well additionally the number of levels released thus far. I see there may be intention to release additional levels due to the map size and areas unexplored. I started playing the game on Veteran. The challenge wasn't as high as the other kingdom rushes. So with their new impossible difficulty I expected to restart over and over again. Well to my dissapointment... I was able to achieve 3 stars on first playthrough on some of the mid levels. I still haven't completed every level on this difficultly but so far I'm not impressed. I love the game but the challenge just isn't there. I usually purchase the dlc to help with challenging levels but as of now there is no need to buy the additional towers other than for aesthetic purposes. I understand the dlc for characters since that's something they've always done. But for towers....blatantly a cash grab. You will already win over new customers with the high ratings.

This game is just far easier than the previous titles. It's just doesn't require as much effort to win in this title. The iron challenges are nowhere near as difficult. They used to require careful tower choice/placement or else you would get steamrolled. Even after completing the campaign and unlocking the Impossible difficulty setting.... It still felt easy. Easy to the point where I had gotten half way through an iron challenge and thought to myself..... Maybe I didn't put it on Impossible 🤔 (I had). I love kingdom rush and the studio behind it.....

They've put their own flair into every single piece of art in this game and you can tell that every part of this game is crafted with love and attention to detail. The controls are tight but not unforgiving. The game is hard but not unbeatable even for the first time player. Kingdom Rush is also my 10 year old daughter's favorite mobile game for that exact same reason. I have no problem paying $4.99 for such a well polished product.

It suffers by comparison because the previous games were so amazingly well done. I think they want to evolve and not just repeat, you see that with the space game they did too. Ambitious, well crafted, but still awkward. The art is great, but somehow less engaging. The upgrade system is a step in the wrong direction. This is sort of the Diablo 3 to the Diablo 2 that was KR 1, 2, and 3. And somehow it just feels slower and not as well paced and more awkward and clumsier, and more random and less balanced. That last may be due to having fifteen different types of towers, the strategy on your end and on theirs just becomes a mess, because neither you nor they have a clear idea what you'll do with a map. Maybe the game is fresh and needs more patches to refine and that's all, but after so many stellar entries you would expect they would have that down.",3,7,1.5.2,2018-12-02 21:10:23,,

I've never seen an app so horrible unplayable at launch. How a simply tower defense game can be so unstable is beyond me. Theres no point in me spending gems on anything since its a total risk as half the game i play crash once the final wave starts. Domt even bother trying to minimize the game because the moment you do it will crash immediately. Also have to start the game 3 times to get it to actually run but worst of all wss the final boss. I saved up so many items with gems justi n case and used several of them in the boss fight, get through both parts and when wave 18 ends. Nothing. The game sits there, nothing happens,let it run for 10 mins still nothing. The characters just said their scripted lines over and over and enemy mortars just kept hitting but nothing else. A game breaking bug that prevented me from winning and now i dont know if i should even try to play this game anymore its more frustrating than fun.",1,0,1.2,2018-12-01 00:29:32,"Hi, please contact us at www.ironhidegames.com/Support giving us as much information as possible for us to fix the issue.

It brings in a new tower selection mechanics that I quile like. It feels better and more strategic than the previous same-til-upgrade split decision from games past. The story is fun and inventive, and as always the art direction is fantastic. However, I can't help but notice amist all the new and improved, the lack of some of the hallmarks of the series. Gone is the Dictionary/Bestiary providing information on the enemies. Also, there are no bonus levels unlocked across the map once the campaign is beaten. Once the campaign is done, that's pretty much it. Upgrade points are now static, so there really isn't an incentive to play the challenge modes on the campaign levels beyond achievement hunting. I do hope that the game is updated with more levels, but I really wish they were included on release, like all the other KR games.",4,22,1.4,2018-11-29 12:32:28,,

I don't like the new tower system. The old way meant you had a total of 8 different tower types to work with in each map. And that was made even better by each tower having a unique identity and use. And they all synergized well together. Winning wasn't about towers, it was about combinations of towers. In the other KR games I almost had at least one of each tower type on most of the later levels.  With this new system the tower design feels decidedly less polished, with many towers seeming redundant or outright useless. Putting half of them behind a paywall doesn't help. And only being able to have 5 limits options. I still go back and play the original three KR games regularly, despite long since maxing out all the starts on the hardest difficulties on them. This new one felt short, no side missions, I beat it in about an afternoon, and I feel no urge to go back and replay any of the levels after beating them like I did in the previous titles.   The other games have all provided me with hours of enjoyment, this one I completed more out of an obligation and will probable rarely, if ever, pick back up.",3,1,1.2,2018-11-27 13:36:38,,

Still awesome as before in all aspect, gameplay, details, storyline, easter egg, music, you name it. To be specific with some noteworthy points,the whole tower system has been changed andI like it alot. While it limits the possibility of more complex combinations (only 5 specialization at a time instead of 8), it adds another layer of strategic planning pre-battle. The new skill system is also a nice improvement. I like the idea of having different route to choose with really make we think which set to choose situationally although it is still limited to just one node. For ppl with already veteran level skill, the impossible difficulty might also be a nice addition. Still there are some points I think could have been better. The achievement is as grinding demanded as ever, some achievements are just straight ridiculous. 30000ds from a crow tower skill with 4dps for example. There is not really any strategic value of such achievement. While I like the new idea in the boss battle alot. They are actually way too easy even at veteran (I know we have impossible level, but previous KR boss fights are always intense). For some reason, there is no encyclopedia, which is a disappointment especially for hard-core fans. Last but not least, selling heroes is ok but selling towers is abit overboard, not to mention the already existing gem system. I mean, look at the price, the game itself with all the contents cost even less than 1 paid tower, that is ridiculous. If you want to have more support, fans will for sure purchase some gems and all the extras. Heck, I am willing to pay 10-20 bucks for the game itself, it is definitely more solid and engaging than many other games. But the fact that players know the game experience will be restricted by some paid DLC is not nice. Still, it is a great game and a must have if you are into tower defense.",5,3,1.2,2018-11-27 11:50:41,,

It's crashed multiple times going to any of the menus (heroes, towers, shop, etc.). It's also fairly common for it to go to black screen, still playing music and sounds, but being unresponsive, forcing a restart. The latest is I unlocked the third hero, went back to the first boss to get three stars, crashed and now he's locked again, despite him having reached level 7. I thought I would continue but I can't start the first snow level without it crashing. I've already bought all the heroes and towers and I don't want to refund the game, so I'm just going to sit and wait for this to be fixed. However, this is the fourth game of the series and these kind of game breaking bugs are inexcusable even if they get patched out later.

This one felt like there was alot less content and alot more premium content. I even splurged for the tower pack thinking that there would be alot of levels to conquor but to my dismay there were no bonus levels to play in this version with only a short campaign. The ending seemed like there would be more levels to come but i havent found any other content unlocked after completing the game with 3stars on each level. Unfortunately i can only give this game a 3 star rating at this time because it is still quality but not worth the full price. I am sorely disappointed in this series development and wont be purchasing any more from it.,3,1,1.2,2018-11-26 06:06:21,,

I also think that the prices for these towers and heroes are a bit steep (11$ and 20$ Cad respectively for all of them). Going forward I would much rather pay more upfront for the game then have more IAP being added for future installments, as I understand that quality games do require quite a bit of time and cash to make.

If Ironhide looks at this comment, I dont want them thinking its not a good game, it just needs to be improved a little bit.

Only Oloch the free one and the Black Dragon are good heroes. And why can't we unlock veznan when we beat the game? Disappointed. Bring back other heroes and improve them. The evil looking ones.

I have also supported the series throughout the years. What i am dissapointed in is the fast that the game has become a cash grab. The core attraction of the game are its towers yet the developers feel they have to lock the best towers behind a pay wall. Previously having to buy heroes are bad enough but now we have entered the zone of pay to win. I did infact purchase both the hero and tower bundles of the game but i feel extremely cheated on. The devs have the decency to charge such a high price for the game and make their customers purchase even more to enjoy the full game. Upon purchasing these packs the game felt extremely easy and therefore it was clearly pay to win. I feel cheated on and sadly i will never be able to get a refund for those packs. Greed has unfortunately ruined what was once a great game series.,2,7,1.2,2018-11-24 15:47:12,,

Being the villains is truly fun, the heroes have a nice selection (Asra is my favourite character of all the games), the towers are cool (shadow archers 😍), and the new system is interesting. I wish the game was longer and you had more to do. There wasn't any levels where you could use guest heroes. There was an opportunity to use even more notable old heroes as enemies. I don't mind the purchases but hopefully new side quests/maps are added on.

If you liked the previous ones then you will like this one. The problems with it lie in signifigant content is gated even though you payed for it. Like the previous games, there is paid heroes. This was never the high point of the series as it limits the gameplay oppurtunities for most people that don't pay dozens of dollars extra. There are now also payed towers as well. This is even worse signifigant gamplay elements are now blocked out. They could have fixed this issue by having them be bought for signifigant portions of in game currency. As an example, every dollar could be translated into 1000 gems. In this case all of the purchases would be able to be bought for 3000-7000 gems. This is significant amount but can be accessed through enough gameplay. Unfortunately, in order to have access to the rest of the content, one needs to pay 52 dollars to buy all of the heroes and towers on release. None of these can be unlocked through gameplay. There are good things about the game though. The tower system that they implemented is really interesting and something I almost want to call good, if you could access all of them without having to pay additional money. The free heroes are not that bad, especially Asra. She is probably one of the best assassin type hero in all of kingdom rush. Oloth gives good magic damage and is a decent alternative. The game also is also visually really good as it runs really smoothly with what seems like better animations. The game is also harder, which is good for veteran players of the previous games. However, I cannot help but feel that this is meant to be exploitative towards newer players. If they are having trouble on recruit difficulty, the first thing they see is an add for a bundle which is always displayed on the map screen. Overall, I can't recommend buying it in its current state as too much is within a paywall from the start. I understand that ironhide needs to make money but they are heavily limiting gameplay oppurtunities and variety for additional revenue. Personally, I don't enjoy the direction these games are going and hope that they change their mind. Luckily the problems can be fixed relatively easy. The developer could add a way to get heroes and towers eventually through in game play, as mentioned earlier. Another good way would be a premium pass of sorts that automatically gets you all of the heroes and towers while removing the bundle advertisements. Ideally, this would also get you future heroes and towers. If something along these lines get implemented I will change the review to 5 stars.",3,1,1.0,2018-11-23 17:07:41,,

It's better than ever and seems so far to be the most polished installment in the series so far. My only gripe is that it's also the most monetized. The $5 price for the game is more than fair, but I was not thrilled to see gated content -including premium towers, a series first. It would be less bothersome if the game didn't also reduce upgrade options for towers. Unlike prior games, this time towers do not have upgrade ""trees"" that allow different level 4 options. Instead you get a 5th tower slot and can swap out towers between maps. It's an interesting system that presents some new possibilities, but the reduction in the options for each individual tower seems less like a design decision and more like an arbitrary way to push premium towers sales. There are no ads, though, and there is no strategic need for the premium towers, so it's hard to give the devs too much grief for this. They do deserve to be compensated for their good work. I'm giving it 5 out 5- Kingdom Rush has long been one of the absolute best mobile game series and Vengeance continues that legacy of greatness.",5,0,1.0,2018-11-23 06:41:56,,

I really like the idea of having to customize your own towers and that's good though the cons of this is that there's no other 2nd tier to choose from so it's the same thing all over again, but to compensate for that, you get a 5th slot for a tower (as well as having different towers to choose from) and this changes the meta, like which tower should you choose for this specific situation? I really like that and it is very nice. New elements are added in and that is very good too, maybe in the future, we'll get towers that synergize directly with each other. Example: Laser ability from Artillery, Portal ability for Mage, get those 2 together and you can combine it for a Portal Laser Barrage thing, once the Laser passed over a certain distance, it will be teleported back to a certain spot and continue going on but this is just an example. Thanks for this! Great tower defense games as always.",5,1,1.0,2018-11-23 00:56:42,,

This new release has quite a few reviews of people being angry at the idea you have to buy towers but you dont need to. As a reference there a lot of free tower defense games that blatantly copy ironhides design and are probably earning a lot more and being way more greedy/expensive than this new Kingdom Rush is. Yes the content is expensive but it's completely optional. I for one plan on purchasing all the extra bits to support one of my favorite game developers out there.

Its just as charmful and humorous as the the previous 3 Kingsom Rush games, which new and old players will love. However the fact that this is the most expensive Kingdom Rush to date, coupled with the fact that FIVE towers are locked behind a paywall is ridiculous in a tower defence game. Where the core of the game is coming up with different strategies using different towers. Having heros locked behind paywalls was fine in the past and still is, as the free ones are more than capable of beating everything in the game. Purchasing these heros was a nice way of supporting the developers more whilst not effecting gameplay in a huge way. To purchase all towers and heros along with the base game will cost $30, which will never be worth it for a mobile game. Ironhide have fallen into the microtransaction trap, along with many other once great developers, now turned greedy. Disappointed. A simple solution would be to change the ""premium towers"" to cost a large amount of in game currency. This gives the player the choice to grind for them or to pay for them.
