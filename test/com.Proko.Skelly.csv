I love the easy interface and everything about the app is wonderful and simple BUT the inability to save a pose or export it into an image file makes this far less practical for me. I'm using this on a large phone but it's still difficult to draw from such a small reference and it's a real battery drain keeping my phone on to maintain one pose.,3,18,1.0,2015-05-06 16:46:47,,

Easy intuitive interface.  I wish that Muscle anatomy, along with pose save option may be added on to this, so that it can become one of the top reference applications in the World!

Been waiting for app like this for years ! Hopefully it will someday include possibility to save your favourite poses, to add muscles and maybe mini skelly (for drawing kids) or even better an option to adjust size of individual parts of the body and height. Surely there is a LOT of promise here. Even in its current stage its still best thing ever - don't hesitate, buy it ! You wont regret it !",5,1,1.0,2015-05-06 01:05:43,,

Posing, navigation,  and lighting is super intuitive! I suggest Android users avoid relaunching the app via shortcut, as you will lose your pose. It will revert to default pose. Keep it open.
