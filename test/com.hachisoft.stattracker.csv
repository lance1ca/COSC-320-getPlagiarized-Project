Stats are more comprehensive than other apps I have used and the shot graphics are nice. Suggestions for improvements: Group stat buttons by category Defensive – Reb, block, steal Offensive – Reb, Assist, TO Fouls Add light color code to stat button (red for TO, Fouls and green for Reb, assist, etc.) Undo feature to roll back entry mistakes. Bball icon gives access to history, which can edit or delete items, but not player subs. Allow player sub corrections to be made in this window as well. Additionally, simple undo button to sequence through last entries would speed that process up. Also would be nice to have configuration option for the undo button to automatically reset clock to time of last entry (useful for those entering stats off of video) Bench – when in landscape and you access the bench, the screen rotates to portrait. Leave in landscape and divide players on floor to left and bench list to right Add report to excel. Can copy and paste from the html, but formatting is always a mess to correct, as it tries to enter stats as dates or assumes a fraction and converts to decimal.",4,1,2.3.25 (448),2019-11-22 09:58:03,"Thanks for your suggestions.

Would be better, in my opinion, to have it to where you let go and then select stat.

Also nice to have, a way to ""tag"" events as they occur, perhaps with quick text. Since I am taping the game as well I can then quickly look up the event on tape. All in all, the more I get used to it the better it works. The quick sub by holding by long pressing works better than the sub menu, which is too slow. (also I dont like the sort by number, because i'm always looking for the name, not the player number).  For forced turnovers, I am just using ""deflections"" to track any hustle stat whereby the defender does something good, but where it may fall into a forced turnover rather than a steal. After googling deflection is a good way to do this. Deflection doesnt go into the efficiency ranking, for better or worse, but at least its tracked.",5,2,2.2.7,2016-11-28 14:17:54,"Hi Frank,

Also, sitting with someone who can help when things get crazy is nice. For me, an interested parent works nicely.  When you first start try what I did. Instead of using 5 players per side, I only track 3 players total as follows:  #32 My Son, #10 Teammates and #20 Opponents (other team). That way you only have to switch between 3 different players. Still keeps you really busy when the action is fast paced but it's manageable. Then as you get faster you can add a player. But, don't think you will track all players accurately. It's just too much.
