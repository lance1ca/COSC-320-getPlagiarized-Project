Unfortunately the app suffers from multiple bugs, typos and a poor AI system. Worse than those things though is the bizarre dictionary. Otherwise obvious words to English speakers aren't counted in favor of three different spellings of a form of Hindu ghost (true story).

The game is great. It is scrabble mixed with star realms in a novel theme. There are some issues with the digital version gameplay. I would rather see the hands flow out in real time. The summary screens are annoying AF cuz you have to tap them away after each turn. Music is super awful. The best deck builder game so far in digital format is the ascension app. The game in this app should flow like it does in ascension.,3,3,1.0,2019-09-06 18:41:21,,

cards as wilds. The push your luck mechanic also work well. But the Genre 
cards are what break this game for me. Very often it becomes who can 
cumulate the same genre cards fastest win the game kind of scenario. 
Doesn't really matter if you spell any long impressive words because a 
3-letter word of the same genre can worth 10 stars. And if your opponent 
can spell 3 or 4 of those you lose. Other than that, I think it is a fun 
game and it is different enough from Paperback. But I think Paperback is 
more fair. By the way, can developer please add an undo function to buying 
ink please? Sometime I wanted to sell ink but pressed the wrong button for 
buying instead. Can't seems to find a way to undo that.",4,0,1.0,2018-08-05 10:28:56,,

test out the mechanics before taking the plunge on the physical copy. I'm 
having issues though when I zoom in on cards to read the fine print. When I 
use the zoom feature on opponents cards it will occasionally freeze the 
card data and there isn't a way to minimize it again. I have to close the 
game when this happens. It also happens during the purchasing phase. I'll 
pull up a cards stats and the try and do the same for another card and none 
of the cards on the market are responsive. I can still usually buy ink at 
this point, but usually it is best to just restart the app.",4,9,1.0,2018-07-27 09:43:15,"Hmm, when this happens again, can you look at your in-game logs by opening your menu. I send any errors that happen to show up in the logs. If you find something send me a screen shot. Mesisos@gmail.com
