I enjoyed the original version minus the Achievement glitches... I'm not going back and replaying it for a fourth to see... Hopefully this latest update has fixed all issues in this second version. Both games are excellent storylines and have lots of puzzles to solve.

For instance, using hints will break the interaction of items with the environment. The only solution I found was to completely restart the game. Annoying, but manageable. More severe is another bug I just encountered, basically preventing me from progressing in the game. One of the red plugs for the ticket machine just disappeared.

I actually replayed the prequel before starting this game up, and while it's not required to have played the first game before playing this one, I highly recommend it as it adds to the story. And what a story it is! Comparing this game to the last one, I felt like this one was longer, and the puzzles were definitely more complex. There is a terrific hint system, but I hated how often I had to use it (quite frequently, as compared to one time during the entire prequel). Some of the puzzles were also a bit monotonous (like the pillar one). I also noticed some glitches. The game force closed several times (suddenly closing to the home screen with no warning). And during the final cutscene the game decided to go into a weird sort of portrait mode right when Libretta hugged Laura, and stayed in portrait until just before the credits rolled, which rather ruined the ending for me (I didn't move my tablet at all, so have no idea why the game tried to force itself into portrait mode). I also noticed a handful of errors in the subtitles (several misspelled words and one case of an extra word being inserted). All these things make me think the game should probably still be in beta. BUT - it's still a truly terrific game, and one I'm glad to have played. I'll probably return to play it again someday - and as someone who rarely finishes games even once, that says a lot. Definitely worth downloading. I just hope the issues are fixed before I do another playthrough.",4,1,1.0,2017-12-02 07:44:51,"Hi Brooke, thank you very much for your detailed review.
