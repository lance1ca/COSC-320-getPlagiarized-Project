The best thing next to VR. Bought it for MSFS but I have made good use of it on other games with headtracking but no VR support - F1 2019, Arma 3, etc. No issues at all with a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite. Tip for new users: make sure to setup the axis curves and thresholds on Opentrack so you don't have to rotate your head away from the screen. Exaggerating the camera movement is a must for headtracking and feels completely natural, so you can have your camera look 90¬∞ away from the center with only a 30¬∞ head rotation.

For combat flight sims this is crucial and quite annoying when it doesn't work. Secondly, it would be helpful to have a USB communication to lower the delay which is OK at the moment (at least I hope a different communication would help). Lastly, the stability is OK as well, there's quite some work to be done here to improve it - maybe it's not possible with a face recognition algorithms.

Went through the setup instructions for the app and PC and got it working in MSFS2020 within 5 minutes. A few very minor issues only. If I use multitasking on my phone and switch back to SmoothTrack, the video feed is just black and I have to restart the app. At very shallow angles, it has difficulty measuring the distance to your face. If you turn your head too much, the position goes back like 10 feet.",4,8,1.0,2020-09-11 09:09:06,,

I was able to test SmoothTrack with both X-Plane 11 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, and it's true to its name; the tracking is incredibly smooth. I also own ViewTracker, and even after tinkering with those settings dozens of times, this app works far better and requires almost zero configuration.

I've probably tried all other options available for cheap facetracking (didn't buy trackIR) and this is 100x better than anything I've tried. Life changing. I am using it with DCS and MSFS and having zero issues. Low light performance is awesome (only monitor light) on my S10.
