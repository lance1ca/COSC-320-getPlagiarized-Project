And most of the downside falls on UI and control.  The buttons are so tiny, the words are so tiny. It's impossible to read the label of heroes to summon, it's impossible to read what's the upgrade cost. This game would be OK if played on PC with NOX, but on a small screen, it's not enjoyable. Want to swipe up that card to upgrade that low HP hero? Whoops, missed the card, the whole screen just flew away and your hero died. Want to circle heal your heroes when you just gathered them together? Whoops, missed the heal because I clicked on the damage skill instead. This is a mobile strategy game, not how accurate you can push small buttons game.  A few other smaller complaints: game speed not adjustable/no check points. On longer levels and you lose to boss or you missed 3 stars, it really adds to the frustration that you just have to start over again. You can't skip or speed up. At the end of the day what matters is if the game is enjoyable, and for me, although the art and graphics are stunning, the poor UI and gameplay makes the experience frustrating.",3,0,1.1.7,2018-02-16 07:00:01,,

Fantastic artstyle. Unique mechanics. And most importantly it's just a lot of fun! I've rated it 4 stars for a few reasons, most notably because the controls can be a bit fiddly. The ability to zoom in a bit more would probably help with this. My second complaint is that I can't go back to earlier levels and use my new units or upgrade levels. I just feel it would make for some more longevity and fun to go back to earlier levels with new options. Honestly that covers it. A couple of minor issues in an otherwise fantastic game.

Would have been better if i can create a team of 6 char and be able to maximize each char to its full capacity. That would be enjoyable. Also.

I beat it Fairly Quick but so fun, and worth the $ 100%. Would love for an update so I can download again and play new content. I would greatly appreciate More levels, More Heroes to unlock as well as costumes (In game Money to purchase them). 2 Skill trees for each hero type. Permanent Upgrades. And possibly PvP. I know that's a lot but do not expect it to be done now or in one update but whatever you can do will be greatly appreciated by me and I'm sure others also! Thanks for the Great Game!",5,0,,2016-10-28 08:08:12,,

To elaborate, my disappointment is because, with original art concepts, this could have been a truly unique thing that would have been yours. I don't think it's far-fetched when I say this game rips-off, or at least heavily leans on, the art direction and menu/upgrade systems of Kingdom Rush. The game's premise is great, and with original artistic direction it would have been phenomenal. Every aesthetic aspect to me leans heavily on Kingdom Rush, from the animation and menus to level and unit designs. This game has certainly piqued my interest in you as developers and like I said, I'm impressed with the game itself, so I'll be following you guys in the future. I just would have really loved to have seen you really run with original ideas instead of relying on derivative art concepts for what could have been a  TRULY unique twist on what's becoming a stagnant game genre.",4,3,1.1.3,2016-03-22 06:46:58,"Update: Thanks for elaborating on your reply as well!

The entire game is worth a good 10-12 hours of gameplay but could be more. There's some story elements but overall the game has little repay value. There are challenge mode options but completing them is necessary to unlock new summons than to reexplore a level. The difficulty of the final boss fight is ridiculous; attack zones need to be better defined for the player.

I am having a lot of fun playing this game. There are somethings that I think need an alternative method or tweaking. For example, It is a little hard to pick one unit when they are bunched. Also when you move a unit like the knight it doesn't agro anymore creating problems if they are poorly positioned by the way they rotated just walking down the path or just letting them get to your ranged units. Knights should still agro when moved small distances (I can see why not allowing that in long moves is smart). or maybe an agro skill! I like how when you upgrade units they gain new abilities not just health & damage. I like the look and sound of the game. Though some back buttons aren't visible on my samsung galaxy note, they still work but are not visible. One last note an endless mode would be a great addition.

Their form is almost immediately recognizable - simple, yet stylish designs, rounded characters, new or altered takes on classic games, and customizable gameplay despite a linear story. Each and every game they have released sports these characteristics, and Tiny Guardians is no exception.   Allow me to summarize. Tiny Guardians is a game where you, the player, follows the path of Lunalie, the Summoner, as she journeys through a world searching for her master, the Sorceress, who has mysteriously disappeared. Along the way, you must protect Lunalie from a wide variety of rather numerous hostiles, choosing from a selection of fighters in order to achieve this goal. These fighters (your ""guardians"") are upgradeable, allowing you to choose a strategy which fits your playing style.   Overall, Tiny Guardians is a well-made game. The only drawback I've seen is the limited number of levels. There are enough to keep you hooked, but when you finish the game, that's it. I suggest adding another chapter to solve this.",5,4,1.0.3,2015-04-27 16:48:32,,

The semi-customization of the characters is a breath of fresh air. There's a level of difficulty attached to the game, which means it requires you to really strategize. I'd love to see some added voice acting, and increased gameplay speed. Overall, you should really play this game! I've played so many tower defense game and this is definitely one the best out there!",5,2,1.0.3,2015-04-17 19:20:04,,
