I enjoyed the ability to import my hero from Heroes Rise: Prodigy using the Choice of Games save-game server. However, I felt that I was at a disadvantage due to choices made in Prodigy which I could never change in this game. I was really, really frustrated by this game when I kept getting thrown out of the competition for what seemed like petty reasons. Early on in the story, getting voted out of the competition ends the game. In the end I opted to spend the Â£0.63 or so to purchase the MeChip warning system, which would give advice about the best choices or tactics. Without that, I would have spent several restarts figuring out the best combination in order to stay in the competition. I couldn't get over the annoyance of every little decision having huge consequences in the competition. Everything I did seemed to upset the judges, and doing one thing would upset a whole bunch of people, no matter which choice I made. It felt, to me, like this game was a struggle, and I can only hope that this was because of the relationships/stats of my imported hero rather than the story itself.",3,0,,2016-04-06 06:25:01,,
