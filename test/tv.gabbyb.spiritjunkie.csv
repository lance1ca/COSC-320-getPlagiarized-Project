I don't get notifications or reminders until I open the app itself. As a healthcare provider in a crazy covid world I would love a daily reminder to stop for a moment, read the affirmation and center myself...sad that this app can't help me with that. This has clearly been an issue for awhile now; I think it's time for an update!!!",2,3,1.2,2020-12-04 21:27:59,,
