Strongly recommended to pick this one up",5,4,1.11.13,2021-01-09 05:58:28,,

Long story short, I've been playing for two straight weeks and can't stop. An incredibly deep game with some complex strategy, but all you have to do is play and you figure things out as you go along. If you're in a hurry to learn then you can go to reddit or the wiki, but those are NOT necessary to progress. Also, this is the way mobile games should be done: base price of the game is cheap, and there are NO ADS! There's a whole bunch of IAP, some cosmetic and some game-related, but I've looked the latter over and they don't seem to be necessary, in fact I've unlocked many of the items just by playing the game and earning achievements. So, it seems that most IAP is there for impatient players with large wallets. There's one exception: the reasonably-priced expansion pack that includes a new game mode. I may buy it, but if so that'll be well in the future as there's a whole lot more of the basic game left for me to play.",5,26,1.11.06,2020-08-21 19:48:43,Thank you for your review!

Tania is the pick for you, she can even make burning-enemies explodes, consuming all their burn-stacks to multiply their dmgs by 300% Wanna make a spooky-dungeon in which you focus on debuffs and making your monsters immortals? Rebecca can curses enemies to explode after their death, cursing and dealing dmgs to all thoses around the victim, and she can momently make monsters immortals And finally the game always reward you for playing it Your lords become stronger everytimes you use them You unlock new items, monsters, and traps And you the game even let you keep somes of them into the next-game The only thing i can really reproach to this game is the sound-design The music-loop get really, really repetitive after a while And the monsters and adventurers noises gets absolutely annoying really fast It's a small-thing considering how great the game is in it's entirety But i still advice you to mute the music, and put the sounds in ""decency-mode"" if you really want to keep the noises It will replace the screams with ""beep"" and ""boop"" noises Overall, it's a great game highly replayable, you can basically build your dungeon however you like it get challenging but always fair, And you never feel frustrated after losing a game it's a actual quality-mobile game, And it more-than-earned the 2‚Ç¨ i had to pay to buy it try it yourself",5,2,1.9.61,2019-11-11 05:41:54,Thank you for your review!,2019-11-11 16:49:13

Gameplay is a 10, replay value is a 10, graphics are a 8, sound and music are a 4, uniqueness and memorability are a 10. I had originally given it 1 star, but that was too harsh. This game deserves the love and recognition. <3",5,1,1.9.5.1,2019-10-15 12:33:20,"Sorry for the inconvenience.

I would recommend instead reducing the cost of these packs to about 5$, and allowing these to be unlocked through the challenge mode so that there can be a fun but difficult way to unlock them.  -Increased daily login rewards for players at higher levels.  There has already been a lot done about login bonuses, and I really appreciate that, however to someone who might be getting hundreds devil stones at the end of a run, the current login bonus of 20 can feel a bit obsolete, so scaling would be nice.",4,1,1.8.4,2019-07-15 12:02:08,,

Welp, let's get to it. This game is literal eye-candy for lovers of this developers last game-- dungeon defense both in terms of gameplay and visual aesthetic. Newcomers will love the art and gameplay as well, every character has its unique distinction in terms of skills and appearance and the fusions are both logical and each provide a different layer of strategy for your dungeon building. I suggest looking up a guide on how to make your dungeon synergyze well with the dark lord you're using. Now for why I gave this game three stars. Everything I just mentioned is marred by the slow rebirth stone gain, as opposed to its predecessor, DM sometimes makes you give extra effort, just to get 10 stones per run. Plus you lose most of the goodies you got since starters don't have any successions or storage, and the packs are complete RNG. The login system was a sweet relief but its limited to what I think are 14 tries per month, when it should be month-long and increase the stone payout for consecutive logins.. The point is, the slow stone gain mars the gameplay and visual aesthetics almost entirely and forces you to either buy the IAP or grind tirelessly which gets boring quickly.",3,1,1.6.2,2018-12-05 21:44:22,,

I've just scratched the surface so far as unlocking, and I've sinked in 50+ hrs. (30 unlocks is all it got me)... don't expect that ratio to continue though. It get harder and harder to get the crystals required to unlock. I rated the game based on the IAP grab.

You can own both and be satisfied with the differences. This plays like an rpg ccg meets board game. Dungeon defense more of a tower defense game. Both are worth owning. This game is pretty fun and involving but seemingly somewhat simple (read: deceptive). You start out going through days that are set represented by cards. So, for the first day you have 3 cards in front of you to choose, what you choose from there are determines your next choices following day, most often, you'll find yourself in battle which is the meat and potatoes of encounters, occasionally you can choose other cards. Battle is pretty straightforward and, until you level your boss up, almost feels like an idle clicker, after the leveling, however, things gain more depth. This is a hardcore game, so, be prepared to die often and hard. You'll get incentives to die if you hold off on it long enough though, so don't waste your time intentionally losing. All and all, it's worth the price of admission (same as dungeon defense) and I'd highly recommend both games by this dev, especially if you'd like to eat heroes for lunch for once :-D",5,3,1.5.7,2018-11-09 20:57:13,,

To be more fair, most of the upgrades are ridiculously minor. The pixel graphics are cute, but they don't save this game from ultimately being what it is -- a chore. It's a slog. It's uphill both ways in the snow without shoes. It's a grind. It's a tedious tower defense in which the units can only attack enemies that are directly in front of them and in the same square. It's mindless restarting. Enhancements to your units are so minor that you may never notice them. Because there are so many available upgrades, it gives the ILLUSION of a lot of content, but it's just not there. You obtain premium currency at a snail's pace and you never even know that you're going to earn any at all. The wiki is almost useless. It's... it doesn't matter. It's not a great game.

Snappy loading and overall UI combined with the above induces One More Turn Syndrome. Juxtaposition of evil and chibi works well (see Disgaea). Myriad ways to customize your dungeon even before you start unlocking stuff, and there's a ton to unlock. Progress feels like progress, which is great, but it's very slow. This is the only gripe I have and it's an unfortunately huge one: the painful grind for in-game currency and no option to purchase it. Unlocks are done through loot box card draws of 3 between (currently) 4 sets at different prices. A run that takes you an hour will likely net you none or enough currency for 1 of the cheap ones. A several hour(!) run might net you enough for between 5-10. This game would strongly benefit from making this less painful considering it's already a paid app. The devs would profit from making the currency purchasable as well. Still, the variety in gameplay and challenge modes make for some serious replayability.",5,2,1.5.5,2018-10-17 04:10:37,,

Clicking 5 times on the post game screen can kinda dull things. Loving the updates and hope the prison/prisoner functions become more flushed out. Honestly there needs to be more of a beginner tips and rules section in-game about that and a few other things. I honestly didn't understand how it worked and after trying it out/reading up on it on reddit. It seems like other people dont really like it or feel that it needs to be implemented better. With my lack of knowledge at this point I just get rid of the prison facility and worry about that after I have my dungeon and monsters sorted out. Post 100/200 days is about the time I decide to re-install the prison facility into my dungeon where it's not so easy to lose prisoners,4,10,1.5.6,2018-10-17 02:22:29,,

In the less than 3 days I've spent well over 20 hours on it. I'm addicted and simply can't stop it's a good game. However, I feel as though rebirth tokens (currency for card packs) aren't plentiful. Now I don't have trial mode so not sure if that drops it but after the initial round of tokens they just don't drop anymore. The missions that grant them aren't repeatable (from what I see) so it makes it semi-hard to obtain. Don't get me wrong I love a good grind fest myself but you should consider releasing a stable way to earn them since we did buy the game to begin with.Given how RNG can make or break you it gets harder to stack rebirth multipliers (Currently on 6). Also can there be a separate pack for dark lords? Trying to get a dark lord (god forbid I get someone to spice up this game) from a pack of over 100 card seems a bit unfair. Nonetheless, the game is worth the few bucks. Tons of playability and lots of strategy. Prepare to drop it though until the devs fix the glaring problem that is getting new content through packs...",1,0,1.4.6,2018-10-09 23:51:55,,

Learning the game mechanic is fun and soon you learn how to manage your dungeon and effectively deflect heroes. It is kinda confusing at first when you see a lot of monster fusions as well as trap fusions which are locked and you can't get them without unlocking them and I wish you could hide or exclude those cobinations from the list while you haven't unlocked them. Also I wish it was faster to read books to get buffs for monsters, demon lord or traps because getting a book to begin with and then spending 3-10 ""turn"" to finish reading it is kinda annoying but I haven't unlocked much stuf so maybe some artifact helps with that. As well I am still learning what to do with prisoners and torture mechanics as I feel I am missing something or these mechanics are kinda useless (unless you unlock some of the stuf from later packs) which I wish would make them hidden until I unlock like torture tools and other things as you ignore them anyway.

Not perfect as nothing is but this game could have some work done. First and foremost, a proper tutorial would go a long way. Most things you can pick up easily but the corruption still confuses me a bit. I had gone to black market and corrupted a hero there and it gave me a 2 star imp, I was very confused and thought I had just spent all that time for an imp and it turned me away from it, it's only recently that I learned you can properly corrupt then and have them fight for you so I'm trying again. But a tutorial would really help clear this up. That really is the only problem I can clearly see with the game so far. This is an idea that I had a little while ago and thought I'd suggest it here. For the next update you could add in a new Dark Lord. My idea was an Arachne Queen who's whole focus could be around inflicting poison and effects that increase damage over time or something All in all, keep up the great work, consider my suggestion maybe, just giving a spitball idea and good luck, I hope the future is good for you all ^_^",5,0,1.5.3,2018-10-06 07:38:25,,

You're the Evil One here). Simple concept, but that's just the surface... heroes have skills they can use, and of course your monsters have skills too; the first skill they have beign their own unique skill plus up to four other skills the monster can learn randomly as they level or learn through MONSTER FUSION / ENHANCE. Also, rooms have special effects that are applied to monsters/heroes; and your monsters can wear equipment to make them stronger. Then theres Special Fusion for UNIQUE MONSTERS and Combinations for SPECIAL BATTLE ROOMS. Also, special encounters and elite heroes give RELICS that add even more options for the dungeon such as ""All-Monsters Buffs"" and Debuffs for invaders. Then... your Dark Lord is not a mannequin! Unleash Dark Lord's Special Skills and impact the battlefield to make victory look like a possible outcome when dozens of heroes roll in through the door of your Lair. There is so much more, so many things to make each game played an unique experience since maybe that relic or monster you found before will not appear on the next run, not to mention that there are more than a few Dark Lords to choose from, each providing a different playstyle and strategy according to their skills.

I know it's newly introduced, but right now it's not very viable past some basic necessities like gold income and random stat bonus books.

It's a climb the tower style rpg with elements of dungeon building and strategy. It's a full length game on your phone in this style to boot. If you're not a fan of grinding RPGs then you might not be as big a fan as me but I find it wonderful and well beyond worth the price. I have only made it to depth 300 and have not unlocked hard mode yet, nor do I know how yet. That said, this game has me excited to find out how. To the developers: Thank you first off. Secondly there are a few things I'd enjoy in future updates if you see fit. Just one guys opinion of course. The option to buy books from the merchant in the same style of the facilities. The option of reverse auto deploy. Let me elaborate; some dark lords work better with weaker monsters on the front lines such as stacking regeneration so the back lines can tank more. This one isn't a big deal but there is a graphical glitch where if you go to fuse facilities then back out the highlight for the ones you looked at stays overlaid under another option is selected. Lastly a bigger hit box for the secondary dark lord skills. My fat fingers miss too much. Hehe. All that said, wonderful game. 5/5",5,0,1.4.6,2018-09-07 09:46:53,,

up. The arena used to boost attack and now it boosts defense. And the traps 
that I unlocked don't show up on the pre game start, how ever I'm still 
able to use them in game. And it kind of sucks because I wanted to get the 
achievement for making it to level 100 without using any two stars or 
higher. However I can't do that because once you get past level 5 with your 
heroes you are given a five start monster and you can't choose whether or 
not to bring them at the next start. If you could fix that I'd really

Every single battle is the same. The fun in this game comes from collecting relics and trying to make a specific sort of build based on what you can get, but once you get a certain amount of days into a game you start getting so many relics and minions that it doesn't feel like it matters what build you have. You have everything, and you have so much of it you can't spend time micromanaging every little thing (which is fun when it matters) because It would take forever.  --------This is why I was a little disappointed to see such a big cash shop in the game. I like that you are incentivized to play multiple runs but I feel like the life of the game was drawn out way past its welcome so that the developers could have a cash shop. That's not what I was hoping for when I paid for this game. But oh well. It was fun until I got burnt out on it. I just wish it was a more pure and contained strategic experience instead of devolving into an automatic grind fest.

If you're not willing to pour üí∞ into microtransactions, skip it. 
Progression is very slow, which I assume is intended to push the 
microtransactions. We all know that mobile having is a cesspool of empty 
gameplay and microtransactions, but this one is no exception. To give you 
an idea what you're in for, I just finished a game where I made it to level 
440. Levels probably average 30 seconds each, so that's about 3.5 hours. 
Input is required between every level, so it's not like you can just let it 
run for 3.5 hours. I got 20 ""rebirth points,"" which are what you use buy 
progression and unlock game options. There are two ""packs"" of things you 
can purchase, 140 for 10 points each and 98 for 15 points each. That's 2870 
points of unlockables. Based on my experience, 10 points per hour is a 
pretty good rate. That's 287 hours to unlock everything! That's for a paid 
game! Unbelievable. It could actually be fun if progression was 10-20x 
faster. As is, it quickly turns into a slog that's not going to be remotely 
enjoyable unless you start putting serious money into unlocking things. The 
gameplay is not inherently satisfying, so the game is really all about 
progression.",2,0,1.3.7,2018-07-16 14:01:07,"Thank you for playing our game.

Their also some weird UX design choice. Here the things that I am just not sure what to do: If I equip someone with armor, can I unequip it?

be a play style, but it is REALLY hard to keep your boss leveled up in line 
with the current dungeon level. Obviously, the point of this game is for 
you to NOT kill everything as just your main character, but this is bad 
enough to where a situation comes up, which is explained in my second 
problem: There is a game breaking bug where enemies will often simply run 
straight through your monsters. I had just unlocked thetis and had two 5 
star moneters at my boss' doorway, and the enemy ran right through it, then 
killed me in 1 hit. Yes, I had enhanced my biss several times. I was lvl 
29, I believe and had cleared maybe 4 zones or so? Enemies being able to 
run through your monesters defeats the entire purpose of the game.

wish people would stop giving 5 stars until they are resolved... 1) 
translation. Not a big deal. Incorrect translations are an annoyance at 
most. They are easily resolved with a bit of trial and error as long as you 
remember what does what. 2) dear God the grinding. This is a premium game 
so they already get your money. Locking so many powerups and only getting 
ONE, IF YOU LEVEL UP is crazy. Grinding to level up takes way too long. It 
takes hours upon hours of straight playing to feel as if you make any 
progress. A disclaimer that you can obtain all the powerups for free is 
nice, but it loses it's meaning when the developers feel that spending 100s 
of hours on a premium mobile game is ""fair."" It's just more disguised 
greed. I enjoy the game, so I'll keep playing when I need a time killer. 
But, I'll be waiting for them to actually give me a reason to grind. 
Hitting day 100~200 (about 40 mins i'd guess on average) then MAYBE 
leveling to get a RANDOM choice of items kills this game for me, and it 
should for you too.",3,0,1.2.2,2018-06-18 12:00:55,,

a life potion after fighing an elite map, is triggering the chance for two 
relics and both of them turn out to be life potions... Seriously?The relics 
are also so specialised and random that in any game, only 10/30 relics
