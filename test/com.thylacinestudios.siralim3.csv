Later on I was again told that I would like Siralim 2 by the same friend and eventually--awhile after it had been out--I gave it a chance and loved it. However, it wasn't that long after I was playing it that Siralim 3 was announced. I waited for it to go to mobile as I lack internet for my computer atm. And after one of my random Siralim 3 searches in google apps, it showed up. I didn't hesitate at all to buy it right then and there and I am loving every minute of it I play. It has a somewhat customizable main (you have preset sprites you can change into). A vast array of monsters you can raise. So much loot you can find in the way of artifact equips, spell gems, and various other boosts such as runes & cards. And the Gods are genuinely interesting in how they interact. Maybe because Nex seems set-up for helping them rather than how Siralim got their assistance, they seem much more fun to see and do quests for. Oh, and the music is amazing. Maybe I had my music too low in 2 but in 3 I love the music and don't want to just play my vocaloids over it while I play. So overall, a damn great game that any monster raising game fan should get. Our game genre keeps dropping off (monster rancher, jade cocoon, and so on) or never coming to the west (dragon quest monsters joker 3) so a gem like this needs love and support. ^.^",5,3,1.0.16,2018-11-01 13:02:14,,
