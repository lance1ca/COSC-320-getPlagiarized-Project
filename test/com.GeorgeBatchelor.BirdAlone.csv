This whole ""come back the next day/later"" is a ploy to prevent you from refunding the purchase right away. Great if you want to see creator names every time you open the game, I guess these will be important names and we must see them few times a day. The whole bird experience falls flat fast.

I feel like the team really captured the feel of a parrot. The noises, the movements, even the pining of the bird's eyes made me think of my life with parrots. The bird is charming and I like that they need time to think so you're only doing a few things a day which really makes the experience cute and not overbearing. As you hang out with your bird friend you'll do some quick drawings, help write poems and jam with some music tools. It's charming and I found myself smiling when I got a push notification from my bird, Millie.",5,5,2.3.7,2021-01-08 09:29:07,,

Visually and audibly is great. Plays well on Android. I love checking in each day and offering advice to my friend. The bird is well written and has a good sense of humor. Spoilers ahead. The ending was sad but solidly done. You end up getting a new egg one day after the bird passes away that serves as a game reset. It’s a shame. I would *like* to tap the egg but I know it’s just going to go the same way. And I don’t think I can put myself through that again. 100% worth playing.,5,4,,2020-09-30 10:42:44,,
