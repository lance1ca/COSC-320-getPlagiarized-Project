With some glaring holes and oversimplified (there are hundreds of species of eucalypts not one). Description is pretty lacking with some. Not all include pictures. The pictures included aren't great for identifying the plants. Can't them view full screen. This app has a lot of potential but I feel like it really is in beta,2,13,1.0,2020-07-21 04:23:00,,

Some plant information states that there is too much to write about said plant that would fill the page but only gives one information.
