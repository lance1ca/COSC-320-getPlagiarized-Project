Super convenient  and easy to use. The ability to just pick the work piece material and have it auto calculate from tool size/material/coating is amazing.,5,1,1.18,2013-10-23 11:33:34,,

I work in a  prototype shop making one of akind parts. I work with lots of different types of metals. I can't remember all the different settings for speeds and feeds. This app gives me a good starting point. This is the most extensive, informative app out there. It is well suited for the beginner or pro. Thanks for a great app!",5,3,1.15,2013-08-28 08:58:07,"Thank you.
Reviews from experienced machinists like you matter especially much for me.",2013-08-28 19:02:54

Only one I found that allows you to select the material that you are working on rather than inputting numbers from a separate table. I am a student machinist and I do not know things like the ipt for different materials by heart so this app is perfect. The way the UI is setup allows for quick recalculation for different depths of cut. I definitely recommend.  The one feature that would be great would be an option for extended tool life rather than the absolute fastest rpm and table feed,5,0,1.09,2013-08-12 10:32:57,"Hi, Thanks for a great review!
Good idea. Normally you can control tool life by changing cutting speed.
Say a 25% reduction in cutting speed will very often yield 2 times increase in tool life.
I will add several buttons in ""Overrides"" tab that will preset cutting speed for better life or better productivity",2013-08-12 18:18:00
