With SmartReceipts I can scan a receipt as soon as I get it, when I've got a layover, or in the hotel room.  This literally saves me several hours a month next to the office scanner.  I love the ability to email myself the PDF report of my receipts.  I merge the report with my expense report PDF and I'm done.  Love this app.",5,0,1.1.7,2012-03-15 18:29:23,,

I had an issue with force close on ICS on my Asus Prime. With other apps I would have lost all my data but this update managed to keep it all. Can't wait to try the new features.,5,0,1.1.6,2012-02-27 14:49:55,,

Huge time-saver.  I take pics and log receipts as i go during my trips and then directly send an email to my admin.  Would be nice to have the ability to customize output a bit more but the beauty is how simple it is to use.,5,0,1.1.6,2012-02-25 09:11:36,,

Initially rated as 4 but changed to 5 after the developer included my suggestion on the next release. A+,5,0,1.1.6,2012-02-21 13:58:38,,

Other than that I really like it. Helps the road warriors!!,5,2,1.0.1,2011-11-05 19:12:09,,
