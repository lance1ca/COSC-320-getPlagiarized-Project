The only downside was pacing, with the climax being a bit disappointing. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game. I enjoyed playing it, and it was worth every penny of the 5 dollars I paid for it.",5,8,,2019-05-20 05:30:12,,

Would be 5/5, however it has some techical issues: 1. on multiple occasions hotspots are too small on mobile to tap (garbage processor puzzle was very frustrating) and 2. Saving system often looses progress because it's checkpoint based. It's usually a small amount to play again, but still frustrating. That said, I do recommend this game to all point n' click game lovers!",4,19,1.0.0,2019-05-19 07:47:15,,

Voice acting is great, but just overlaid on non-moving faces. Augmentation system is innovative, but don't like how path is triggered through dialogue choices. Story is good, but not at all original. lt also seemed a bit short, dialogue heavy and puzzle light - I got through it quickly and there were maybe 2 interesting puzzles, which doesn't make me want to replay.
