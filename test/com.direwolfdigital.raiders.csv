With the advent of the digital release, I opted for that version instead of the physical one, since I already own several ""worker placement"" games in physical form.    Pro's (Four Stars): The game is great all the way around.  Not only does it include the fully featured game, but the tutorial in combo with the manual (in settings) is clear, concise and easy to understand.  The graphics and animations are top notch but not distracting.  Cross platform play is nice (I am on android and my friend is on iOS).  I love how you have two online gaming options: live play and timed play, so you can play a friend live and in the moment, or come and go for turns, depending on which option you choose.  The AI opponents and campaign play are nice additions that are well thought through.  Con's (Minus 1 Star):  There are two much needed updates for the Android version.  One is that when I login on different devices with my Dire Wolf Digital account, the progress or games with the campaign/AI are not transferred.  The second is that notifications for android are not working.  Once fixed, I will update to 5.",4,6,1.0.3,2019-08-06 05:55:37,"Hello,
