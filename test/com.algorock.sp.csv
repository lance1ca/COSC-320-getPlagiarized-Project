I had over $1000M cash, no investors and 95% marketshare. When I retired the End Screen said my company went Bankrupt!! ðŸ¤¬ The game will also error if you have an investor offer at the same time as the pop star event. I got stuck on a splash screen having to reload over and over until I was able to smash a split second popup button between investor screen and pop star event. Very frustrating! Game is fun but the bugs RUIN the awesome game ðŸ˜¥",1,11,3.8,2020-12-09 17:37:58,,

All of my features were above a 7 and I still instantly lost. Very frustrating. The game could use more clarity around the objectives and which stats are needed for each feature.,2,3,3.8,2020-12-09 07:44:19,,

There's a part in the game that you are required to have at least all your features above a 7 rating. I made sure yet I still got the gameover screen. Not going to play this until it's fixed. Huge waste of time.,1,6,3.8,2020-12-08 17:39:55,,

One of the best tycoon games I've played in a while. A few suggestions maybe with the training part there should be a group one as well it's waaaaay too tedious to just tap every time into three menus and same goes for the marketing side.,5,4,3.8,2020-12-06 10:36:45,,

Really enjoying it so far. It is challenging but as long as you continually evaluate your priorities for growth it's manageable. Have not run into any bugs yet.,4,11,3.8,2020-12-04 09:17:17,,

Implementing features and working on contracts is a guessing game 90% of the time. And if you get the ratio wrong, it's extremely punishing. Another annoying part is adding extra employees to a task increases the time rather than reducing it. Your income is not stable at all, and things can easily swing into the negatives, workers need way too many vacations... Basically the game is extremely difficult, and complex.",3,28,3.8,2020-12-04 01:57:54,,
