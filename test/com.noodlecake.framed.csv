PLEASEEEEEE GIVE US MOARRRRR!*  *alternative ending*  *quivering bottom lip* Please, Sir, could I have some more?  Framed was on sale in the Playstore for $0.12, so I figured why not? It's just twelve cents, and if it was awful the option for a full refund within was available if I submitted for the refund within 2 hours of download. Needless to say, I loved the game and decided to keep the app. However, that was prior to me realizing I was going to complete the entire storyline in about 6 hours with roughly a 4 hour time span that I did not play the app. In all I played for about 1 gout upon download completion, put my phone down/went out for about 4 hours, and then returned home and played for another hour (if that) only to realize I had finished the whole game. That being said, I could have played for just under 2 hours straight immediately after download completion, finished the entire game, and then redeemed my full refund. Despite that realization, I would still highly recommend this game to anybody, really. If you enjoy comics, graphic novels, puzzles, strategy, or just want something to pass a couple hours that will keep you occupied and entertained this is it. The levels play like a live comic strip, there are no words, but there is an awesome, silent film, private eye themed, jazzy soundtrack playing in the background. I recommend definitely playing with your headphones in to truly appreciate the entirety of the experience the developers created here. What caused this app to miss the 5 star mark for me was the lack of any instruction at all on how game play would progress which leaves the user in a 'figure it out as you go' situation. Perhaps that's meant to be your first obstacle of the game. Haha! The other aspect of this app that failed me was the short length of game play created for the user to enjoy. In future versions, please consider creating multiple chapters, or 'issues' in keeping with the comic book theme. Another thought might be to create a ""choose your path"" type storyline. For instance, the user would approach a fork in the road, each of which would alter the outcome of plot. I am going to take a leap of faith and download the newest addition Framed 2, and see what changes have been made in the new edition of this game.",4,25,1.4.3,2017-11-29 07:41:57,,

The story is uninspired but reminiscent of the ""Film Noir"" genre, so it's not all that bad. The controls are responsive and your actions are input immediately, which is important for the later levels. There is a fair amount of challenge, and there are mechanics added throughout the game to make the gameplay different and slightly dynamic. I only payed nineteen cents for this game, and I could see why someone would be slightly let down if they payed full price, as the game is very short if you're good at it, but it should last most people two to four sittings. Artistically it's great, though one can see from the screenshots that it's also uninspired in the artistic department. This isn't to take away from the animators, but rather to note the obvious ""Film Noir"" style. The character movements look good, but I would love to see a mechanic for people on other panels reacting to noises, though not on screens with a lot of panels. Altogether, it's good, it's different, it's worth a buy.",5,1,1.3.2,2017-08-29 19:08:34,,

This game usually costs around £5, but I bought it on offer so didn't cost a lot. Great game, great story, BUT very very very short. I think it took me less than 5h to complete it and at the end you think it's end but you not sure so you keep playing. I kept playing and realized I played this level and this one. So there is end to this very short story, but it's not clear what happened. Now, you can't play different sequence if you want to, you can't go back to whatever level you want, you just have to play right from the start to the end and so on. Final verdict: Game itself is not worth even when its on offer and definitely not when is full price. You just running and running from cops and trying to put squares/pictures in correct order. I liked it, but end will come to you before you realize and it's end and you can't let's say play this and that story. NO!! You just have to start from the beginning making it boring. So after you finish this game you just have to uninstall it. I am very unhappy, that I did spend money on this very short game!
