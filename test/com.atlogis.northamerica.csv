Making new points is extremely tedious as the ""-"" and ""."" keys are in secondary menus 2. ALL points regularly disappear off the map and must be reloaded 3. When points are reloaded it brings you out to a world view and you must zoom back in to where you were working 4. User location does not automatically update and, therefore, it's easy to to lose track of where you are 5. Only cached maps that I'm aware of 6.

So I bought the Pro version. The  first and only app I have ever purchased. And it was even better than I thought. I had been using a Garmin Oregon and Base camp.  And always had to fight with it to get it to do what I wanted, and  frequently lost.  It may not have voice activated anything or traffic, I haven't explored that.  But I don't need any of that to navigate. I use the app to navigate on my motorcycle expeditions and it is perfect for that. If you tour on a motorcycle you absolutely need this app.  Furthermore in the area of support, you will never find better. I all of a sudden had difficulty importing routes and e-mailed them about the problem. Three days later there was an update up that fixed the problem.   Maybe Garmin should hire these guys to fix their worthless  products!!!",5,21,4.5.17,2017-11-08 10:24:27,,

Actual in-app street-nav would be nice, as myRouteMap does using the Google routing engine. ""Tilt map"" view is nice too when driving a route, but not possible here. Google Maps and mRM can use these capabilities, why is it not possible within this app? The weather overlays haven't seemed that helpful or detailed so far.

It works very well. All the important functions are there. As long as you have gps input you will be able to record your track while en route. You can also plan and create a route, offline.   The database of maps available is extensive and includes multiple options (including open source and esri databases) for identifying trails and where they fork, with good enough accuracy.   One basic thing the tutorial fails to mention, is that in order to activate a route, the app needs to find the GPS. Your android phone or tablet has a setting for location. This of course must be turned on. But the key is to make sure that the accuracy setting (a location option) is set to 'on/high accuracy', and not set to 'battery saving mode'. This will  ensure that your device's GPS will be found, which is what the app needs to see - in battery saving mode the app can't find the GPS because the GPS isn't turned on. Your device only gets it's location input, in battery saving mode from your network connection.  That said, everything should work as described. The alternative to a geo-referencing application, such as this one and others like it, is to take a photo of the trail system you are hiking and reference it wherever a fork in the trail appears. If the trail is marked accurately, you could use a compass and time the distances from point a to point b, at intervals along the way (dead-reckoning). This is okay, but if the trail forks are unmarked or missing, it's anyone's guess where you will end up.   Electronic navigation is great as long as the trail maps are good and as long as your GPS has coverage. Since you can download and cache maps in this app you won't have to worry about a wifi connection to load your detailed maps while in a remote area with poor wifi or cell coverage.  I like the options that this app presents and I am giving it a 4-star rating, instead of 5 stars, because tech support from the developers of this app, is poor. They never returned an email technical request for help, on enabling the 'start route' or 'go-to' function. The app works well but you'll probably need to be a reasonable trouble-shooter, on your own, if you can't sort something out easily. Don't expect any customer service. For instance, it took me a while to sort out that the location setting on the device needed to be set for high accuracy to  enable to the 'start route' or 'go-to' functions. This wasn't described in the tutorial or help sections and tech support was unresponsive. Too bad.  But overall, it is a very nice little app, and think it is well worth having if you spend any time in mapped wilderness or remote areas and want to confirm that the way you're on, is the way you intended.",4,4,4.5.9,2017-09-24 10:03:42,,

I use it mostly for hiking and have not had any issues with it losing its GPS signal unlike the previous app I was using. A few suggestions for improvement...the ability to export/share/backup multiple tracks at the same time (in GPX, KMZ, KML format), the ability to see tracks across different devices (sync type function), the backup/import process is a bit on the cumbersome side, especially for someone who may not know how to navigate through their device to find the backup file, and a free floating zoom. Sometimes the zoom is too small or too big since it snaps to a specific size. While hiking, being able to minimize the app while tracking progress would be a plus. It's possible already but using the back button brings up a dialog saying the app will close (something to that tune).  While I do see room for improvement, overall, this is a well functioning app that I didn't mind paying for.",4,3,4.0.7,2015-11-08 07:50:05,,

I just used this for a 650 mile offroad trip and was pleased with it.  Though the text on the maps is difficult to see while driving, even on a 10 in tablet.  Well worth the very low price.",4,1,1.0.0,2013-07-03 12:14:15,,

Can't see elevation of GPS points (don't know if that's a function of the GPS on my phone). Won't download all the maps in the zoom area visible and won't recognize the mobile network to do this.

I quickly added way points for my upcoming trip. Problem is the 'pro' version (or any of its versions that I can see) will not allow you to zoom in enough for hiking purposes. You can expand with two fingers and see the map resolution is there but once you let go it springs out.  This is a deal breaker in my opinion.,2,2,1.0.0,2013-05-23 08:18:33,,

When coupled with my solar charger and extra battery pack it makes field work a joy. Bringing together what would normally be several pounds of field guides via other apps with this now as a high end GPS, well, in short this is stunning for those of us that grew up in the age of the abacus. To then bridge it further with radar overlays (when cell phone service is available) in this app is just the cat's meow. I tip my hat to the developer(s). I have no problem zooming in or out, or any other functionality. I'd encourage anyone even remotely interested in using quads on their tablets to give it a try and save themselves the $350 a high end GPS would cost.",5,0,1.0.0,2013-05-21 10:09:20,,
