Open dosbox and C drive should be running from your new dos directory, from here you type the command:  cd dune (example of file name within dos)   And then type the games execution file, example   duneprg.exe (for dune)  And off you go.

Virtually no game is smooth or playable. And no, setting cycles to Auto doesn't help - stutters happen no matter what I do.  - The on-screen joystick only works properly if the game supports it - which lots of DOS games don't. You can't bind the on-screen buttons to keyboard commands either - huge missed opportunity since it makes most games unplayable without a physical keyboard.  - When using a physical mouse, you'll have both game and Android cursors on the screen at the same time, both moving independently. When the Android one hits the edge, the game cursor stops dead. Plz hide Android one and make the game one continue to move when an edge is hit because many mouse games are unplayable now or extremely frustrating.  - screen scaling should be allowed multiplication - 2x, 3x, 4x - like in real DOS. Right now it's 1:1 or full screen. Smaller issue but still worth mentioning.  I'll adjust the score if things get fixed - the stutters & mouse being the biggest flaws.",2,0,2.1.11,2014-01-27 11:49:44,"Sorry you are having problems.

As for AnDosBox, it used to be a good emulator but recent dick moves by the developer of AnDosBox against DosBox Turbo is childish and petty. I own both emus and would have like AnDosBox to have been continued to be developed like DosBox Turbo since they both had their own strengths but as it is DosBox Turbo is now the All-In-One package and add to the extra free addons to this and it really shines.

It has tons of great features for tweaking speed, graphical/audio quality, and interaction with each specific game.

For those of us who really know what we're doing with Dosbox, there is even a manual mode for creating individual .conf files for each game to tweak them beyond the variables that are changable via the Dosbox Turbo UI. This is great for me because this is the only way to hit the ""sweet spot"" on a few of my games because audio pre-buffer, block size, and sample rate aren't currently editable via the UI.

But first thing I did was hit the fit to landscape button and it worked perfectly.  Onscreen controls, I can also use my external Joystick/mouse, what more could I ask for ... simply fantastic.  Also... I have one more thing to say, this EMU costs 3 dollars, the alternative costs double, because one needs to buy their Joystick onscreen EMU as well.  DosBox Turbo is the obvious way to go.  It doesn't matter which is slightly faster, no way I will spend (or my wife would let me spend) 6  dollars or 7 dollars on a Dos emulator.
