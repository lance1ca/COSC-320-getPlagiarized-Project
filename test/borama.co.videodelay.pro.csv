Chromecast should be built in, not using screen mirror which mirrors the whole screen and therefore make it laggy. If Chromecast was built in it would only send the actual video speeding it up. 60fps not supported on my phone even though I can do slo-mo in my camera app at 480fps.",3,3,1.140,2020-09-22 22:37:01,,

But unfortunately doesn't work great for high movement sports because no matter what I try, I can't get the FPS that I put in settings. Lower resolution, less time delay, set the fps to 30, try different render... It's all the same laggy experience. This means in fast movement sports like gymnastics we miss about 50% of the frames where corrections would have been applied. I know there's a slow-mo option but we can't keep going to the phone and hitting it. It'd be nice to have to set it and forget it.",3,3,,2018-09-24 12:35:28,"hey, did you try with api2? also which app version are you referring to? what do you mean about slow-mo option? Set it for example 3 seconds, and it keeps buffering / replaying no need to touch phone. On my MotoZ and Nexus 7 2013 I'm getting 30fps without problems. Some android devices don't output selected fps especially in low light.",2018-09-24 14:41:41

Thanks for your feedback! I briefly had option of recording videos on android, but it worked well only on some devices...
Please contact me @ boramaapps@gmail.com - I can send you version with recording, it might work on your device. Also let me know what kind of lines do you mean. Thx",2018-02-16 03:06:39
