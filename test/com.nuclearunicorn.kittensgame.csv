idle/incremental games fanatic (A Dark Room, Candy Box, Junction Gate were 
all huge faves of mine), so I went in without expectations... My, am I 
impressed. I don't even know how long I've actively been playing. Probably 
close to a month. I find myself checking my phone often to check up on my 
now-small town, advance my society, and aim for the new age ahead. From a 
simple lost kitten in a catnip forest to a thriving civilization exploring 
across the continents, developing new technologies and pushing through 
scientific barriers. When the game started feeling slow, my civilization 
well into its second millennium, I started over again, with a better swing. 
I was fearing that resetting would feel grindy, but instead it felt 
invigorating, this time with knowledge of what I was doing, excitingly 
awaiting the moment I will walk into the unknown. The lack of graphics have 
not bothered me one bit, it instead made me want to imagine and draw what 
my civilization looks like. For a fraction of the price of ""modern AAA"" 
games, you can get ten times over the gameplay time and then a lot more. It 
is an incredibly slow game but absolutely NOT grindy at all. It's a game of 
patience and Zen, strategy and planning. Recommended for anyone with the 
child-like desire of discovery, or the wise mind of a city builder, or just 
the desire to let go, relax, and stroll leisurely like a kitten in a catnip

A little over a year ago, I did my first reset on a civilization I actually cared about--I had over 8000 in game years, and no deaths (that time around). I took screenshots, wrote a post from the perspective of my Leader Kitten. The only thing I was less than happy with about the game was that the format of the game page didn't work on either my phone or my tablet very well. I could only really check the game when I came home to my computer. You can imagine my glee, then, when I realized you had made a mobile version of the game!   The post on tumblr mentioned there may be some bugs left-- so far, I've only found one, but it's fairly notable: after getting several buttons on the Bonfire screen (around getting workshop and/or mining, I'm not sure which triggered it), the Gather Catnip and Refine Catnip buttons seem to have disappeared?  On the other hand, this may be user error, I'm not really sure. I thought I'd better let you know, to be on the safe side.   Really just. Thank you again for making this. I was initially surprised that the mobile version wasn't free like the desktop version is, but I wasn't upset, by any means. After a moment of reflection, I'm glad to have repaid you at least a tiny bit for all the fun and story fodder and such you've given me. I don't recall if you have a Patreon or a kofi or just a PayPal donation link on your tumblr, but I'll look for it, and when I'm a little more comfy in my own funds I'll send some your way. Like I feel silly for how much this game means to me? I haven't played for several months because I got frustrated at an attempt at iron will... I'll know either not to try our to be more patient if/when I try that again.  Just. Yeah. Thanks.",5,1,,2017-04-02 01:24:02,,
