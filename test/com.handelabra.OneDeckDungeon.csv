screen on startup"" bug. *On Kindle Fire HD 10* Still gave 5 stars because I 
still have it on Steam and it's a great game. # Update# Seems to work just 
fine now. Thanks for the response. This game is challenging and fun. Takes 
about 30 to 40min per dungeon deck. The only downside is that the deck does 
get a little repetitive after a while. In the deck you will only encounter 
obstacles (traps), and enemies. It would be nice to see Events with various 
character or dungeon effects, and maybe a valuable Treasure Chest here and 
there. The all female character thing is a little odd too, but the game is 
still great. If consider removing the pre-built fixed gender and let the 
player choose. However, this is the adaptation of the card game so I doubt 
the developer has any changes or updates I mind. I look forward to other 
developers who might take these concepts and run with it.",5,2,1.1,2018-07-04 06:07:26,"Great to hear you're back in action, and thanks for updating your review!",2018-07-04 06:09:08

Not sure why but many times the dice are offset to not even be on the 
square blocking view of what you have left. For the cost I expect better",2,0,1.0.1,2018-06-12 04:10:21,"Hi Kendra, 
If dice are not locking into a box, make sure there aren't any uncovered armor boxes. You cannot cover a non-armor box until all armor boxes are covered. If you are sure you've dealt with all armor and are still having trouble, please contact us at support@handelabra.com so we can help figure out what's going on. Thanks!",2018-06-14 09:22:08

dungeon crawl where you roll dice to over come encounters. Sounds simple, 
but it's not. There are items that give you more dice. You can use potions 
and skills to adjust you rolls. It is all about building a combinations to 
create a character that can beat the boss waiting for you at the end. You 
will not master this game the first time you play, but what fun would it be 
if you did. Overall steep learning curve, but we'll worth the time invested.",5,0,1.0,2018-05-29 21:00:40,,

else mentioned, the tutorial leaves you with quite a bit still unexplained, 
but several games in I'm finally beginning to feel more comfortable. I 
still don't understand everything, and there's a lot of trial and error, 
but I look at it as part of the roguelike experience of learning the game's 
ropes. I do think there is quite a bit of depth and replayability in using 
different characters in each dungeon, unlocking their skills, and trying 
different strategies, so if I manage to stick with the game long enough to 
truly feel I understand it, it will probably be on my device forever. Just 
beware the learning curve.",4,1,1.0.1,2018-05-28 20:41:45,,
