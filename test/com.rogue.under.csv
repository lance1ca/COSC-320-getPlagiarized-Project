You can walk through walls, fall through the floor, glitch to all kinds of places you aren't supposed to be able to access. Throw in terrible graphics and make sure the controls are bottom notch too, and that's how you make a 1 star game. Would have given a half star, but could not.

The terms of agreement was a bit much on the privacy intrusion side. Despite that I accepted the terms and started my first new game. there does not seem to be a tutorial I don't even know what the heck to do. The instructions on how to move are nice but not really a good tutorial. So far the game is bland and uninteresting and I'm tired of wasting my time on it if you collected information from my mobile device delete it now the game is now uninstalled.,2,4,,2020-11-04 16:37:02,,

Overall this game was really good from start to finish. I enjoyed the creepy vibe it gave off throughout. Not many mobile games have a decent amount of scare to it and this one pulled it off just enough. The only gripe I had was sometimes interacting with items was a bit buggy. Was not a gamebreaker thankfully. Great game and I look forward to more stuff from this team!,4,27,0.1.0,2020-11-04 15:33:12,,
