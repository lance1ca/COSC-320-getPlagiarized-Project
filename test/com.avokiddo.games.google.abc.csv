On the home screen it pops up a ""more apps"" button that inevitably grabs the child's attention, who taps on it to see what's there. That button leads to an ad screen promoting more of the developer apps. This is unacceptable in a paid app for children.",2,7,1.3.5,2020-09-07 03:26:08,,

Would be nice to have a choice of narrator to go with us/uk spellings (I've never heard and way ""apricot"" like that before!) but understand that is much more costly to develop. The biggest issue is that kids can drag the letters in any order when spelling, I would prefer an option to force writing the word left-to-right (you know like we do everywhere else).",4,1,1.3.5,2019-08-20 04:33:54,,

He really likes to play it and it is helping him learn his letters.  I realize you can jump to any letter manually, but I think it would be good to have an option to either start the game on a random letter instead of ""A"" every time and/or move through the letters in random order.  Overall, excellent, high quality game and well worth the price.",5,13,1.1.2.1,2016-02-15 10:45:59,"Hello Scott, thanks so much for your kind words and feedback! The app actually does support the random order. At the bottom of the panel where you select the letters, there are two pink round buttons. Click on the ""random"" button and from now on you will move through the letters in random order. I hope this helps. Thanks again!",2016-05-05 07:35:38
