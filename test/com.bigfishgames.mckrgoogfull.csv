I also like that it had a fast hint, although it wasn't needed all that much if you took your time. My one massive complaint is who thought it was a good idea to unzoom every time you found something in a hidden object scene? These are the times that I wonder if the developers actually play the game because that is super annoying. So it's find an item, then you have to re-zoom and find your place again. Did I mention how super annoying that is? Two full Stars deducted for that blunder alone. But don't let it stop you from playing this game, it's very good.
