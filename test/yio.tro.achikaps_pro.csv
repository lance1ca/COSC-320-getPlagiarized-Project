The only thing is that sometimes the tasks make me puzzled. For example - decrease the amount of units. When they are eaten by bioreactor - it doesn't fulfill the task, when they are killed by palace - too. So how can I do it?...And I have already killed all enemies, so cannot try and make a unit be killed by opponent.. Nevertheless brilliant game that I enjoy!",5,0,1.21e,2019-10-14 04:34:35,"Thanks for good reply. This is a task in sandbox mode, so you can ignore it.

Some things I think could be improved though is that the campaign levels are very repetitive and don't really seem to increase in difficulty except for maybe a few exceptions.  There are some great and creative user made levels, maybe use some of those for the campaign?  Bombers are too OP, I'd recommend enabling the enemy to shoot them down.  Also require building/crafting airplanes, similar to drones or even houses, where you can have a total of 4 for each airport.",5,3,1.19a,2018-07-25 11:10:39,"Thanks for good reply.

This is a major flaw, since you could get half way through a level before you realize that this time you need to power your buildings, or that you need ammunition, when you didn't need those things in the previous level.  If once you learned about a system you needed to do them from then on it would be better.  Or at least could have a better visual representation of the differences. Also you absolutely need a mine, a factory, and a farm and you can't build some of those if you don't have the resources that they produce, meaning there is this strange part at the beginning of each level where you need to count all available resources to make sure you can build them or you will just run out.  It is inconsistent with the rest of the level where you can make slightly inefficient moves and be fine. Enemy difficulty spikes in a few places and feels unfair.  The helicopters can be devastating and the defenders don't redistribute to compensate automatically.  It feels unfair.",3,4,1.18h,2018-02-22 11:19:43,"Thanks for reply. Yeah, I agree it can be confusing at times. The rule is simple: if you can build ammunition then you'll need it, same with power station. But it's easy to forget about them.
