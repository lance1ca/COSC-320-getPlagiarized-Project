This ""Nexus Media Importer"" will let you copy or delete the contents of the external drive. However, it will only recognize photos, music and videos. It won't even see documents or any other non-media types of file.   This app does NOT mount the flash drive as part of the Nexus file system. It doesn't show up as storage space under system settings, and no other apps can see the contents of the flash drive. You can launch a media player of your choice by selecting a music or video file from your flash drive with this app. But no other apps can see the files by themselves. So this app does NOT, for example, mount the file system and allow you to back up any data to an external flash drive. It ONLY allows you to view, play or copy media type files.  For the moment, I can live with these limitations.  But I really wish that this app would simply mount the flash drive as a fully accessible file system.",4,0,6.4,2013-10-12 13:52:08,,

I travel quite a bit with work and have a decent sized mp4 movie collection on a 1 tb Seagate. This solved my issues of moving movies on and off of SD cards or my tablets memory. I am using this on the original WiFi Xoom as well as the Nexus 7.  Nexus 7 works great with USB drives but cannot fully support the large hard drive. The Xoom on the other hand zips right along. This is the best money that I have spent on an app. The price could be 100.00 and it would still be worth every penny as my dated hardware breathes new life as a portable media solution for hotel stays... just add an HDMI cable and its like being in your living room!

The instructions got me going, and though not perfect for what I had hoped for (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), I now have access to my 100GB+ music library on a Centron 128GB USB stick ($64 at Tiger Direct). Toss in two Kingston 64GB USB sticks ($27 ea.) with videos and I am set for long road trips, flights, or just watching a TV show on the fly. Couple of notes for the one star reviewers. Read the troubleshooter for sure. I too found certain OTG cables did not work and so I purchased the recommended Amazon cable for about $3 (shipping included).

Wow, he did it! Amazing work man.

I use this app with a QQ-Tech¬Æ Micro  USB Host Mode Cable (OTG Cable) bought from Amazon for 0.98 cents. I have tested it with the following flash drives: SanDisk Cruzer Fit 16 GB USB Flash Drive; Kingston Data Traveler G3 32gb USB Flash Drive, and about 3 off-brand flash drives and it has worked with each and every one. It did NOT work with one of the off brands at first but, the dev tweaked and updated the app and now every drive we have works.   We only use this app for movies so, that's all I can speak on. What has worked so far for us: .mp4, .mkv, and .wmv. From 1080p to 720p Handbraked to get the files down to about 1.5-2.5 GB. -------------------------------------------------Truly helpful developer, amazing app support.

However if I select DISCONNECT from app menu, the usb flash drive contents disappear and message appears ""waiting for media"" -  leaving the usb flash drive connected and  selecting SCAN again from App will re-read usb flash drive again Ok.  However I had expected that the usb flash drive could be changed by using the DISCONNECT selection from App menu, swopping flash drive and  again SCAN contents - this is not the case - nothing happens except drive details show at top of screen, but not content directory, and pressing SCAN again locks whole app.  In order to get the app working again, I have to reboot the xoom.  While the ability to read one flash drive is useful and on the XOOM better than nothing , the need to reboot completely to change a flash drive is disappointing and annoying.
