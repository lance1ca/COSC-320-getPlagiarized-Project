The 1984-esque setting is suitably creepy with its totalitarian vibe and vintage presentation. The premise is interesting and though limited manages to convey the narrative effectively and makes the game somewhat addictive.  There are a few issues I have with Blackbar though. For one, I found the play length to be too short. With this kind of premise you could easily have a chapter type design with each chapter telling a different story set in the same world, or one developing story from different character point of views. Right now the story of Vi and Kenty feels like one piece of a larger, missing puzzle.  Secondly, more to do with the gameplay itself, I found some of the puzzles to be unnecessarily hard - in particular 'Subculturia' sticks out as something that I never would have thought to guess! Challenge in a game is a good thing, but so is remembering that players don't have all the pieces of the puzzle like the developers do.  Overall, I enjoyed playing through Blackbar despite the short length and disappointing ending (underwhelming and too 'fairytale') but can't give 5 stars based on what this game could have been yet falls short of.",4,2,1.0.3,2015-02-11 06:39:15,,
