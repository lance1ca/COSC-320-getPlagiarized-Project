Or times where you want to scroll through text but are limited to scrolling at an extremely slow pace.

Every bit as good as the first one. Felt a tad short but it could just be cuz I knew how to navigate better as I had already beaten the first one. Either way I'd say it's worth the time and money.,5,1,1.2,2017-09-26 16:48:50,,

The writing is great and it really feels like you're exploring someone's phone. It's a little shorter then I'd have liked (shorter than the first I think) but wonderfully crafted.,4,1,1.2,2017-09-24 14:14:02,,

A very important, too often seen and way too ignored topic in our societies that made me look around and think twice. Beautifully designed interface and graphics, nice to see, not tiring for the eyes, easy and smooth navigation and an original soundtrack that sets the tone for the perfect atmosphere to enjoy the experience this game offers. 5*!!!",5,6,1.2,2017-09-24 12:02:19,,
