Think you need to at least add them periodically so that we can update with new ones as and when they are added. Simply wanted something like 'always' or 'forever'.... Please add soon?!

I would have rated this app higher but my gripe is that Android users gets shafted. Not only do we pay more than the Apple users, but we get less. The ipad app has a flash card feature that allows you to quiz your child and take pictures of the corresponding words. If you're in the market for this app do yourself a favor and buy the one for the ipad/iphone.  To the developers: hopefully this will reach your ears and you can add the flash card feature as an update.",3,6,1.9.2,2012-05-03 06:36:46,,
