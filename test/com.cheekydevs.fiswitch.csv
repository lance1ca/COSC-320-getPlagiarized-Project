I've used it for years and it has worked seamlessly. Since I upgraded to Android 10.0 root no longer works though . I had to go back to using the accessibility service to switch carriers. This isn't a deal breaker but being able to use root provided a better overall experience. With root enabled it just switches. Without root it opens the dialer and pastes the codes for you.
