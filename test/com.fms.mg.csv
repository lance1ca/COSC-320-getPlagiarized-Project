It took much too much trial and error to get the settings that I wanted. My biggest complaint is the way the screen scales. If you use hardware acceleration, the screen size is great but it turns otherwise pretty pixels into an ugly blurry mess. If you turn it off, you get your pixels back but the screen shrinks!
