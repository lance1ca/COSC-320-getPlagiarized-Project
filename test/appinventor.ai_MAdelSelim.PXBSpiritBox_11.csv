Only thing different is the picture. I refunded that version asap.  Really need to add in more options like VOX.  Another good option and I truly believe the Market price would go up with more buyers.  Make the app attach to the already built in radio on our phones. Tho we would require head phones to catch are local signal stations.  It will be a power app amongst all these other apps that really are useless to a point. Once options are updated. Man....  Your gonna ride this section of the app store. It would genuine and not this same loop play already implemented. For greater communication. That idea right there in an app is worth the $100 bill to pay out or more. But other then that....  This will do on a basic level.  Step up the play and make this app grow into a new Direction and potential buyers.  Don't move from it and make the same app with another background picture.,2,15,1.0,2018-02-03 08:20:08,,

A step up from the former version. You have to be quick to catch what's said and recording if possible is a good thing for play back extra confirmation. Yet you can get Real Time EVP with this!  And it's not to overloaded with sounds so you have a chance to digest.  If you want more just come out of the app leaving it live and go back in and press start again for double sound or more.  Has a nice quality clear sound to the frequencies.  It's a good app and cheap too for what it can do and you should get many results with this and quite consistently also.  There are a few vague sound words but if you wait for the energy to be allowed to build up through its systems and not jump on every word you hear and let it settle a bit you should find it works well.,4,32,1.0,2017-09-26 22:57:15,Thank you for your detailed review and sharing your professional experience and helpful ideas.
