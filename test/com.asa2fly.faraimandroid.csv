It's imperative that pilots have the latest changes from the FAA in the FAR/AIM and the lack of updates makes this app so but useless. I may as well just buy the softcover doorstop from Amazon.

I know there have been numerous updates since which I confirmed by referencing the book.    I see other users have same issue so good to know I am not the only one.   ASA needs to keep on top of this.   If they charge money for something that is a free publication really, might as well make sure you keep it up to date.
