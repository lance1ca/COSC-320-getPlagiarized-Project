Sorry to hear that. Do you have sd card? Did you allow the app to use the sd card during the installation?
When the game is installed it also downloads from google play store an external obb file with assets like sounds and backgrounds and unzips it on the sd card (physical or virtual).

Sorry to hear that. Do you have sd card? Did you allow the app to use the sd card during the installation?
When the game is installed it also downloads from google play store an external obb file with assets like sounds and backgrounds and unzips it on the sd card (physical or virtual).

Do you even understand how much time, money and hard work goes into making a game like this?  Hands down probably one of the best games I have ever played on an Android phone. People will look back at this game as the start of something entirely new in point and click games. The fact that you can play the game again and make different choices that will affect the outcome of the game.... Brilliantly Done!!!  Update 8-9-17.  For those of you complaining about what they said about suicide...  You have know idea what the devs have been through.  They may have lost someone close to them from suicide. I agree, it's a selfish act. It's also a serious problem now. The more people are aware, the better they are to see the signs in someone. If you didn't like that comment,  then move on and grow up and don't bash the devs for it.  Thank you again for such an amazing game. I have played it over 10 times now",5,76,1.1.0,2017-08-09 15:52:09,,

Nexus 6 (phone) Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 (tablet) and Dell Venue 8 7040 (tablet).   On the Nexus 6 it is buttery smooth, but too hard to see the object that you need to interact with. On the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 the game looks fine at first, but almost immediately after starting it I get graphical artifacts all across the screen. Only game I have ever seen this happen on any android device ever (having owned about 10+). As for the Dell Venue 7040 tablet, the game won't run, the cpu gets 80k in the latest AnTuTu, but because the game isn't properly optimized, it barely runs. Like the animations on the start menu won't run.   Overall, I want to like this game, but now it just feels like I wasted $5 on a game that the devs don't care to update for modern devices.   On a side note, I'm running the Android N beta program on my phone, 5.1 on my Dell and 6.0 on my Samsung, this is clearly an issue with optimization and could be fixed with an update.
