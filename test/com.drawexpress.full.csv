I even attempted to export them as a safety measure but didn't verify that the file was indeed exported... it wasn't.

Easy to get to grips with, have tried many similar apps and while some are prettier end result (curved lines on mind maps etc) this is by far the most versatile and natural to use for me with a stylus. Bought after a day of using the lite version. As always a couple of features would be nice, but I understand what it takes to impliment changes: Fully integrate with google drive? Add images from gallery/folder? Change border and text colour (would also allow for text on its own - clear border) also change shape option at later date without redrawing?
