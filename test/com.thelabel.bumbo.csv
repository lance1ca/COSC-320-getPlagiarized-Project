Haven't played it on PC, but have been looking forward to playing this since release. Biggest issue is the fact that there is no automated save feature for your progress through a run. If you close the app mid-run, or maybe it crashes on you, you lose all progress and you have to start over, so thats kind of annoying. If this can get fixed it'll be a big improvement.
