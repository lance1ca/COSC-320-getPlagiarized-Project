we are currently investigating AA issues on Snapdragon devices. In the mean-time, it is best to turn AA off to increase performance on those devices.

This is a very early review, I will update it in the future. When I first purchased the game, I had doubts on the controls. When I logged on I noticed that the experience is much greater than I anticipated. My device is able to run all settings on high meaning that your experience may vary. The controls are well suited for this type of game. I so far recommend it if you have 10$ lying around.",5,6,,2021-01-21 01:38:07,,
