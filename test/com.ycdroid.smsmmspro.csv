I could not figure out why some texts were missing and these were the ones i had to have. It turns out that these long texts were MMS and they are not included in the conversation. I also do not see all my threads: What is up with that?,1,8,1.5,2014-02-04 14:09:00,,

I'm not tech savvy at all so I needed something very simple to use.  This app is great, I love it:) First I downloaded the one day trial version, but within 20   minutes I upgraded to the full version! Soooo worth the $1.70:)",5,0,1.5,2014-02-02 05:04:49,,

The incoming text messages show the correct time sent to my phone, but when it shows up on the email where I sent the stream of text, the time shows completely differently. Not useful for documenting for court purposes. Does not grab the MMS messages and keep them in the text stream. I had to choose each one individually and send it to my email, but then it doesn't show the phone number, date and time where the text came from. Again, for documenting harassment, this doesn't help me in court.",2,3,1.4,2012-11-24 15:16:23,,
