I spent the money to purchase the app so that he would have access to educational apps on my phone and his tablet. I want him to spend time learning instead of just playing games. This app accomplishes both of my missions: to keep him busy and learning. It is great for keeping him occupied at the doctors office too.,5,17,1.0.3,2015-10-13 14:12:33,,

The app picuters are misleading, I thought I was getting letters too. I paid $2.99 to get 1-10 which is garbage.
