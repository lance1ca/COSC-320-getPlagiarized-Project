Even without that this is a great app.,5,1,2.0,2021-01-26 15:44:51,Thats a great idea! I'll look into adding it. Thank you for the review :),2021-01-26 15:46:22

But never had i seen an app that did ALL that in one. This is a well made, designed snd intuitive app. I opened it and felt it was easy to navigate, understand. I loved everything it had. Literally made me delete a few others i had cause this gave me the info better. I even plan to spread the word so others can use it as well and know of it. Curious if its on ios though.",5,1,1.0,2020-08-31 11:08:47,Thank you very much!,2020-08-31 11:31:47

There is literally no reason to spend the dollar in this app.,3,1,1.0,2020-08-24 19:23:23,,
