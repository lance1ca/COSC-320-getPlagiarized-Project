Whats meant to be scary comes across as extremely narmy. At a certain point, some puzzles become more of a chore than a game, in particular towards the end of the game where either the logic of puzzles aren't apparent (i.e. the floor puzzle) or the puzzles just take too long (i.e. block puzzle). A few puzzles in particular, the microscope ""puzzle"" (a player vs ai game where ai is at a difficulty youre computer is capable of, so on a mobile its basically impossible) and the piano puzzle (a 12 round simon says that starts you from the beginning if you miss) are especially problematic, as they are essentially rage games in whats otherwise a decent puzzle game. The only saving grace for these is that nearly all puzzles are essentially skippable, but that also somewhat defeats the purpose of having them to begin with.  All in all, I'd say it shows its age, and would probably do better as a full on remake.

Unlock puzzles to gain access to other rooms. Still fun to play...didn't complete it the first time so here I go again! They also did a second game...maybe this is on the cards too. WARNING! The game does take up a lot of memory (0.95 GB and 0.8 GB to save the game)! So an SD card is a necessity unless you don't play other games. Very nostalgic for me and graphics sometimes show their age but still enjoyable. If you like horror and puzzles...play at night!,4,39,1.0.1.2,2016-10-29 03:38:52,,

It's definitely a product of its time, more like a budget movie interrupted by increasingly frustrating puzzles. Moving through the house becomes tedious; wish the map would allow jumping between rooms. The storyline is nearly impossible to follow because the game triggers video scenes after completing puzzles, rather than in a linear fashion. I had to read the included novella to clarify exactly what was going on. The extras in this anniversary edition are a great feature, especially the novel, original game script, and documentary video. Had to knock off a couple of stars for the buggy save feature. I left the game alone for about a week & returned to find all my save slots defaulting to the beginning of the game. Game error, or further punishment from Henry Stauf? Methinks the latter since I have to do the **** crypt puzzle again!

The animations look dated, the sound in the ""movies"" is by no means synchronized with the images, and the interface is really hard to use on my phone. Some of the puzzles were totally impossible; for example the piano puzzle; the first 11 notes go fine, but 12 is so far to the right that the game constantly thinks I want to leave the puzzle. I tried lots of times, and sometimes succeed in getting a bit further but always was kicked out of the game before finishing. Sigh...  In the end I had to skip 2 of the puzzles by using the hint book in the library. I finished the game, but it left me feeling a bit disappointed; this game was better in my memory.
