The levels are all fun to play. My 8 year old son loved playing this game too. It gives a good foundation for cause and effect, physics, and programming too (there's no programming in the game, but puzzle solving with mechanical parts and iterating solutions is the same process as one follows when solving programming challenges with functions).",5,2,1.5.3,2020-08-02 15:11:13,,

Would have been better if it wasn't compared so much to The Incredible Machine - I searched for that and got this, but there's really no similarity. You only have a couple types of objects to move around, so the question is always just where do you put the item, never any question of how to solve the puzzle. I got bored quickly and I'm not sure if it's because I was expecting something more like TIM or if I just found the game itself boring.",3,10,1.5.3,2020-06-07 13:36:09,,

It's a modern day version of The Incredible Machine, for those old enough to remember that game. When you get stuck you can ask for help but you only get so many free requests before you have to start buying them.
