I need an app that I can make my own routine, I already have a routine laid out by a trainer and it works for me. I do add new exercises as time goes on so it also needs to be editable. FitProSport FULL does have these qualities and that was one reason I looked into it. I like the interface fine, but it does have a major drawback for me. Not enough gym exercises, machine ones especially. There are some, and I understand there are probably thousands of variations on exercises and space is limited. While this has a fair amount of free weight exercises for the shoulders, it is quite limited on pulley exercises, it has some just not many. The pulley system is much easier for my shoulders and for me less skipping around. Now I have not gotten into programming my routine past this spot but I can guess it is going to be similar in other areas. I am not saying it is not worth it, but it is limited and would like more exercises. Maybe a database we can look at and download individual exercises.",4,19,4.63,2017-09-09 06:43:55,"New exercises will be added!

This app adds time in between sets of editing fields and saving. There are multiple ways to move to your next set but only one saves. I bought this to enter my own workout which takes as much time as the workout. Then you stuggle with how the app expects you to input data vs how you expect it to. There's a steep learning curve to make this a seemless part of your workout. I'd rather not reinvent the wheel...paper is king.,2,5,2.36,2016-09-25 11:54:46,You can add the results during the rest between exercises. It'll take a little time. Write on e-mail your wishes.
