them, and you have to spend turns to find them, and finally finish off the

I get so attached to the characters and want to make sure that I do my best to protect them and grow with them. I even downloaded additional characters but can not play with them in mid game of starting with my original characters. Maybe there should be a clever way to introduce these characters into the game if you desire. Maybe when a character gets killed and you advance to a safe spot that allows you to introduce a new character to your team and then you continue on.

Their approach to in-app purchases tends to be one-off-not-major-revenue-driver--similar to a DLC or minor expansion set style purchase, rather than the constant-buy approach seen in some other developers (DungeonKeeper comes to mind).  They also tend to actively maintain their game, with regular releases of bug fixes, minor content addition, balance tweaks, and so forth.  Dialog and plot tends to be well above average for a mobile game and comparable to a solid-but-not-fantastic PC game--similar to, say, the writing in the old SSI gold box games, or the mid/late 1990's FF games (Final Fantasy IV, V, or VI), or a mid-quality AD&D 2nd edition adventure.
