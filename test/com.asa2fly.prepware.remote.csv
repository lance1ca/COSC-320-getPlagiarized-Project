But the chart section seems to be functionally useless. It asks you what the class airspace is around a given airport, and refers you to the chart. The thing is, you need to the key to figure out what type of airspace the squiggly lines represent, and they don't show the key!    When you hit the explanation it says its ""Class D"" or ""Class C"" and cites the key.  But again, the key is not actually provided, so it really does no good.
