RIP removes the boring and mundane nature of normal task planners and gamifies it to appeal to those of use who need a little zest in their lives. Normally boring things like cleaning, working out, and drinking water can be gamified through RIP and made into a sort of self competition where you will be able to track your statistics of completion and be inclined to continue in order to not fall behind. Overall, RIP is a unique concept made into a simple and easy to use app.",5,4,,2021-01-04 21:36:06,,
