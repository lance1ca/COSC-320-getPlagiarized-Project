The free BBC apps are generally quite good, but this one is really poorly made and there isn't much to it. You progress and get a star whether you get the answers right or not so my kids just tap the first thing they see to get to the next clip. It took my 5 year about 45 mins to get through most of the game getting most answers correct. It took my toddler about 2 mins to get through two levels of the matching game without getting a single answer correct. Both bored with it now.",1,69,01.01.00,2020-05-15 05:57:04,"Hello Tom, thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear that you children did not enjoy the game. If they found it too easy, may we suggest repeat playing, as it is an excellent way of strengthening the learning they have completed within the app. Thank you again!",2020-08-23 13:08:29
