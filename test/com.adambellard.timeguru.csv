I was looking for something with the training element, and this does that beautifully. I'm also delighted that you can easily combine measures of different lengths.

I was puzzled that people are griping about not being able to change the sound of that 1st beat in a measure. I wonder if they're just selecting ""1"" as the meter? Logically, that gives no accent. If you pick any number higher than ""1"", then the first beat is noticeably different. Admittedly some sounds may have a less obvious ""one"", but it's there.
