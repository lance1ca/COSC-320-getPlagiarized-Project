It worked very well. But I wasn't liking the ads. So, I paid for the ad-free version. Nothing but bugs. Scrolling down the first selection screen always goes to the animated background but nothing on the screen to select. If I jus select something from the top of the first screen it will start but as soon as I tap the correct character the ap crashes. Waste of time and money.",1,12,,2019-01-19 22:28:17,,
