a rpg that affordable looks great in my opinion has good story development

its hard to keep up with many planets at once for i start getting 
overpopulated fast later in the game. The pirate one is also fun i enjoy 
staying in the starting zone as a merchant as i fill my coffers and rep

functionality. For instance: turn skipping (set mvt to 0) for individual 
units; being able to just see units with no current orders; saving 
list-filter preferences between instances of loading the unit list; the end 
turn button changing color or something when there's no key outstanding 
actions to be taken; some sort of guard/sentry mode; a heal/refuel mode; an 
""upgrade all"" button... It just makes certain routine actions unnecessarily 
tedious. Add that ui functionality and I'd give it 6 stars =) One idea to

Overpopulation is extremely bad (obviously, as is real life overpopulation) but it occurs too easily due to the fact that hab units can only go up to 8 or so levels, meaning that say you have an 8 quality system well you will most likely need half of those spent on hab units, leaving only 4 quality remaining, and the terramforming reactor only allows for 2 or so more quality, forcing the overpopulation status onto many low-quality stars. Though thats just my opinion or course. Also, I wish there would be some kind of battleships, maybe as a late game fighting vessle since they would be extremely powerful but cost a lot in terms of upkeep and initial industry cost. It would be great if these two things were fixed/added but of course this is just my opinion, nonetheless this is still an aamzing game which has done a lot of things right compared to other 4x games",5,0,2.6.29,2018-02-10 04:06:12,,

The faction interactions are a little simplistic in my opinion, and the relatively minimalistic combat sometimes leaves the game feeling like it lacks focus on a specific element. However, resource management is where this game shines. Expanding colonies, supporting old worlds, and funding a war effort all take precise planning, and a few minor errors could send your empire spiraling to bankruptcy.

Take control of a splinter group of explorers as they survive a catastrophe/migration event and find them selves needing to explore/expand a new home of star systems.  Aliens are less keen to accomodate their new neighbors, and prepare to attack while you settle, explore, research tech/weapons, and hopefully keep them at bay until you are strong enough to eliminate the alien threat(s).

They return to gaming origins and make essential tweaks to established formats. This game is complex where it needs to be, and simplifies less important areas. For instance, research leads to a complex set of choices that have varied effects on your empire, while trade agreements and political treatises are handled by a touch of a button. Also, your 4X competitor, the xenos, is a non-negotiable enemy, so that you know you have to build a fleet at some point in the game. You can design your own ships using the many reactors, weapons and training options that are all made available by your research tactics. This game is very addictive and fun to play.
