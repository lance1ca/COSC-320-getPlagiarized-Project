this game is excellent. Exactly what I was hoping for. The steering 
sensitivity using the buttons took a few runs to adjust to as it felt a 
little too slow at first but having adjusted I can now throw the car down 
the course at speed which is incredibly satisfying. My only complaint is 
that the control settings seem limited. As I mentioned before a sensitivity 
option for the button layouts like the one for tilt controls would be 
great. My main issue though is that the layouts for manual transmission are 
very difficult to use for me. Placing a shift button between the gas and 
brake makes tapping the brake and gas back and forth quickly very hard. 
This is made worse by using arrows for both gas and brake and for shifting. 
Changing the gas and brake from arrows to pedal shapes would remove a lot 
of confusion. My suggestion for a better manual transmission button layout 
would be to take the automatic transmission button layout 3, change the gas 
and brake arrows to pedals, then place the upshift arrow above the gas and 
the downshift arrow above the brake. The handbrake could be placed above 
the shift arrows or to the left of the brake pedal and still be within easy 
reach. Also, the tiny tachometer and gear indicator in the top right of the 
hud is difficult to see and is far away from where you need to be looking 
to drive. Even though this game is not very manual shifting friendly, I 
highly recommend it as the graphical quality, good physics, and 
replayability make the $1.50 price a steal.",5,0,1.119,2018-06-30 15:46:06,Thanks! All of this is in the list!,2018-07-01 09:55:16

neglection about the game, like i wish you could purchase cars instead of 
winning them after competing in a competition. Also for there to be mud 
splashing on the windshield, a button for the wipers and such, perhaps an 
interactive dashboard, just an idea. Overall, I have fun playing and cant 
wait to get over to some more locations, try out the other cars. I would 
recommend this game to anyone who has a feeling for cars, and rallying.",5,1,1.119,2018-06-17 15:45:40,"Thanks :) Personally I think Canada is the best set of tracks, but they are the last you will get to!

adding a dynamic birds eye view camera in the race, like in the one you

Quite surprised when I got this! Though there are 3 bugs I found: two that are annoying, and one that's really silly.  When locking and unlocking my phone when still in the game, the resolution changes to the lowest setting, but the option still appears to be set to 720p. I have to set it to 360p, then back to 720p.  High shadows don't work well: they cause lots of flickering on the car.  If the frame rate is low, around 20fps, when you reverse, the car starts to go into super speed past the normal limit! The lower the frame rate, the quicker the bug starts. I laughed hard when I found this bug!  Other than that, I love this game.",5,21,1.119,2018-02-26 06:16:34,"Perfect!

The physics are more advanced than you would expect for a mobile game, however all the stock tunes lean towards understeer. It's rare to have a wild moment in the two cars I drove (lancia delta and Ford RS).  Overall I think the game plays quite well, I was happy with the controls, I was happy with the feel of the cars, damage is realistic and unforgiving.  Automatic gearbox is capable which is rare in a mobile game.  Overall I think i echo the sentiment that this sort of plays like an oldschool rally game, almost like Rally sport Challenge on the original xbox.  Definitely worth a couple of bucks, you'd be silly not to buy it if you want some fun on your phone.

A couple times the game has just crashed randomly even though I am using the recommended graphics settings for my device (everything high, shadows and mirror reflections medium, no anti-aliasing, phone is a Moto Z Play). Another bug i found is when I turn off my phone while racing then turn it back on, a ad will appear for roughly two seconds before I can resume. A bit annoying since I have paid for this app. One other major bug I found is whenever I change the tuning of my car then start a race, the vehicle will get stuck in first gear and I'll have to restart the race. My other issue with the game is the sound design. I would love to have each vehicle have it's own unique sound like its real life counter part. For example, the Subaru should sound like a flat 4 Subaru. The Mitsubishi Evo should sound like an Evo, and so on. I could even help source out individual sounds to help you guys. I would also love to see each vehicle have it's own name, like how Rockstar names their vehicles in GTA. Or BeamNG with their vehicle naming scheme. Another feature I'd like to see is a bit better vehicle damage map. I'm not asking for extreme soft body physics, but something like body panels falling off or something. Those are really my only gripes, besides those you guys have done fantastic with this game.",3,0,1.118,2018-02-06 14:40:20,,

Although some things could be improved. The tilt steering feels a little odd, i used the cockpit cam and noticed the wheel wasn't rotating smoothly and caused me to lose control of the car quite easily (i changed the tilt sensitivity), but that is probably a lack of experience on my part. Another thing (minor) was that i couldn't position the buttons (controls) where i wanted to. For example i am using tilt steering the brake button is on the left and so is the handbrake, but it would be more comfortable if the handbrake was on the right while the brake staying on the left, but that's only minor.

I feel like the tier system is rather pointless right now due to this.  Secondly, there are no cars to be unlocked via time trials or multiplayer racing, which has unfortunately made these mods rather dead or not worth playing all that much.  Thirdly, there are no slider controls or a steering wheel control method, Just buttons. Fourthly, everytime you take the game out of immersive mode or change app,  it decides to rebuild shaders, which takes time.

The physics are one of the best I've seen on mobile, it's actually mind boggling how they were able to get this so right! The sound is good overall but I think the co driver's voice could use some polish. The visuals are serviceable, so lower your expectations if you're a graphics driven gamer. I think the asset variety is pretty slim and not having licences for cars and sponsors takes away a little authenticity. The lightning during rain and motion blur is just superb. The use of the right country flags on fences and road side decals is a very nice touch. There's no superlatives to describe how much I liked the courses! And just how are they able to fit this game in such a small download? It's seems like magic and it's impressive!  Don't let the negatives hold you back from experiencing this game as it's totally unique with amazing physics, impeccable courses to drive on and a ton of respect for the player's intelligence. While the shortcomings can be attributed to a small budget, the Devs talent shines through with all the things it does correctly.

There is no IAP. No flashy banners to push 'content updates'. No 'ultra premium cars'. No unnecessarily convoluted upgrade systems. No timers. It's just you, iconic rally cars, and good-looking routes. I'm not an avid rally fan myself, but I could vouch that cars behave the way they should (at least according to their IRL counterparts' drivetrains). Ultimately, the physics feels just right. It's not Asphalt, of course - and neither it's dauntingly realistic.  The races itself are rather short, and you can take breaks between stages - which means one could play this game while commuting. Or in long bursts, really, since there's no silly timer stopping you from doing so.  While it's obvious that much passion and heart is poured into this racer, I can't help but to think that this title could use some more polish, and that it could definitely benefit from a more coherent artstyle. As it stands, the atmosphere is a bit generic. But then again the gameplay is just good enough that I could overlook those small flaws.  Bottom line, this game is the antithesis of freemium racers.
