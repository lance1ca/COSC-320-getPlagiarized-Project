It has a pretty slick set of synthesizers and effects, clearly aimed toward ""chiptune"" style music generation. There are also quite a few digital samples, more than enough for basic composition tasks.   I was concerned because the screenshots make the screen look pretty cluttered, but you can resize or move most of the elements with no trouble, so I had no problem composing a simple video game soundtrack on my first use of the program.  My only complaint is with some basic UI elements: In the note strip at the top of the screen, moving your finger up moves the items on the screen down, exactly the opposite of what you'd expect. Likewise, the file picker doesn't finger-scroll like other Android/iOS touch apps. (Instead, it has a classic scroll bar on the right. Kind of anti-pattern, IMO.) You also can't scrub in the timeline, but these are minor quirks.  Aside from the UI quirks, this is a fun and easy program to compose on, and with something like Google Drive or Dropbox, you can wirelessly sync files between your phone (or tablet) and a PC.

The entry point into understanding and fully utilizing this robust application still perplexes me to the point of frustration.  Maybe I just haven't given this app a fair shot and sat down long enough to understand how it works.  But on the other side of that confusing coin, I have read through the tutorial and watched the how-to videos (though, I find those in particular to be extremely lacking and not intuitive at all), and I still come away with being stumped as it pertains to being comfortable with this application.  I realize that some of the best and most powerful tools require a lot of study and have a large learning curve.  But this app, to me, is just overly complicated, when I don't believe it needs to be this way to be a great app.",4,1,1.7.3c,2013-05-15 12:13:08,,

This app moves past both these issues. I've played around with this tracket a bit on the computer and was pleasently surprised how well the interface was adapted to be tablet friendly without changing too much. I can easily resize all portions of the screen to fit what I need in view.(though the bottom is hard to get on my phone...but perfect on my tablet.) I can't decide if there's a noticeable latency, which means I doubt it will get in your way. Handles everything so far like a champ! Now if only I could make use of my tablet's usb port for my korg nanokey.",5,4,1.6.5,2012-01-15 20:30:39,,
