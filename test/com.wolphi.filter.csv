If it does I haven't heard a noticeable difference. Still this can cut out a lot of the noise which makes it useful for older radios that lack any kind of filtering. Currently doesn't work correctly on my EVO Shift, but works great on my old G1. 4 stars if it starts working right on the Shift or adds QRN filtering. 5 for both.",3,2,1.24,2011-08-01 10:43:39,,
