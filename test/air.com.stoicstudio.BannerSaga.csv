I should have done so sooner. Pretty great turn based strategy RPG. Artwork is beautiful. Excellent creativity in how the world is developed. I only have two complaints. The story is a bit difficult to follow in the begining. The descriptive text in towns and battle are difficult to read most of the time. You have to get pretty close to the screen.

The battle mechanic was really frustrating. Because of the way the turns work you end up being punished by finishing off mooks. I think the ideal strategy is to bring them low, then ignore them so they plink at your guys which wastes the enemy turn and gives your guys more chances to hit the bigger bad guys. This feels really counterintuitive and is honestly not very much fun. The story seemed cool, but with so much loading it was hard to get into it without being interrupted. The visuals were pretty great though. I guess I'm mostly disappointed that I finally decided to jump into paid games, heard this one was good, decided to drop the $10 on it, and it was such a disappointment. Maybe freemium is the way to go...

I would much rather there be more awesome $10 games in the app store than the hundreds of $1 bejeweled clones. The Banner Saga is an amazing game... when it works.  It would appear that the window Versus Evil added for Google Play integration causes the screen to refresh improperly. Whenever I suspend/resume the phone or disconnect/reconnect from the internet the game comes up fine for a second, then the ""Connected to Google Play"" window pops up, then the screen appears to turn landscape then portrait orientation and the screen refreshes to black. The problem is that only some of the game is redrawn after that. I lose the background, the movement range squares, and some of the characters and it makes the game unplayable.   If I manage to play an entire level without turning off the device (or having it turn off for inactivity) or disconnecting from the internet then it works fine. I wouldn't mind the refresh problems if reloading was faster, but it is rather long. I also wouldn't mind the long load times if suspend/resume worked properly, but it doesn't.   FYI, I am using a Galaxy Note 3 with Android 5.0",3,0,1.5.16,2017-09-22 15:21:48,"Hi Nathan, we appreciate the time you took to let us know you had this issue.

It has so much potential that it left me begging to learn more. Fourth, the gameplay is straightforward to learn but still quite challenging. I had to play it through twice before I could beat it without turning down the difficulty. But I didn't mind, since there are so many different ways it can play out that it was fun to see how different choices affected my caravans.

Although some choices presented don't really give a way as to what is the outcome going to be (as not to include any spoilers, I will not mention specifics), it is really nice game. Some may see it as a charm of the game - not knowing what will happen, for me though - it was a bit frustrating at times. The tactics (battles) are really fun.

Combat can be almost as frustrating as making the wrong decision in dialogue and getting some kids head stoved in. A lot of thinking and more than its fair share of luck is needed.  The only major issue I have had is with the audio.   From what I can tell The Banner Saga is an enormous memory hog and kicks up a fuss if anything is sharing the system memory.

The graphics are pleasant to look at, and the gameplay has just the right mix of depth and complexity along with simple fun and addictiveness. I am constantly tweaking my strategy. One particularly nice feature is the ability to change the game's difficulty at any time, allowing me to have a bit simpler play when I just want to relax (or if a particular battle is too challenging), and more complex play when I really want to dig in and challenge myself. I will probably play this game through multiple times to see the various story paths play out. Way to go, devs!

I've often read about its tactical combat being like Final Fantasy Tactics.  In the sense that it's turn based, I'll grant you that.  But the combat here also has several elements to it that are unlike any I've seen before and they add a ton of strategic depth.  The entire game is this way: mechanics that feel maybe 1/4 familiar, and 3/4 unique to this game alone.  End result: a giant new, beautiful but dangerous world that begs to be explored to the fullest.  BUY IT!",5,1,1.1.14,2014-11-21 00:57:25,,
