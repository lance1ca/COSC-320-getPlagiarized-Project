No, when I looked at a film, my pinned triggers were kind of scattered amongst the full list of triggers. I uninstalled the app because the main thing I wanted to find warnings for (brain tumors) is not an available option at this time, but if you ever add that I would absolutely redownload, even with the other issue I was having.",3,3,1.4.4,2020-10-26 14:41:29,"All of your pinned triggers should always be at the top of any movie. Is that not happening for you?

We're working on improving the requests system. When we designed it we were not expecting there to be over 800 requests. Were trying to figure out a way to balance all the requests while also not cluttering up the movie yes/no screens.",2020-10-26 14:35:42

Just one thing I would change - there is the option to hide spoilers until you press a button (i.e. character deaths), but I can't see a way to hide everything. Apart from that, I love this app. Thank you, I'm very grateful for you making it!",5,10,1.4.3,2020-10-12 06:29:28,,
