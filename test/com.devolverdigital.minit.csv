It has this sense of planning; you have to be meticulous and think ahead to do things within the time limit. The time limit makes the small world feel bigger and very quickly yours. The game manages to deliver a message through its plot but also through its main mechanic which shows videogames can be a form of art. Not everyone will enjoy it but it is a very special game indeed!,5,6,1.0.5,2021-01-12 00:45:16,,

Especially when it comes from Devolver Digital. The only downsides to this one are the touchscreen controls aren't terribly precise (naturally) and the black & white graphics aren't best for showing what something is or what needs to be done in a time-sensitive game as this. Still, great to play in short bursts. Hope to see more from Devolver on mobile!",5,199,1.0.0,2019-06-30 01:15:53,,

Only two things I wish was different: keep the screen on, it went off for me while listening to the old dude at the lighthouse and I wish I could switch the analog stick for dpad, kinda hard to make precision moves when you have to swipe to move. Other than that, feels like at home on my phone!",4,51,1.0.0,2019-06-27 04:58:39,,
