SoundAbout Pro is just an unlock key. Not an app. You would normally download and install SoundAbout. Then purchase this to unlock the Pro version. However is seems SoundAbout is no longer available for download. It has been removed from the store. Not sure why they would still leave this up for purchase. Feels like they are just trying to trick people into buying a dead program that can no longer be used. The program was last updated in 2016. Doubt it supports Android 8 and up!,1,653,,2020-03-04 10:38:22,,

Suddenly, my phone kept dropping the BT connection (earpiece or car) whenever placing or accepting a call.  The BT would always be connected, then dropped when dialing out or accepting a call, totally backwards.  I tried some APPs which were supposed to connect BT on demand to no avail.  SoundAbout solved the problem by allowing me to direct where the audio should go for the earpiece (Bluetooth Mono Dynamic, in this case for calls and streaming WinAmp to the Earpiece while bicycle riding) and for the car (A2DP for calls and streaming music to the car's audio system via BT)....now If I can just figure out why the car's audio system is not reading my music library over BT as it was a week ago.....",5,0,1.2.0,2015-04-25 16:07:49,,

I could only put my phone on vibrate and listen with my ear to the phone. XPRT has a problem at the bottom of the phone below the space bar where it loses pressure and audio goes out. Some people fix by just squeezing the bottom- but that didn't work for me when I tried it. I wrote to Mr. Woods about my problem and he worked with me to get just the right version of THIS app and for the first time in days I immediately heard audio!!!! It stopped after a couple seconds so my next instinct was also to squeeze the bottom again and it worked!!! So I opened the back and rolled a very small piece of paper into the spot at the very bottom where you stick something in to jimmy the phone open. The two things together- the app + pressure worked. I have ALL my sound back 100%. Thank you Mr Woods!!! :D Very happy camper!",5,1,,2012-10-10 08:08:24,,

This is one of them.   Here is why - it actually fixes a problem with my Samsung S3 that makes the phone near useless. For some reason the phone decides to change audio call routing randomly - and most of the time the call audio just disappears.  So while some apps are nice to have - music players, cameras, etc - all of them provide some nice but really not essential function or duplicate an existing one. This app, however, is the ONLY one out there that I am aware of that can fix this problem. Without it my phone is as good as dead.  Shame on Samsung - and much thanks to David for doing this fix.",5,1,1.0.7,2012-09-27 19:11:45,,
