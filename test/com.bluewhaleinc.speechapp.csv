First, seeing a ðŸ‘„ forming 
and saying the word would be outstanding. Second, younger children with 
learning issues do not understand the ALL CAPS. Like we adults would like 
to think they would. Words and sentences are not written that way and it's 
quite confusing. all lower case makes much more sense, ðŸ˜Š. Third, and what 
would finally make this app worth it's weight in gold is if it had a ""MY 
SPECIALS"" or ""SAVE"" tab. Where specific cards could go, no matter what 
sound they were, to work on later. I have looked through so many apps and I 
can't find any that fit. My youngest works a little here and there bouncing 
around. It's frustrating.",4,1,1.3,2018-05-30 21:57:03,,

The level 7 and 8 buttons are also cut off, to the extent that they are almost unusable. This ia a wonderful app with partial words and illustrations of complete words. This app was just what we needed for home speech practice. It is best used when I can sit with my child and give my complete attention to pronunciation and correction. More illustrated words would be a great addition to this app. Thank you for the option of turning the voice over off.",4,0,1.1,2014-09-26 13:49:06,,
