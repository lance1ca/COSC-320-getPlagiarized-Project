The good:    * Does a really nice job of simulating an analog synth, producing some really cool sounds and fairly easily imitating acoustic instruments.   * One 16-note sequencer with which you can record 12 patterns of notes.    The bad:   * No instructions except for the brief example video on the devoxxxide Youtube page. And seeing as that was published on Dec. 2013, it seems pretty unlikely there will ever be any instructions.   * The sequencer only plays whatever sound you have programmed at the time and it cannot play more than 1 of the 12 note-patterns at a time, so you can only have sound A playing on the sequencer while you play sound A on the keyboard.   * The keyboard cannot be expanded to any reasonable size, so it's not very playable.

Keep in mind I am using this for mobile sketches ~20-30 min a session so I don't need a full on groove box or maximum parameters.The closest I came was heat synth but I lost interest because it was actually too many parameters and took too much page flipping to get something I liked. This synth is the whole package for quickly tweaking out an analog sound and loading it with all the right effects. The sleek, minimal look makes it all the easier to use and fit more on the screen and the midi implementation means it can sync right back into my DAW with the 16 different sequences.   The only suggestion I would have is to add some double-tap or long press interactions with the pitch to reset it to 0 and add a sync to the LFO.
