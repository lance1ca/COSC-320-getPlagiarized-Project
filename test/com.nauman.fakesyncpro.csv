What a glitch. What do you mean by overlap times?",1,0,1.4.5,2021-02-08 04:00:29,If you pick a walk time of 40 minutes it will start they walk 40 mins ago and end it at the current time. So if you wanted to start another 40min walk then you should wait atleast 50min from the last walk,2021-02-09 11:15:06
