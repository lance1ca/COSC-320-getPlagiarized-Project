A bit laggy.",4,1,1.5.0,2020-01-06 23:20:23,"I've tried many things to get this working properly on Redmi 6, but sadly the chipset is not up to the requirements of the game. Its something to do with the audio being decompressed on the main thread on this device.  I can only suggest that you get a refund.",2020-01-17 09:15:00

Console quality graphics and fun. The only thing I wish it had was a quick race option. :3,5,3,1.5.0,2019-12-22 12:02:17,"Thanks for the feedback...maybe we can introduce a Random race feature.
