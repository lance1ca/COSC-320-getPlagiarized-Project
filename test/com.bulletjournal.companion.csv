Both have their benefits. I've come to realise that it's not an either-or question, but both are necessary. This app helps to bridge the two worlds without trying to do too much. That is one of its key distinctions. The somewhat minimalist nature of this app is a feature, not a bug. Non-bujo practitioners will not understand this app and think that it's ""useless."" As its name says, it is a *companion* to your bullet journal, and if you are a bullet journal user, you will probably find it handy. It is also powerful. Using the Library feature, you can have a digital record of all the key entries in all your bujos. If you're particularly obsessive, you could even have a photographic record of all your bullet journal pages. I'm grateful that this app came out while I was on my first volume, so I can imagine that I'll be having a great paper-digital hybrid record of my journals from here on to the end of days. The only reason I didn't give this app a full 5 stars is because it doesn't allow overlapping of dates for volumes. For example, my first volume ended in the midst of April, so by right Vol 1 should end in Apr and Vol 2 should start in May. The app forces Vol 2 to start in May. This is clearly a design mistake. Other than that, I'm loving this app and bujo, and I expect that little bugs like that mentioned above will be ironed out in time.",4,37,2.0.3,2020-04-23 02:59:18,,

The entire app is essentially just content freely available on the website, plus a temporary rapid log that expires entries after 72 hours. NOT worth the money unless you have free google play credit lying around like I did. The Reflection function is a great idea but again not worth paying for, its just two alarms per day, you can set the times but the interface could be a lot better, and the scheduling should be freer - one a day would suit me better",2,150,1.0,2019-01-08 23:36:08,,

I get that the creator probably wants to keep a minimalist approach, but if I'm to pay for an app, I'd expect more features from it than a few links I can find in my phone's browser, and a reminder function.  My main problem with the app is that there is no way to sync your notes to different devices. I have a personal phone, a work phone, a tablet, and a chromebook that runs android apps -- and I am NOT going to check every device at the end of the day to make sure I didn't miss any notes.  Please, please, please support multi-device sync!  I would also love if this had a habit tracker feature. I love habit trackers, but I do not like the tedium of making them every month. I think it would compliment the bullet journal beautifully.  Overall I think it's a good idea because I love bullet journaling and sometimes the method can use some digital help, but I think it still needs further development.",3,39,1.0,2019-01-06 00:25:41,,

Some of the Log functionality is intuitive and clever (shifting a task to note, pushed, or completed) and it some functions are missing (correcting a push to a task if it was mistakenly updated rather than deleting and reentering). --- It seems like aspects are not yet implemented (KB and Newsletter links go to the website rather than being integrated in the app).

definitely helped keep me on track with the daily reflection. Very small 
nitpick but the area where you set your two times for reflections does not 
let me set a time for around the midnight-1am hours. I was able to work 
around it by setting my evening hour as the morning one. Maybe allow both 
times to choose from a 24 hour time window? I was also looking for the

It perfectly complements the  whole experience.  The app reminds you of the Reflection time which is when you take the time to review your journal usually in the morning and at night.   To me that's a really useful feature because I used to constantly forget to do it daily.  The log is the best feature in my opinion.  I don't work in an office or a place where I can have access to my journal throughout the day except on my breaks.  This helps immensely  because now I don't have to worry about writing it somewhere else and forgetting.  Unfortunately it doesn't have a way to prevent me from losing it.  (I already lost one :( )  So until they create a notebook with an NFC tag on the cover that will pair with your phone using BLE  that notifies you when you stray too far from it. *Hint*   I'll take the next best thing; a system and an app that will help organize your life in a way that's efficient, intuitive and fluid.  Bullet Journal has helped me immensely and I can´t help but be excited about new features to come.  Thank you.",5,4,1.0,2018-08-17 20:36:41,,

purchase it. I basically just paid $3 for information that I had already 
read and gotten from the bullet Journal website and from the book I spent 
20 something dollars on. I don't know what the Apple app includes but some 
of the reviews here lead me to believe that it's way more Interactive. I 
didn't need to pay $3 to be able to set up reminders to check my BUJO daily 
as I have an app for that it is called a clock. Also if I'm going to take 
the time to enter task etc for 72 hours I would like it too stay there for 
longer but I can actually do this on my own by simply sending myself a text 
message with the appropriate symbols. I guess really when I went into this 
I had no idea of what I expected but after the long wait for such an app to 
even exist and then to be made available for Android I would have been more 
than happy to wait the additional time that it takes for this app to have 
the updates to it that have been annotated in this comment thread to be 
included in the original. It's very disheartening to purchase something 
only to be told oh we're creating an update that is going to be sent out 
later this year I don't believe I read it but why wasn't that included in 
the information about the app prior to purchase. Sorry guys thumbs down on 
this one. I hope this promised update is worth the wait cuz as of right now 
I'm not feeling it. I wasn't able to find exact statistics on Android users 
versus iPhone users and the one that I did find seemed a bit biased but I'm 
not sure... it had Android users at 51% versus iPhone users at 49%. 
Regardless of the validity of the statistical information you can look at 
iPhone sales versus Android sales of smartphones and see that the Android 
market is just as viable as the iPhone market. So my question is is why do 
people keep pushing out these apps to iPhone first totally negating the 
Android User population.? I would think they would be equally important 
because think of all of the sales of the app that you missed out on because 
of the lack of an Android app. And now that there is one it's not 
sufficient in comparison to the already year Plus available iPhone app. 
Also with the large Market that the bullet Journal phenomenon has created 
there's already significant viable competition of other bullet Journal apps 
available. I've read articles where people have given up on waiting for an 
Android app from this company and gone ahead and moved on to something else 
as a result. I can guarantee that this app is not anything to make them 
come back anytime soon. Again I'll wait and see what the update has to 
offer. I've already spent my $3 and invested my time. I just hope 
ultimately it's worth the wait.",2,11,1.0,2018-08-16 14:55:46,,
