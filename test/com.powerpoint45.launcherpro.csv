One small problem with my Nokia 8.3, the home button setup on this phone sometimes stops responding properly and won't go home from any screen on any app, the only remedy is a phone restart. Restarting the launcher from its settings doesn't work. Otherwise a very clean app and some nice features. Maybe a future update might fix the home button issue.

So far the only thing I noticed that was strange was that when sending apps to the home screen it stacks them on top of one another when I do a lot of them. Also, when I make folders it stacks them on top of apps. I can move them but still why do that ? Love the swipe left for app drawer and swipe right for Internet search. I also like the features In have found so far like the built in browser settings by swiping in from the right on the search page.

If you love Nova (Pro) or Zeam, you'll love Lucid Launcher Pro. Try the free version out. It's the most affordable Pro Launcher out there at $2.  The first thing to get past is it conforms to Android Application Designs regarding menus & swipe actions. That means *no persistent icon bar*. There's a slideout Favorites available, but if you use just 2 or 3 screens, it's far easier to put the Phone icon on every screen - it would have been there anyway but on bar.   Take a personal challenge. Use the free version, give it a week. If you have multiple devices, put it on all them. You need complete immersion to try it out as the ""schism"" is too great between launchers. The confusion will make you abandon the challenge. You are effectively breaking a bad habit.  Then after the week (or better two) challenge, try out your old launcher. It will feel slow, bloated & awkward. You'll then realize, you'll need to go Pro for $2.

Slide technique is fantastic and browser is better than chrome and as good as dolphin. Developer responds promptly, couldn't ask for better. Works with many different icon packs that makes it even better. Outstanding support ,best that I've came across with any developer on play store.
