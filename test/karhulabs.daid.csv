Also I fashioned a drawing (light box -see help video on app) to hold up my phone steady over the paper and turned on the app flashlight. I can draw and paint but was having trouble with perspective and just needed outline of subject and it's perfect for what I will use it for. I went ahead and bought the paid version to get rid of the annoying ads. Thank you !!!,5,24,1.11,2019-05-28 06:28:47,,

You see both your drawing area and the image you took -- you can adjust the opacity of the digital overlay allowing for easy tracing.  4 feature requests please:    -(High)LOCK THE IMAGE.  when I am changing opacity, it is too easy to move the image   -(Mid)Save Image settings...  sometimes I will have the camera mounted and want to switch between 2 or 3 images and I would like to be able to restore, in particular, the skew setting but also zoom and position for an individual image.     -(Low)Manual Camera focus -- auto doesnt always work so well   -(Low)Auto adjust skew based on camera angle (if you wanted to be fancy :) ) thanks again for a great app.",5,3,1.10,2016-04-26 14:58:07,,

Lg v10 looks like it works great on it.  Awesome tool. : if you made this app so certain photos could be searched for that would be better. I just get all my pics then it stops loading. .......           At first I was doubtful but tried it and wow what a great tool. I do think a person who has at least basic sketching skills would get more from it than some one without..

I liked it and will keep on using it. A bit more functionality and flexibility would be nice, like being able to rotate the image so you can view it in portrait mode, and also so you can rotate the phone180 degrees so the phone can sit on the artist's left hand side instead of just the right. It would also be very handy if the zoom control was easier to get to and had more zoom.  It is a handy app, I hope it keeps on improving.",3,2,1.6,2014-12-11 18:36:05,,

I got this for my mother, the artist.  She paints from photographs in her art class and doesn't do well with proportions in her work.  This app works GREAT on my older tablet, but not on my Galaxy S4 phone.  It's easy to figure out ways to support a phone (such as on a cardboard box on its side with a hole for the camera), but will take quite a bit of ingenuity, which is hard to come by in a ""non-handy"" family, for the tablet.  Plus my tablet is really heavy for her to carry to and from class, along with all of her supplies.  I can't get the app to recognize  and import photos on the phone.  It only ""sees"" 2 (identical) photos.  I emailed the developer some time ago, but have yet to hear back.  This actually rates 2 stars because of that.  I really want to love this app, because when it works, it's terrific; otherwise it is a waste of space and $.   Since my mother can't figure out a smartphone, she would be using one of my devices. I was even considering getting a no contract phone for her, just to use this app, but without any developer support, that's not going to happen.",2,2,1.6,2014-10-15 05:48:02,,
