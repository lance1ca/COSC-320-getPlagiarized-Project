I personally have issues enlarging the most recent pic. It always shows an older one. Not really worth the money.. Edit: thank you. Yesterday I tried to delete app data, but it didn't work. Now it does! :) Thank you for your promt reply :-)",5,1,1.0.5,2019-08-09 03:29:33,"Thanks Franziska,

The Reiki group I made it for uses the top picture to check from anywhere on their phone whenever their feelings changed. It's just a simple convenience App.

The photo reloads when you click on it.

Edit:
I'm so glad that it worked out Franziska! Thanks for your kind review. We're here whenever you need. :)",2019-08-09 15:44:51
