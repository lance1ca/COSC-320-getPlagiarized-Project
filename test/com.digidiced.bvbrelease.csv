This mobile adapation is great and has potential to be better. Some things need tweaking and optimization. 1) The game is battery hog and needs to be optimized to use less power. 2) I want to see my opponents online status (green if they're in active in our game, or red if they're not). 3) Turn history would be nice to have. I pay close attention to what my opponent does and it isn't always clear what move they made, so a text log of what happened would be helpful. The lag time on an online game can sometimes be annoying. If I leave the game open and my opponent takes their turn, it can takes ages for my app to switch to their board and show me what their move. The map rotation tool is finicky and doesn't work well.  Complaint about the games against the AI: I feel like my rolls are ALWAYS set to something I don't need. I know that it could just be bad luck, but when I play against the level 3 opponent, I end up using so many actions to get workers because I never get a roll that I need. It may be a conspiracy theory of mine, but I really feel like the computer sets my roll values and they're not truly random. HIDE THE SCORES UNTIL THE END!",3,14,6,2019-06-27 09:13:37,,
