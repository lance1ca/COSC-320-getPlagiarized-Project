I quickly grew tired of the limitations of the standard Philips Hue App. I have 12 Hue Color + White bulbs on my party patio. I wanted an app that simply sequence the lights as one group. I've spent MOST of my time within this app in the mood settings. The disco portion is super neat but most of the time, it's just me chilling out on the patio in the evening hours. If I'm hosting a party, the disco tab is the perfect place to control my lights. As of 03-15-2019, Philips released their Hue Discover Outdoor Color + White lights. They are nice and bright, at 2300 lumens. I purchased 3 of them so now my Hue Disco App controls all 15 of my outdoor patio lights. However, I've run into an issue. Hue Disco controls all of my 15 lights perfect from my phone. The issue is this: When I run the  mood routine within the Hue Disco App, it plays beautifully until my phones' screen darks out. Once my screen darks out on my phone, the Hue Disco App immediately stops and freezes in mid-cycle, leaving me with a single color on my bulbs. As soon as I ""wake"" my phone, the Hue Disco App starts back up again. Any suggestions?",3,5,3.018,2019-03-15 19:01:36,,

This would be better than having to reconfigure the app every time it is used. I prefer strobe at a certain speed and have to set it up every time.

I looked a bit further into the issue... Installing Google Play onto the Amazon Fire tablet won't solve all the license issues.

You will have the same problem with all apps contacting the license server or validating in-app purchases.

The amazon tablets are not a 100% compatible with google play store apps in that way.

The app does not disable the video, but uses the microphone to listen to and react to the music.  Currently there is no way for an app to use the microphone if it is in use by another app.

So it's not a bug that we can fix. Only option currently is to use another device to record the effects.
