Fun, nice tactical game. I just think cavalry needs some other benefit to make it more meaningful. You know, cavalry is supposed to engage, and then break off. Perhaps after you order them to fire, they move back a square or two?? The whole point of cavalry units is to harass. Really they're only good for charging artillery, and disordered units. But EVERYTHING is good against those. The cavalry is good for spotting, and quick movements. Perhaps some extra tactic would make them better",5,12,2.05,2020-07-11 10:49:40,Thank you for your thoughts.,2020-07-23 07:31:33

ideas? One would be the addition of more factions like the Russians or the 
Austrians. Polish would be nice too and so would Sweden. It is always fun 
to use different factions and this will add a larger diversity. Second 
would be support units like the fifer, drummer or flag bearer. These could 
act as medics or morale boosters or stat bonuses for nearby troops. Third 
is the addition of more sandbox maps or a map maker. This would make the 
game awesome. Also, I read a few reviews stating the wish to add 
multiplayer. You could experiment with Bluetooth as it connects two or more 
phones and they could do a three way battle or something. 2v2 or 4v4 or 
similar game modes would be nice. Thanks.",5,11,1.51,2018-07-10 09:10:30,Some interesting ideas to think about here thanks! ‚ò∫,2018-07-12 16:40:18

The core mechanics are easy to understand and fun, although there are some head-scratching moments. (Our cavalry gets torn apart when engaging artillery in melee? Even when that's supposed to be our unit's strength and their unit's weakness?) The main drawback is a lack of balance. In the Waterloo battle, the French will bring in the Imperial Guard as reinforcements. All you can do is pray that the enemy AI will go haywire and send half of them off in the wrong direction (this occasionally happens - but bad AI with overpowerful units is not the same as game balance) because any sort of concentrated assault will sweep you from the field with little ado. Say goodbye to 1-2 hours of work getting that far and say hello to ragequit. We'll be withholding our extra stars until the game isn't an exercise in wasted time and frustration. Edit: Upon further consideration, we believe our concern is less with balance than with a lack of a way to rewind play to an earlier point.
