I got a tablet, so I decided that I'd get the Android version. After struggling a bit, I figured I can send profiles and recipes from one to the other using the ""Cloud"" which allows to share 15 recipes for free. I was also able to copy my equipment from the Desktop version to the tablet (transfer a recipe with the right profile to the cloud - check the profile details within the recipe and save to your mobile instance). So people that complain it's not possible to go from one to the other, please try and check online info before complaining. I think the 15 recipes for the free cloud account is good enough to get you going. If you want more, you should get the full cloud account. This being said, the UI is not the greatest - I agree. I guess you get used to it after a while, but It's not the case for me yet. I'm used to have the desktop brewsheet printed where I can check off things and write readings so it's easier to follow. But, the essential info is there and that's the important. I do think it's a good tool that needs getting used to it. It does allow me to plan and execute my brew day using a recipe I developped on the Desktop verstion - that's all which is important. Therefore, I guess it's an allright tool for me.",4,0,3.1.10,2021-02-07 08:58:36,,

Not liking this one. Version 3 has lost and corrupted some of my favorite recipes. Nearly half of my saved recipes are not found, or another recipe comes up in its place. Hours of work developing and refining recipes are lost forever. Some of them have been made and adjusted over multiple brew sessions. Even some of my recipes stored on the cloud have been affected! What's the point of paying for the gold membership if your recipes are just going to get lost or ruined? Update: I deleted all the corrupted and lost recipes. Then a couple of days ago, I found some that were corrupted and thought I had missed them. I deleted those and carefully went through every recipe I have saved to make sure there weren't anymore that I might have missed. Then today I discover another seven that are corrupted. I've now lost well over half of my recipes and some of them have been tweaked and refined over multiple brew days. Years of careful crafting and fine tuning have been lost. I'm really upset with this and going to start looking for something to use besides Beersmith. I'll be letting my Gold membership expire if it's not fixed by then. Maybe even if they do. It's so frustrating to lose all that work. Oh, and the Brew Day timer crashes and doesn't work.",2,10,3.0.4,2018-08-27 08:11:03,,

For one, the interface.  It takes some getting use to.  It also isn't feature complete as the desktop version.  I can usually begin designing a recipe using the mobile app but then need to perform the final adjustments and tweaks using the desktop app.  The limited, free recipe sharing via BeerSmith's cloud is annoying.  Constantly having to shuffle recipe around, especially when co-designing/co-brewing.  One can work around the issue on the desktop app using a cloud sharing service (i.e. Dropbox) but not so with the mobile version.

I've been a user of BrewSmith for several years, wishing for a mobile version with recipe portability.  I'm happy to say, this app doesn't disappoint.  While it doesn't do everything the desktop version can, it sure is feature-rich, particularly things you need on brew day, which is why I got it.  The timers are very handy and the ability to enter brew session data (such as volume out of mash into kettle, incl pre-boil gravity, etc) make it convenient to stay on top of the process.  I also love being able to start planning a recipe on the desktop, move it to the cloud, and continue through a mobile device.  Shopping for ingredients should be easier as well, although I haven't used it for that yet.  The app had its hiccups when I first started using it, which I reported to the developer via e-mail and their forum.  The developer's reply was fast (same day), with an app update fast too (next day!).  This is not to say expectations should always be the same, as response time varies depending on many factors (including the complexity of the fix), but this sure is reassuring and shows commitment on the dev's part.
