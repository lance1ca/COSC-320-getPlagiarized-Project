End of day, over 3000 vertical  difference between ski tracts and my avocet watch.  I was hoping ski tracks would have an accurate GPS altitude reading. Showed me going down hill while sitting and eating lunch. Took same lift and had a different  vertical reading on each ride. Any clue why. One of main reason to get ski tracks was to keep track of vert feet skied and it is not accurate. Any fix?",4,30,1.3.10,2018-03-22 18:19:06,,

Definitely the best lightweight ski tracking app.  This app would be perfect if you could set a ""base area"" to automatically pause when you entered it, and resume when you left it. Make it customizable in shape and size, maybe with multiple selections.  At my home mountain, all 180 vertical feet of it, the app doesn't recognize each run as a run so I have to count the number of peaks in the altitude graph. A run counter that will automatically adjust to the mountain size would be great and the algorithm shouldn't be too hard to design.  Lastly, I would like to have an option to have a persistent notification when it's paused, reminding me to resume tracking when I head back out.

It has all the features and more that I could ever want for analysing my ski day and always seems accurate.   The android wear compatibility works great, it's easy to use even when access to your watch is restricted by gloves and thermals and coats as you just need to swipe to navigate the stats pages, each of which provide all the info you want without getting your phone out.   Also it stays on the page you last left it on when the watch goes onto ambient/sleep so you can leave it on your favourite page for quicker access. Only thing is that it does use noticeably more battery life than normal if you leave it open acting as the watch face as it requires the watch to be constantly running the app. However it's not so bad that the my watch (lg watch r) can't last the ski day running ski tracks - it loses around 50% on a 7 hour ski day with ski tracks open compared to around 30/40% with the app just open on the phone and the watch on a normal face. Maybe a few ski tracks watch faces we could download from the store would better for battery life.

It then provides the data, maps and export options I want to review my day.  But I've downgraded my review from 5 to 3 stars because there have been few updates in recent years and long standing issues remain unresolved.  For example, once in every few days the apps randomly stops tracking. This happens on all my family's phones (Sony and Samsung). Also, it can't handle downhill lift rides - it assumes you're skiing. Finally, the average speed includes all stops, etc, so is meaningless. A record of the average moving skiing speed should be added.

The on-device analysis and visualization is very nice (integrating with Google Maps means you also get labeled runs on supported resorts), and export to KML + Google Drive made it dead easy to view runs directly in Google Maps and Earth.
