My kids love it and (unlike all the others I have tried) it doesn't assume the user is an infant. Even an adult can use this to practice or develop their own cursive skills.  And the customizable word list completes its value. However, there are a couple of things I hope will be addressed in future updates. Most important item is the lack of a way to exit. I do not appreciate having to shut it down externally, and those with too little tech knowledge tend to take these things much less calmly, heh. And I am experiencing a small amount of lag, especially toward the end of the tracing. It's not much, but it does reduce the otherwise positive experience.I hope the developer will address those items, but even the way it is now I am happy to recommend this app. Good work!",4,8,1.4.4,2015-04-28 22:25:35,"Thanks for your feedback.
