This was to support you because i will not actually use it (yet). The reason for this is similar to the feedback from the previous reviewer (Omanji Sinkala) ; there is no recording function (yet). I was happy to read that you think that you could easily implement it. This function is crucial also to me. The same holds true for my brother that i create music together with. He (and i am sure many others) will buy the app when recording function is implemented. It is really gladdening to see that this app is in ongoing development!
