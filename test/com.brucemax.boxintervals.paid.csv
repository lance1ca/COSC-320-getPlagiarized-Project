I have a number of customised setup up's with regards to work rest ratios and the app works well all the time. If I had one request for further updates, it would be that the app could lower the volume of the music that is played by my media player while the boxing timer makes its round start/end sounds.

It's the right thing to do and so long to those irritating ads. Unfortunately, when you make the switch from free to paid, your profiles don't come through. That's a lot of tinkering, adjusting and contemplation lost along the way. It's a small point, but a rather relevant one, if you happen to spend a lot of time setting up profiles. Beyond that, this is one fine app. I've experimented with a few, and so far only this one allows you to customize individual rounds so deeply. The option to change the rest time per round is sweet. Good sound options, too, and this is the only app I've come across that has the vintage CLACK, CLACK, CLACK to warn of the final ten seconds of a round. I think the developer should add the voice of Mickey growling, ""YOU'RE A TOMATO!"" for those days when you just can't get through your heavy bag workouts. Although, the option to add our own sounds is there, so maybe I'll add it myself. Great app.",5,2,2.8.4,2016-05-18 22:28:35,Very appreciated for such detailed review! Thanks!
