The things that let it down were the length of the game it was very short and there was no bonus game, so value for money was very poor, and sometimes the hidden object scenes were poorly lit making it very difficult to see what the gs were.  However, there was an option to swap to mahjong so it was bearable.",4,0,1.2,2016-07-21 16:46:35,,
