There'll be more add-ons for sure. The VA-Beast is still new, and add-ons will get built soon. The next update will bring sequencing functionality in form of a polyphonic step sequencer. Furthermore the synth gets multitimbral, then you can use up to 12 concurrent synths at once. ",2014-01-26 04:14:30

Any idea of having a full fledge DAW in the future that will allow us to create real pro like music in the near future? Plus do you guys work on making a PC version for your programs. Caustic 3 is actually available free for the PC for you guys who likes to make music on your computer as well as on the go. Making these programs into a powerful DAW for the computer and tablet would be really nice too. Hope my comments and pointers for the future help better shape the way we make music today and tomorrow.,5,1,1.2.1,2014-01-11 09:45:35,"Thanks a lot for your feedback, Stephane. There'll be a G-Stomper Beat Studio integrated version for sure;), the integration is already on progress;), e.t.a. around end of February. Once the mobile DAW is complete, I'll definitely think about a pc version, vst interface, etc. ",2014-01-11 23:13:10

As a producer it's nice to have something on my phone to keep the creative juices flowing. Has most features  found on top DAW synths. Ever thought of making a vst version for DAW's.,5,1,1.0,2013-12-21 02:15:29,"Thanks a lot Daniel. And there'll be more in the upcoming updates, one of the next will be morph groups. 
So far, I don't have plans to port it as VSTi.. but yes, why not;)",2013-12-21 09:53:26
