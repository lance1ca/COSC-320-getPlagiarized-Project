But It's built around in app purchases. Such that players cant enjoy the game in its entirety if they don't spend real money to upgrade cars. The cars are woefully underpowered for races and currency rewarded in the game is barely enough to upgrade. Not only that but the currency is rewarded only once so even grinding is not an option. Don't buy this over any other similar free to play racing game.,1,8,1.0.45,2020-05-25 02:24:34,,

The controls are easy and the graphics are outstanding, but I do have 1 little problem; on my S3 mini the game can become very jerky and can fail to recognise my steering (mainly when it gets busy) which can be annoying by puting you in last place in a part of the scenary.

Can't stand when people complain that a $3 dollar game is expensive. That is the reason why there are bs freemium games in the market that are built to squeeze money out of its players. Don't become them. Charge more for your game. One star docked because game is unstable and crashes a lot on my shield. I had to dock another star for some grinding. You have to grind on the quick race to get coins if you make a bad mistake and buy a bad car and burn your coins on upgrades.,3,11,1.0.10,2014-07-09 19:47:20,We will investigate the Shield stability.
