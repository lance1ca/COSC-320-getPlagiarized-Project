That part just sucks and it kills the game. Fix that please! Also, when we have it on the forehead it still says to put it on the forehead.  Fix that too! Right now, because of those two annoying problems, it's not even worth the 99 cents that I got it for. The free ones are better. The game is fun but the problems makes it annoying.",2,7,1.1,2013-05-27 09:23:22,"Hi, Thanks for the review, the free version and the paid versions both share the same mechanics. Depending on the device, it will help to slowly tilt the device up/down and make sure it is not slouching left/right when on forehead otherwise it will not detect as being on forehead. We will still issue an update to make this easier! Thanks again.",2013-05-31 20:26:44
