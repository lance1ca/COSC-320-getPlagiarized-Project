It works flawlessly and does everything a torrent client should be able to do. It works with my home vpn, too. Worth the money. One thing it needs is the ability to sort by #. It's in a different order when I view it on my app and I don't see an option for it.",5,0,1.1.1,2021-01-31 21:36:52,"I am glad you like it. Thanks for your review. The sorting may be a bit different from webui, it can be improved, but it may not be exactly the same.",2021-01-31 23:06:54

Solid app. Thanks to quick developer response I was able to solve the only minor issue I had.,5,0,1.0.9,2021-01-15 06:17:00,"Thank you for your review. When the server polling, the alternative speed limit status, category list (if the previous result is empty) and the remaining space of the server will be updated, too. Perhaps one of the APIs is not supported on your server. I tested app on qbittorrent version 4.3.1 and it worked well. Email me if you encounter issues.",2021-01-14 21:58:47

Much easier to add webui details for one behind a reverse proxy too.,5,0,1.0.8,2021-01-09 04:54:57,Thanks for your review.,2021-01-09 06:08:45

It seems to have all functionality that is currently available through the webui for qBittorrent, and I'm noticing no issues using any of it so far. Some nice work Dev! I do have one suggestion: consider removing trailing spaces from the server address when a server is being added. I ran into that problem at the start.",5,1,1.0.6,2020-12-27 18:36:29,"I am glad you like it. Thanks for your suggestions, and the translation problem will be fixed soon.",2020-12-27 18:53:05
