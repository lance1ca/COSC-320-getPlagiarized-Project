I purchased this game at full price because of how great Fran Bow waz. But this game was a huge, but better looking, dissapointment. So linier with no puzzles, that it might as well just have featured a ""next"" button in one corner. There is no gameplay, basically just a cartoon. But it works, and there was an occasional bit of humor.
