I used their guidelines for images and got very different measurements each time, with as much as a 10 mm difference. It would be really helpful if they had a green line to position the card when you open the camera, because it seems like that's the biggest issue people are having. I can't get those green lines to line up straight for anything. It also doesn't say if those lines should be with the card or between the edges of the card and your cheeks. The instructions and the sample images seem to be different.   I also have to hold the camera at a really odd angle to get the picture. When my phone is  at eye level for me, I have to tilt my phone pretty sharply to get my face in the circle. I have short arms so maybe that's why.
