I was taking the practice exams on all 4 chapters that is a little over 200 questions. I was consistently scoring 97% only missing 4-6 total questions on the practice exams. I ended up failing my DO test with a 68% I would try something else.,1,0,1.2.221,2021-02-07 12:39:07,,

I'd like to see an option to select between metric and customary units. The metric questions have thrown off the results and tracking improvement.,4,2,1.2.221,2020-03-04 12:20:59,,

Lots of questions similar to the test. The test had many questions on hydrant colors and classifications. There is nothing like this on the study guide or text book. I had to look it up on ifsta essentials. Also there were multiple questions on stand pipes. I found a few of the questions on here helpful.,4,2,1.2.221,2020-01-03 20:52:51,,

It's too easy to accidentally close an exam you're in the middle of. It would be nice if after the exit button were pushed there was a second window to ask you if you really wanted to exit the exam.,4,2,1.2.221,2018-03-08 09:52:41,,
