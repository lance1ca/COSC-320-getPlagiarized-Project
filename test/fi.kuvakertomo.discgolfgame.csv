Yes you can switch from right to left before you start a round but no option to throw a RHFH during the round which would allow more a more organic game play.  The ability to throw a roller shot, extrem anhyzer with an understable disc will just fizzle out about 100ft with no roll. Those physics are not correct. Maybe I'm being a little too harsh, but I did pay $5USD for a cell phone game. These issues won't/doesn't stop me from playing this awesome game when I can't play in real life.

There are plenty of great UI concepts for sports games for things like putting, free throw shooting, etc. Why this game refused to adopt any of these is beyond me.  Since course and player progression is based around performance on holes the inability to putt consistently creates an instant wall in the game.

It really does capture the fun of going out and playing without actually going out and playing; however, it's marred by control inconsistencies.  It's fairly annoying to go for a simple 150ft upshot and having the controls freak out and send you a measly 50ft.  The putting is also horribly inconsistent.  The same swipe from 30 feet out can land 15ft short or go sailing over the basket. If you do happen to make it into the basket, there's a 50% chance that the rubber band chains will spit the disc back out at you.  Control issues aside, it's a fun game.

The disc flight is beautiful and seems fairly accurate.  It takes a while to figure out how to throw but that is the same for disc golf in the real world.  I like how you must release the putt at the right level and it took me a while before I realized it wasn't going to work with a full swipe of the finger.  Please keep improving this game, it would be nice if you could lean out on a shot, throw forehands, rollers and thumber/tomahawks and it would be nice if you could skip the disc instead of it always skidding when it hits the ground.  Alternate camera angles and replays would be nice too.  Keep up the good work!",4,6,1.0,2016-09-13 16:08:32,,

I do however agree that the coin earning system takes way too long to be able to upgrade your player or buy additional discs. Adding a forehand shot would also be nice to keep things interesting.
