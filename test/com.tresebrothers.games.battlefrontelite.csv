In this game you command every action for a team of soldiers in mechanical suits called Leviathans. Turn based combat with multiple class types. Now what really set this game apart and makes it a deep experience is the deep level of balance and polish this game has received.  Many updates with fan suggested balance and changes, not to mention Dev experience with making games mean the UI is finely tuned for a mobile experience. Another importand part of this game I wanna point out is  tree of unlocks which is HUGE, this is where you unlock new equipment, gear, talents each class has access to but new classes as well. This tree is very well balanced which I find rare in many mobile games, with such a large variety of options you are really given a lot of freedom to build your Battleforce the way your want. for example right now I have Paladins which are a sword and board class which can heal, so a melee medic, and the Hydra which is a aoe flame based class. With these two and the standard Soldier class which specialize in overwatch commands I'm able to play in an agressive playsyle that let's me clear, advance, and hold while progressing thugh each map.  Just the way I want to, but could easily pick some dual wield Berserker class unlocks and make mincemeat out of anything that gets in your way, or snipe from afar with tree unlocks that give your scouts access to powerful rifles and talents which increase the damage they put out.

The reason is that I wanted to experience most of the campaign, but I found myself loving the higher difficulty levels with Iron-man enabled. This mean't that I kept getting crushed at various points and kept starting again.   This is where I think I can now safely provide a review, at least from my perspective. The fact that I couldn't wait to make a fresh start each time and still felt as though the tactical choices presented every game were still fresh and relevant is the highest accolade I can give to any game. I've never felt the need to 'tone'down the difficulty just so I could see the rest of the story and content. I just enjoy those tactical situations so much.  So, all that said. This game is inspired by games like Space Hulk. But they have created their own universe and fleshed it out enough to make it stand out on its own. By 'they' I mean the Trese Brothers who have done another amazing job of bringing PC level complexity to mobile devices. If you like squad based tactics with unit progression done right, then Templar Battleforce is for you. No IAP's, constant development and improvement, what's not to love.

THE GOOD:   Fast-paced action.  Better graphics and music than the original Templar Assault.  Intriguing mission design. Each series of missions has a unique challenge.  Lower difficulties are forgiving in that they will restore all fallen templars at the end of the mission. A large research tree with few pitfalls; you have the freedom to customize a force to your playstyle, exactly as it says on the tin.    IMPROVEMENTS FROM TEMPLAR ASSAULT (the previous game) :  Facing is no longer an issue.  Ammo is now infinite, which is important since you face infinite enemies.  Mid-level resupply.  No need to buy equipment, or sell it ;; if you have researched it on the requisition tree, you can use it IF your squad member is able to handle it at all.   CONS:    Main campaign is somewhat short, only five or so campaigns. Replayability comes from repeating the same campaign at a higher difficulty level.  Tech tree is somewhat confusing. Tutorial mission 3 is as hard as later game missions, and may be a stumbling block for new players.",5,1,1.2.17,2016-01-06 15:15:27,,

With several different classes to choose from. The combination of squads and tactics means there will be hours of game play for you have fun with. One of the coolest features of the game is taken from the lore about the Templars. With their genetic memory, they can call upon their ancestors training and reapply their Attributes, Skills, and Talents any time they want. You'll never have to feel locked into a certain path or like you've made the wrong choice in leveling up your characters. The amount of Talent and weapons combos alone will keep you busy for hours trying out all sort of great tactics and play styles. Don't forget to stop over at the TB's forum also.
