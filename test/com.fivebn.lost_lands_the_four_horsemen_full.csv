Great graphics and sound. The story is cliche but manageable. Too much fetching of illogical items from very far maps. I had to hit the hint button a lot because although I knew how to solve the puzzle, I could not remember which map it resided in. The troll wanting to talk through every item description was annoying.  There was a puzzle partially hidden behind the item/possession possession tray so only it could only be solved by trying all possible combinations. Finally, the main character did not fit the story, and she never looked in place at any scene!",3,3,1.0.34,2017-04-15 06:49:17,,
