Open source means that you can read all the code, it's here: https://github.com/owncloud/android/
As you have access to the code, you can also build the apk yourself, then you don't have to pay for it.
Have fun! ^el",2018-05-14 08:53:36

Using FolderSync for more complex syncing these days as the owncloud client definitely is _very_ bare-bone. At first, simply naming this ""owncloud"" is a bit misleading - it should possibly be ""owncloud file client"" as it is limited to handling WebDAV/files and ignores anything else owncloud has to offer - calendar? vcards? Plus, even in transferring files, the app leaves things to be improved: Making the storage folder configurable would be a start - I definitely would like to have this on external_SD in my device. Same, a real folder sync would help - this is basically impossible at the moment (if I manually create folders or files in the owncloud folder on the Android device, the app still doesn't see or transfer these).

There are folders (of which ""Work"" seems to be the most important one) which simply don't synchronize. I guess it is because the syncing process halts at some moment, but if you compare the speed with which Dropbox shows folder content and with which Owncloud shows folder content --> that's a huuuuuge difference.
