end up getting one or two shotted, even when wearing the vest available

with heavy armor but still get immediately killed. In the end, kiting and 
ranged combat felt alot better. Another thing is the restricted use of 
crystals. Only pets are permanent and worthy investment, but you need to do 
it per character. Overall way to restrictive game. Controls are OK, but

One recommendation if the dev is listening: add a bit more diversity in the way you can use attacks.
