All the reviews about the errors of validating the license are true. Worked the very first time loading but not since on a brand new 2019 Nvidia Shield TV Pro. Still broken as of 12-25-20. Guess the responses from the developer about it being fixed are lies. Edit: Looks like the Google Play Service had stopped working for some reason and restarting it lets the game run. Wonder if that's the same issue everyone else is having.,4,8,1.1.19,2020-12-27 07:58:30,,

I bought it with real money. And now it's incompatible with it? This is not acceptable! There is also a need to open those apps to more devices. My Shield tablet is aging. A lot. And I have quite a few games that I have bought that are only compatible with the Nvidia Shield range. And I'm not that interested in buying a Shield TV, originally I wanted to be able to play those games on the go. I recently bought the S6 Lite tablet to replace my beloved Shield Tablet and I'm sure it is more than capable to run those games (software limitations not withstanding, I've heard about GLTools and all that). Something needs to be done about that. Sorry for the low rating but that makes me a little bit sad. Thanks I'm sure the game is great, but WE NEED to have the possibility of moving the game to the SD card. I've got the 16GB Shield Tablet and I have now a very limited amount of space free on the internal storage. Lots of other game allow the move to the SD card, why not this one? Especially with a 4GB game, it's ridiculous. It's the more than a quarter of my internal storage considering the OS already knock a few gigs out, there isn't much room left for anything else. I hate having to resort to bad review to make a point, but if one game needed that option, it was this one!",1,2,1.1.17,2020-10-04 01:17:36,"Sorry it has taken so long, but we now have move to SDCard support as of version 1.1.9 that will be out today on GooglePlay.",2015-07-30 16:24:08

It runs very well on the shield tablet and I cannot complain about any of the technical aspects. My score is purely driven by the fact that this game is just bad. It was created at a time when, because of brilliant games like Half Life which had a compelling way of integrating story into the game play, developers thought that all games had to mimic that style. Doom really doesn't benefit from that kind of design, it just gets bogged down. Aside from the overly used mechanic of things suddenly jumping out at you the game is tediously slow moving. Doom was always about running and gunning. Lots of monsters, lots of guns, and lots of ammo. This game is about dimly lit, claustrophobic passage after passage with no clear way forward. The game would have been helped out immensely by a way point system. As it is the game is just frustrating. I cannot recommend this title.

What I've noticed since the last comment I had posted, is in fact, that the battery and the 'charging block (not the USB cable),' produce the exact same amount of heat. I've tried different power outlets that produce slightly different voltages, and the results are slightly different. Older structures, can actually destroy and/ or increase the 'heat' dramatically, while newer homes, the issue(s) is slightly better. The charging block coinciding w/ the battery, creates this heat issue. My unit still runs some titles but 'more demanding' processed (ie: Doom 3, Half-Life series, or any graphic intense structure) titles, the stability is impossible. The unit itself is great. Just the battery and charging block need more attention.

Only the X button works to open the map.  Secondly, DOOM 3 requires a public Google + games account, which I have.  Sadly the game wont log into it so DOOM 3 won't launch.
