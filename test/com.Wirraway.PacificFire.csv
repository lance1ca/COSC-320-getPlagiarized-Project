Tutorial kept dialog screen up entire time so could only view 20% of map. Agree with reviewer who mentioned changing deadline or doing something different. When both occupy same city need better commands to attack enemy. Subs can't bombard per your info pack so needs Target shipping option. Have Uninstalled. May try again later but right now it's not for me.,3,1,,2019-12-30 11:35:39,Thank you so much for the feedback. The latest update should fix any issues with the tutorial dialogs.
