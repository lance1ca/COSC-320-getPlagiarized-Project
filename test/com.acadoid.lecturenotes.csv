I mainly use this app as a note taking device that replaces my paper note pad. Recently, I projected my Samsung Tab S3 onto a TV using Roku so that all of my writing in the tablet can be seen in the TV and my graduate students can see the writing much better. This is by far the best note taking app in the Android system. I have tried several others. The things I like are: (1) the writing is very very smooth. You do not see the difference from witing on paper. (2) the note is always there and can be found long time after. (I started to use the LectureNotes after I purchased my Samsung Tab S3 in summer of 2017). (3) the zoom function is very neat. You can double tap and it becomes 125% zoom. Double tap again, you return to the original 100% zoom. (4) the app provided a lot of control in the setting, which I think is very useful as a frequent user. (5) more recently, I figured out a way to back up all the notes in PDF format into my Dropbox flder. This is very helpful because I can now access my notes in my Window 10 computer. (6) It has the back up feature to back up all the information into a zip file in Dropbox. I would think that I can import the zip file into my new tablet. (7) It seems to me the app does not take too much of the Tablet space. I could be wrong on this. The file size of the zip backup 140MB. I have a lot of notes (around 100, all of them are hand writing with mostly 10 page or more.) (8) it allows me to create a lot of folders ad sub folders. This helps me to get my notes organized.",5,12,2.8.7,2018-12-15 10:03:15,,

New users may need to spend some time to figure out which settings they prefer and customizing their toolbox, but it is worth doing so.  The simple to use snap to grid tools are very useful if you are drawing plots / writing math or engineering-oriented notes.  Versatile export / share funtionality.  My only gripe after using for over 3 yrs is selecting layers is sort of clunky (need to drop down a menu to see what layer you are working in or switch active/visible layers - I would prefer the active layer / layer toggles to be displayed in the toolbox or somewhere where it was always visible, because sometimes I forget what layer I am working in).",5,0,,2017-06-17 12:37:28,,

So there's no way I couldn't give this 5 stars and A big thank you to the dev. But goodness, there are so many very simple and basic things provided by those other programs that could be done so much easier here. Like picking a color for pencils is so difficult here, or cropping an inserted image, or selecting objects (like an image, or a line), that well, are made here extremely difficult. You can still do these things but it's very tedious. If it wasn't that the program has so many other things that make up for these short comings and if I didn't see the effort and obvious dedication the developer has put into this program, along with the customer service they provide,  then I wouldn't have given it 5 stars.

Some usage notes;- I tried the trial version first, liked it so bought the full version. It installs as a separate app, so I had to use a file manager to cut and paste the notebooks I had written into the full version directories, but I found that my settings did not transfer so I had to set them up again.

I export all my professor's slides to pdf and then import them into LectureNotes and add comments and examples where necessary, however, my current solution is to, every time I get a new set of slides, convert the slides to a pdf, export the notebook as a pdf, append the slides pdf to the notebook pdf, and then re-import the whole pdf as a new notebook. It works, it's just kind of a pain. And because you can import one pdf page at a time, I don't see why you couldn't import a range of pages. Anyways, that's my two cents, GREAT APP!

I also think that importing and exporting pdfs is faster than with SNote. It is very customizable, smooth and for the most part very easy to use.

I just bought the Note Pro 12.2. An amazing tablet by the way. If you love the Note 10.1, the Note Pro 12.2 will blow you away. I know since the Note Pro is new, there are some differences to expect on how this app works in this new environment. I found when taking notes in split screen using Lecture Notes, I cannot take notes on the right side of the screen. I must put Lecture Notes on the left half of the split screen and whatever my other open app is, on the right side. The Note Pro is large enough to allow for this and more. I used to do that on the Note 10.1, but the screen was almost too small for that purpose. Anyway, new support for the Note Pro 12.2 would be great. Also, the Note Pro lets you open multiple instances of the same app. I would love to see this offered in Lecture Notes...I would be willing to pay extra for an add-on capable of such a function.

One can tell this developer has really put in some time thinking through many of the ways someone might use this app and has provided a vast amount of configuration. Sure, as always, there is room for improvement and I am sure this developer is focused on just that based on the quality of what has already been done. IMHO this is currently the best app available for handwritten notes...Android or otherwise. Since there is a free trial version, I won't go into any of the functional/configuration details so I suggest...get it, learn how to use it and buy it to support this Android developer!	Great App...get it!",4,4,2.4.3,2014-01-26 12:03:39,,

For those who claim it is disorganized or has a daunting list of options, then an apple OS (or Apple app such as notality) is better for you. Android greatly relies on user-tinkering. The customizability of LectureNotes is indeed very powerful and, after spending quite some time familiarizing myself with the options, I have created a powerful writing app that allows me to write quickly and in the aesthetic condition I want. At first, it may seem that this app is lacking when compared to some Apple lecutre apps (like Notality), but after customizing it to my needs, I am able to surpass my friend's Ipad note taking ability. One thing I hope they do, to make it even nicer, is to make it vector-based. Then this app would blow Notality out of the water.

Unfortunately, the PDF plugin turns all of the pages into images so that I can't edit any of the text or highlight words or anything. Additionally, when I export my notes as PDF, everything is merged into images so that the file sizes are 5x bigger and I can't search or copy any previously searchable text. In all my years of schooling (I'm currently in med school) I've always had my lecture slides provided as PDFs. If you want to make an app named LectureNotes, please get better PDF funcionality. I don't need things like sticky notes or shapes and whatnot but being able to search my notes in manageable file sizes would be invaluable to me.

LectureNotes allows me to take these notes without the hassle of a bunch of notebooks or papers to keep track of. I can be reading a physics book and decide to work out one of the exercises. Rather than getting up to get paper I just work it out on my tablet, and have it there forever. Moreover, after installing PDFView, LectureNotes opens pdfs (actually converts it - taking a little bit of time per page) and I can take notes right on the pdf, with the option to turn off different layers of notes at different times. For writing solutions to homework sets I don't have to type it all up - I can simply hand write it in the style that is most natural for me and then export to pdf to send to others. Search functionality, uses pen buttons, scrolling with finger, write with pen only, and many more options.

Not here. And if the menu is in the way, you can hide it, though I never do (it is small and moveable). I was also surprised to find that, after importing .png's of notes from other aps, they were editable.

I tried using the default notes application and felt short of what I wanted.  This application was absolutely perfect to replace all my notes.  It is quite responsive to the stylus.  In landscape mode it is a stunner - jaws dropped when I did the 'whiteboarding' on my Lenovo.  The page is larger than the screen (and customizable) and can be configured (patterns or plain).  The developer of the app is very responsive to feedback and I can only see it getting better.  Great potential and hope to see more users.,5,0,1.2.2,2012-01-16 07:31:03,,

After meetings I export to PDF, and back up the PDF to my external SD for safe keeping.  Fantastic, I almost never use paper now. I have all my notes encrypted and secured. Not to mention the pdf files are searchable, were a stack of paper in a folder inst so much.  Dev constantly updates and is always rolling out fixes quickly for user request and issues. And this app dev doest ask for unnecessary permissions that the app doesn't need to operate like lots of apps on the market. If you have a think pad tablet. Buy this you won't regret it.",5,0,1.2.2,2012-01-13 17:40:40,,
