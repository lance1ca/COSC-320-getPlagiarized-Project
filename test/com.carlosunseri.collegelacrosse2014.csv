The goalie is absolutely terrible, the controls need to be more responsive, and a ton of random glitches need to be fixed. You guys are probably focused on the console game but please make some improvements because id like to be able to have a good mobile lacrosse game too.",3,14,1,2014-12-18 20:14:04,,

But honestly guys this game kinda sucks. It has so much potential but face offs make no sense, it's impossible to play D, both goalies are absolutely terrible you can score all the time but you also get scored on constantly. Every face off if you lose you can count on a goal against you because it's impossible to get back and play D and the goalie never makes the save. This game could be great but needs works.",2,7,1,2014-12-18 18:40:47,,

The defensive-checks are terrible. I love everything else about it though. But overall it's not that bad. There is plenty of room for improvement.,4,6,1,2014-12-18 13:17:37,,

Faceoffs and running are still a little screwy, as well as delayed passes and shots. Other than that, its a decent game.",4,1,1,2014-12-17 15:47:16,,
