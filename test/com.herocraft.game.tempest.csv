Useful for leveling but renders them meaningless for story - boarding action isn't a choice. If you accidentally wander into the boarding circle you are boarding whether you wanted to or not - boarding and ground combat suck. Controls aren't good. The camera during boarding combat is an extra enemy to worry about. - takes a really long time to make money BUT I still give it 4 stars because ultimately it's about being a pirate and sailing and the ship combat is a joy.

When I managed to figure out what to do (after a few minutes of clicking through menues), I set sail, but I got nowhere. Then I tried pressing on the minimap on the bottom left and it took me to the world map (that would have been really nice to know from the beggining). I followed the green markers and fought some pirates. I was told to find some guy en route to an island ad there was a big green circle on the map, only thing is that after sailing in the area all I managed to find was a pirate to fight, but then the green zone was gone. That's when I decided this was not even close to being fun to play.",1,3,,2019-10-11 21:48:16,"If you have any questions, please contact us at support@herocraft.com, we will gladly help you.",2019-10-15 06:16:42

I had to play for a bit to figure things out then start over before it became enjoyable.  A few things that could be worked on:  The tutorial could be longer and more in depth. The ""?"" icon is somewhat helpful with little details in the beginning, then it's useless.  There should be some sort of difficulty scale on missions you get from different ports. There's no way to tell what your ship can handle before you take on a contract.   When purchasing items at the discount ports, you can only buy one at a time or the price shoots up to normal. This is very annoying when buying in bulk.  You should be able to dismiss crew members. If you want to hire a 3 star but your crew is full of 1 stars, you're out of luck as far as I can tell.  There are stats but no description of items on what they're for in shops. You have to buy something before you figure out it's an enhancement and what it works with.

If I can't win anything, I can't improve my ship, but if I can't improve my ship, I can't progress.  Even with the difficulty set on low, the game is still insanely hard until you can acquire a better ship.  On top of that, you can't raid anyone without losing points with that faction, leading to not being able to visit their ports.  Save yourself a lot of frustration and pass on this one.
