The AI on hard level is unusually challenging (for me at least). The game itself plays very well. It's simple to learn but hard to master. Random set up makes the tactics in each game different, as does player count. It's a very different game with 2 than with 5. It's also very quick to play with games lasting maybe 10-15 minutes. The artwork is top notch and the app functionality very smooth.",5,0,1.1.8,2021-01-31 09:39:37,,
