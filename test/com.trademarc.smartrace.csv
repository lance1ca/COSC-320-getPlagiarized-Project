I have to say, in the short time I used it, I am very happy with how easy it is to use and how well it works.  I do have one minor issue, but I am not sure if it something I am doing or just a glitch in the system a whole. When restarting a race under caution, the race resumes but a split second afterwards the race pauses again as if the track is under caution. This is not the result of a false start either, as I had this happen  with only myself as a driver and a ghost car, and the system does alert you when there is a false start. This issue doesn't happen on every attempt to resume the race, but will happen 2, possibly 3 times during a 50 lap race.
