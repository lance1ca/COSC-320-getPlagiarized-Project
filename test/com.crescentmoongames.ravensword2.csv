But it isn't there just yet, as there is room for improvement. Here are the downs of such implemented controller support: #1 The game will now move on after the initial screen after Unity detects a HID controller is connected to the phone and working; [OK] #2 Character customization screen, menus, conversation dialog options are touch screen only; [NEEDS FIX] #3 During a conversation, I can pass the dialogs with the A button, but I can't select a conversation dialog with the same button. I have to use touch control. Why is that? [NEEDS FIX] #4 I get close to an NPC, press X and it triggers conversation mode; Once the conversation is over, why can't I get out of it using a physical controller button, such as B? I have to use the 'Bye' touch control. Ugh! [NEEDS FIX] #5 Touch controls aren't supposed to be ""printed"" on screen after Unity detects an HID Bluetooth controller - I suggest using the custom buttons menu and give us an option to NOT display touch controls. Furthermore please update the game input tutorial to mention physical controller buttons, not touch controls, after Unity detects a controller is working during gameplay; [NEEDS FIX] #6 The backpack is accessible with start button, but once in there, there is no way to move to the next tab, which is a pain, especially when I need to check the map every so often. Switching tabs in the backpack should be done with shoulder buttons (L1 or R1) [NEEDS FIX] #7 There is no way to access or edit the four quick access slots using a physical controller. [NEEDS FIX] Guys, HID controller support for this game is here, it just needs some fixes. We can do this!

I beat the game in about 2 days during my down time. Best grinding spots for gold is the goblin fort to the right of the eastern forest you can get about 100 gold per goblin after selling the bows($60-70), after mid game grind the dark elves cave, they give you roughly 800 gold per after selling there bows($600-700) and keys($199)...you need to save all runes you pick up during the game because once you equip them you cant unequip them. Dont bother with buying every armor just stick to the leather and grind out some gold once you get to dark elves cave after boss battle itll give you best gear. Raven sword can be found in the statue in the middle of south aven. Best weapon to grind with is BLUNT hammer you can get it in north aven but the ravensword is really the best weapon in the game. I bought both small and large houses and you CANNOT decorate even though you can buy furniture and paintings. DONT WASTE YOUR GOLD LIKE I DID.

The graphics are understandable,and the control is pretty smooth. Buuut there is a problem or 2 with the gameplay. To begin with, if you attack a giant in the north, your player stays frozen for a bit, and unfreezes just in time for him to escape the attack. Also,It might take quite long in order to generate an area after fast travel, sometimes making the loading screen freeze. I quit the game while it was frozen, and next time I opened my save file my player was met with the absolute void, and he of course died a few seconds later. I restarted from my last save, only to realize the VOID was my last save. I had been playing for 3 hours. At least you could make it be able to load the save before the last one . One last thing that is pretty annoying is tha fact that you use the exact same face for many npcs. What?

Also the cap on skill lvls should always be 100. You shouldn't be forced to keep stats even like that. For example if you are lvl 5 it will only let you get to like 30 stealth and then no matter what you do you can't get any more stealth experience until you lvl up your main lvl.... That's bogus in my opinion.,4,66,1.3,2018-09-12 16:25:27,,

So great job, By the way what is it going to take for me to get the Ancient Realm.  But if you added all those suggestions youd have a game you can either charge more for or a better game, but theres no ancient realm on mine, I wanted to find a blood-black ruby and go against nightmare creatures, and the special swords had no function.

I really dont have anything negative to point out. Graphics are great, story seems gripping enough. It feels like a game rather than 'Just another android game full of empty promises' if you get me. It does deliver on its claims. Controls are some of the best ive seen yet in this type of game on android. the scheme really works, you adapt to it after a few enemy encounters. just make sure to change the sensitivity in the options, Touch controls are never gonna be a 5 anyway.

Also when fighting it seems like the character does not swing always when the melee button is hit, instead he gets sort of twitchy and it sounds like the weapon is being swung but it's not. Also, this one isn't a huge deal, but it would be great if the character kept turning if you hold the control. Instead it seems like he turns to a set distance and then you have to swipe again, sometimes having to swipe a few times to turn all the way around can take a bit of time, especially when a bunch of cave trolls are stampeding your way to crush your soul.

You state on the main page that this game is Moga pro controller compatible, but judging by the last hour of f****** around with this game I can honestly say you must have tested that theory with emaciated gerbils. mode a didn't actually do anything. upon startup it just asked me if I wanted to use the controller, but it had no intention of following through with my answer. mode B actually went a step further. It refused to let my game even start, with a nice frozen screen upon startup. I guess it would be one thing to live with this, but then there are other small things. For instance, where the hell did you get those screenshots? I guarantee you did not get them from this game, because with my settings all the way up I got something resembling Old Castle Wolfenstein on the lowest settings possible. it looks like dog s*** splattered out of a cannon on a canvas woven from the bones of tortured souls.

Would have given 5 stars but there are a few things which need addressing. 1: Real shame there's only about 16 or so very short side quests and there are no decision based, multi-part quests at all. The only decision part is accepting the quest or not. 2: Quest marker is a bit buggy and hard to find/follow sometimes. 3: Not enough chests, and could do with respawning random contents for longer playability. 4: You can buy houses but there is no real way to store your stuff (you can’t buy a chest etc). 5: There’s no gems later in the game to enhance your stuff as you have already used what gems there are earlier in the game. 6: As well as the small map of Avan it would help if you had a choice of a bigger map.  7: Does crash rather a lot after the loading screen going from one area to another.

Graphics: 2/5: Buggy and unclear. Mount&blade from 2008 has better graphics. Gameplay: 3/5: Repetitive, archery is overpowered, magic is non-existent. Lore: 2/5: Lacks logic, too little side-quests, main quest-line is too cliche RPG. AI: 1/5: NPCs wander around, monsters don't do anything even if you attack their friends.

There are pretty much only two options how to develop your character and that is ranged (bows and crossbows - put points into agility) and melee (swords, axes, blunt - put points into strenght), magic is not an option since, except a few runestones useful only to complete the main storyline, there is NO MAGIC AT ALL. Some skills, features and many items are only there to be there and have no use whatsoever. Also, for an rpg the game is quite short (about 7 hours to complete the main storyline and most of the side quests - which are really simple and uninteresting). Gameworld is pretty big (for mobile platforms) but lacks content (1-2 caves in each area and thats it...). The advertised decision based quests is just a lie since the very few decisions there are have literally no effect on the outcome, the gameplay or the gameworld whatsoever.

There is a serious lack of NPCs, and most houses either cannot be entered, or have nothing of interest inside. The world isn't as open as we are lead to believe. The main town of Aven sits in the middle of the world, and whichever of the four exits you choose (North, South, East, or West) you can only continue in that direction. On top of that, there are typically only 3 locations in any direction, and only one is an actual dungeon, and a pretty small dungeon at that. As for combat, playing with sword and shield is reminiscent of past Elder Scrolls games, except for the lack of various power attacks, and shield bashing. Archery is completely unfair, as most enemies are melee only, so you can simply walk backwards and stay out of their reach. Also, I really wish there were boss battles, in the main quest dungeons, and maybe even some puzzles. Clearing a dungeons is very unfulfilling in this game.  This studio has potential, and I hope the next installment is leaps and bounds over this one.",3,0,1.3,2014-07-31 01:08:53,,

Stunning graphics, beautiful world, amazing detail. I recommend it for fans of the Elder Scroll series. I'm not saying it's on Skyrim's level. But as close as you'll get on a hand held device. Have been playing for an hour now with no issues. EDIT: The longer you play the more the challenges faced by developers for optimisation become apparent. There are huge frame rate drops in some areas, and blatantly poor draw distance in others, (with draw distance turned up to full.) In other areas like Tangelwood Marsh, where the graphics are stunning, draw distance is optimised and frame rate is better, but enemies tend to spawn out of thin air two feet away. This is especially amusing when its a 10 meter tall dinosaur. The game is still very good for the price and considering how hard it must be to make a versatile game for the mobile platform.

Secondly, e-mail support provides no feedback, no responses, and the Crescent Moon web site is similarly worthless. The good news is this game is pretty good. Controller support seems well done, and the tutorial messages reflect that you're using it instead of touch. The game play is somewhat simplistic (this isn't Skyrim regardless of what others may say) but it's fun.

The world isn't  large as in Morrowind or Oblivion, but should we really be expecting them to be? Let's remember that we paid upwards of $50 for those games, and just $7 for Ravensword: Shadowlands. With that in mind...  This game is amazing! The graphics are stunning, the combat is exciting, and the world is large enough to justify exploring in depth. There are several mounts, homes to purchase, and side-quests to conquer. Overall, this game has more than enough content to make us feel good about spending  seven bucks.  For the developers: Usually, when people give the developers ""tips"" to improve the game, they are either SUPER obvious (""I want more swords and armors! Whaaaa!""), or they are totally implausible (""Why cant we craft items? Or farm? Or specialize in herbology? Whaaaa!""). Some things to look into though: buying a home seems pretty pointless, you can't really be a magic based character, the benefits of some of the traits are so great they make the others seem useless.

Its a 60$ console game for 7$ on mobile devices. Its using touchscreen control mobile devices which is inherently more difficult as every device is different. The button sizes are good and can be customized to any position on the screen. I thought the 500mb download was miniscule compared to 1-3gigs other games demand.

First thing that comes to mind after playing about 10 hours is that this is as close to an open world RPG that you can get on a mobile platform. You pay $7 and you get a full game! Yes you can spend real money to get in-game $ and advance levels. But you def dont have to! I LOATH free-to-play games that make it impossible to play without spending money on micro xns. This aint it! You have a main quest and pleanty of NON-FETCH side quests. Char models can look a bit plastic but still a Great game!!,4,1,,2013-03-26 18:18:39,,

Ravensword is an absolute improvement over Crescent Moon's Aralon, and is definitely the best open-world RPG on the Play Store.  My only beef is that it's over too soon. Maybe chock the sequel with more of everything. More loot, more quests, more random dungeons, more NPC's. It's a large game, but it feels a little sparse. I never got the feeling that that I was spoiled for choice and couldn't decide what to do or where to explore next. Still for 7 bucks, it was a pretty amazing experience. That, and the controls are phenomenal. Didn't feel the need for a gamepad once.  Bring on the sequel.",5,13,1.21,2013-03-26 03:21:55,,
