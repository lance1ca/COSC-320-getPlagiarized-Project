It sticks out in a mire of third person and 2.5d beat-em-ups with innumerable currencies and idle clicker games. And well it should, seeing as it's a port of an indie console game. That said, its history on the console rings true, both in good and bad ways. The style and ambiance generated by its design is wonderful, and illustrates its atmosphere perfectly. The gameplay mechanics are uniquely derived, using electromagnetism as its driving theme, which also plays well in boss fights. It almost makes me want to play this with a controller. Alas, therein lies the problem. Its console roots shine through in the mobile port, as the controls are not as exacting as a pad or joystick would be. Sometimes I find my thumb drag moving the young boy you play a hair too eschew to his demise. It's also aggravating to find no controller layout options for users with irregular fingers or larger devices. The inaccuracy goes on to make gameplay already designed to accentuate the clear possibility of failure that much harder, returning the player to checkpoints when he's caught by enemies or touches a hazard. While this might be seen as a Dark Souls-like challenge on console, it can become frustrating on mobile. One example is during a section where, in order to traverse over an electrified statue, the player must affect and rely on pillbug-esque NPCs to react in the exact way you hope to thus guide the player over the hazard. The player's only recourse is to wait until all things align and hope the game reads his jump+charge correctly, and not as a dash into a hazard. Overlooking those glaring moments, the game's environmental storytelling, puzzles, and overall design make it an interesting time and a great time-waster.",3,4,1.5,2018-11-11 21:32:18,,

I'm only 20-25 minutes in (at the first boss) and already loving the game. One thing I'd suggest for the developers is to include the ability to control from a keyboard (that's plugged in or built-in). I'm playing this from a Pixelbook and only the arrow keys work to navigate the character. There is no corresponding keyboard button for jump/red/blue punch.

I usually never pay attention to the music or sounds but they are also fantastic. So far this is a great puzzle platformer. Game has you being chased by grown ups teaching you the controls, then you hit the first puzzle section. This consists of changing the polarity of blocks to make them raise or lower to open up your path to the next section. Checkpoints so far are generous so restarting a section usually does not require a ton of backtracking. This also is great for short sessions which I can appreciate, since my chunks of free time are small. So far I'm enjoying the game a lot and can recommend it to fans of the genre.
