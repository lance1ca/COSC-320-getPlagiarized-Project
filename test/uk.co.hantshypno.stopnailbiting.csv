I have been using it regularly for 3 weeks, and I have not bitten my fingernails. You can choose to listen to the male or female therapist's voice. The Facebook page that goes with it is full of really supportive people as well. I recommend that you use both; do not try to go it alone. If I could make one improvement, I would like to see a few more different sessions (same therapists but different scripts) added, but all in all it is a wonderful app",4,3,2.0.3,2019-10-12 10:29:46,,
