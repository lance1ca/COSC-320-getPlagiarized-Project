Absolutely frustrating. I will try to explain. Navigating between functions gets you lost in a maze in which you can't seem to get free. For example after entering a SN and clicking done, the app takes you back to the home screen. All the buttons on the home screen are then locked out. Confused I clicked back.  Clicking back gets to back to entering your current bill. But the worst of it is trying this on a second bill. I then am found fighting to figure out how many times I need to click back in order to get ""back"" to the correct bill. I have found myself ""back"" on a previously entered bill. Needless to say this makes the app a useless maze of back and forth. Another frustration is it takes up to 3 pictures of a bill, just to get one to be recognized for OCR. Take a picture, approve it. Nope take another picture, approve it, nope take another picture approve it. Finally it takes you to crop the SN. All three pics were perfect, it just wouldn't go to the crop screen.
