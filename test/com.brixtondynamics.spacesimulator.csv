The Guidence system sometimes reverts back to attitude hold causing mission failure. 2 where's the animation on the RS-25 engine's? 3 not all of the controls in the CM work. EG, if I close all the SMRC's the master alarm doesn't sound. 4 not sure if anyone has noticed, the engine sound is on a loop, at the end of the clip there's a really really annoying voice! 5 the Abort control dose nothing.

The game is somewhat playable and somewhat realistic but there are flight physics issues and control issues that make it hard to enjoy. I understand it's a hard game because it's supposed to be very realistic, but this game needs to be fixed and the developer needs to read these reviews so their paying customers get what they paid for.

Outstanding graphics. Hugely ambitious simulator. Unfortunately the game is a little buggy at present, which is to be expected with such an ambitious project, at such an early stage, on such a limited platform,  however this should certainly not deter any enthusiastic, budding astronauts out there.   I would like to see the addition of a facility that would allow the player to plot a course to another planet efficiently and without error as this is very difficult at present. It is entirely possible of course that the facility may already exist and I simply haven't found the way yet. Is this the case? I would also love to see higher detail graphics while at the ground level such as buildings etc  After all major bugs have been fixed I will certainly be revising my 4 star review to a higher score.

Of course you can fly the ships manually. Press the lower left corner for the control panel , with MFDs, manual RCs, flight computers, and all the expected rocket controllability . 

Sandbox mode is already being beta tested so it's coming really soon.
Stay tuned and thanks for the feedback!
