Sometimes it's on the other side of a cliff or mountain range which is exasperating, or if you're like me and try to pick everything up as you go, you spend a lot of time looking for the book or shard, also defeating the purpose. I would rate 5 if the locations were corrected or at the very least a wiki JPEG were added to each lorebook icon with a screenshot of the map player icon/actual in game location from character perspective.
