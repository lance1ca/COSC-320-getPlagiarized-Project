I think this DLC a great addition to the base game. It delves into the world a lot more, letting you get the flavour of different cultures, and helping you orient your PC in relation to how they react to those cultures. Furthermore, it really lets you have some more time with some of the core and important secondary/future LI cast members, which is only ever a good thing. It's great fun exploring each of the offered events with Jun and Ay'cure vs Kess and Umbrave, and how that changes things narratively. I especially loved seeing Kess and Umbrave interact, since we spend most of our narrative time with Jun already, and when we are with the others are not generally in a big group. Overall, it's a lot of fun and I think adds its weight in gold to the game's content. There is currently something a bit hinky with the code, but from what I can tell contacting support, this is not a bug that existed before publication. Moreover, it seems to be an issue more on COG's end that Leigh or Rea's. As such, I'm not letting it impact my score. To my knowledge this is one of the first times something like this has been published, and so it makes sense to me that the system isn't perfected yet. There are a few typos dotted around, but I genuinely enjoyed my experience with this DLC immensely, and would encourage anyone who's enjoyed the content thus far to play it.",5,6,2.0.1,2020-10-22 22:29:54,,

There's a multitude of endings so I'm a little confused by the review saying no, as your end stats+beginning stats as you build you character and make choices are different. Even the passages can be drastically different depending on your skill levels, and how you've treated characters thus far. There are also quite a lot of 'secret' achievements that depend on your answers so it's been fun to go back and try and find the correct combination",5,7,1.5.4,2020-07-31 16:25:33,,

The concept of the story is great and could of easily landed closer to a 4 star rating but the length, lack in depth in some areas, and the poor ending shot it down for me. An important event near the ending seems to require a specific skill enhanced and by that a specific choice you have to make or ""die"", what i mean by ""die"" is you can come back to life but with drawbacks. If you do make that choice, it gives a strong feeling of not controlling the story at all and that you have to follow a laid out path and cant branch out. Its really a shame really, it seemed good with good reviews and has a pretty good concept story with fantasy but this seems really disappointing, im guessing why this is getting good reviews is maybe because of the sequel but im not sure and seems to be a big risk to take since it must be purchased.",2,4,1.4.0,2017-03-14 17:10:22,,

Either way, I was expecting magic and the such when I started the series, but I wasn't expecting such a deep plot. Or to be affected much by my choices. I spent minutes on some parts, deciding whether or not I should do something. I took a mostly objective approach to decisions and was pleased to not be seen as so much of a 'villain'. I ended up with a 30 'The RED' score, but that was mostly from things that were obviously 'evil'. Otherwise I would have had a solid score. The point is, I wasn't punished for not taking the route of your stereotypical hero.  Although I think I might just be ranting now. I'll get to the point. The game, if that's the right definition for this, is wonderful. The game doesn't seem linear, but there was one or two times where I was given choices that I didn't like.
