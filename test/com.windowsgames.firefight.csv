But something has happened with the AI that makes it worse than it was before. It's nearly impossible to get your infantry to move as they are way too careful now more than ever. And whereas before if you didn't put your tanks in the exact perfect position you would always lose them. But now your tanks are generally just target practice for the enemy & are pretty worthless. AI needs to be completely rebalanced.,4,29,1.1.0,2021-02-07 12:58:55,,

Needs a defensive mode were you can defend the computer. The artillery needs to be tweaked first couple shots not accurate then a lot more accurate.

Unfortunately it needs some quality of life improvements. Very hard to see your unit's while zoomed in as a green circle is a wrong colour choice for selected units when the ground is green. In fact it's hard to see units period. I know that camo and concealment are a thing, but I should be able to locate my own unit's easily. While zoomed out you get markers that shows you your unit position and last enemy seen location that are critical parts of info needed to command. Well you need that information while zoomed in too. Text is also way too small to read while zoomed out. The move Bar doesn't work well while zoomed out and is finicky to use on a phone, it needs to be larger for peoples fingers. More options are needed for soldiers, like moving into buildings, throwing grenades or taking Cover. More squad formations would be great too. Need a overlay toggle for map topography so we can use the terrain height to advantage for flanking. AI doesn't seem to give up when I have 2 or 3 squads overrun their position, not a bad thing but probably needs a little adjusting. Overall I like it, it definitely scratches that slow tactical RTS itch from games like close combat and Wargame on PC.
