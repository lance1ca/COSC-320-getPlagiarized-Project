This year we need a mobile version. How do I select pass n play mode? I don't see where I can invite friends.,4,0,1.21,2020-12-22 15:43:52,,

A few glitches. If you touch draw stack when first to play, before rack is full, a null card worth zero is dealt. Playoling to 1,000 goes beyond 5k. Would be nice to keep difficulty at max as a default. Game is fun, worth the $0.99",5,0,1.21,2020-02-22 19:25:01,,

You can tell that this is just someone's personal project as it is very very rough looking. The dev needs to partner up with a designer to dress it up and get the graphics out of 1998. Functionally I havent found much difference between the skill levels. I could beat 3 CPUs at extreme without any problem. Normally I wouldn't pay a buck for this type of app but since it is the only one I hope it incentivizes the developer.",3,4,1.21,2020-01-22 18:46:22,"Thanks for the review Jason. I did quite a bit of testing on the difficulties and can send you my testing spreadsheet if you'd like. When a run isn't required at all or if it's just a bonus the difficulties should vary quite a bit  As for the graphics, I 100% agree. Everything was done by me and the main goal was playability and game settings.",2020-01-23 10:17:15

I do wish that a game could be saved so it could be continued if I don't have time to finish it. When I have to stop, I don't close the app but I always have to start a new one when I get back on.",3,1,1.21,2020-01-22 02:41:00,"Thanks for the review Eva! That's a great feature request and something I'll look into adding in a future update. In the meantime, the game should resume from where it previously was if you put your phone to sleep or switch apps and come back. As long as the app isn't closed completely it should load back up without issues.",2020-01-23 10:19:42

I've had a blast playing with my friends so far and the computer is a great difficulty. If you're looking for a good rack-o experience this is your best bet.,5,5,1.21,2019-06-03 18:18:29,,

This is exactly what I have been looking for. The music is fun and enjoyable, the gameplay intuitive and exciting. It's nice that the developer included so many difficulty settings so that you can have as tough a game as you want. Well worth the 99 cents for a good ol Racko experience.",5,5,1.17,2019-05-26 13:45:03,"Thanks for the review Jacob, I'm glad you like it!",2020-01-23 10:22:48
