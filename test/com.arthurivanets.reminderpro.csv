The main benefit with this over Google Calendar is the ringing alarm, i.e. it's not going to make a quick bleep that you'll miss while out of the room. This App certainly grabs my attention, just like a ringing telephone. While individual reminders work fine, repeat reminders are not reliable, an issue that's been ongoing for about 2 years. For example, if the reminder rings and I snooze a reminder for 10 minutes, it doesn't ring after the snooze time, but instead rings 10 minutes after the next repeat reminder time. The repeat reminder also occasionally skips well into the future, which cost me about €50 in out-of-bundle phone charges for forgetting to purchase a new bundle. In this case, it reminded me on the 15th October, but when I checked why it didn't remind me on the 13th November (custom 28 day repeat), it set the next interval to 1st October 2021! So don't use repeat intervals for important reminders.",3,7,2.6.8 PRO,2020-12-14 12:07:52,,

below about the widget looking funny has never been fixed. Old review: I 
use it for a recurring reminder and like it. One improvement I recommend is 
to fix the widget that shows a badge when there is an upcoming reminder 
that day. It has a lot of blank space between the icon and its written

But..... For the last few weeks most of the time you cannot open the app, it just shuts down immediately.  I made the mistake of paying for the full version thinking it would be ok but it's just as bad.  Reminders still flag up and with the widget I can still add reminders but I can't open the damn app to see my reminders list.  I've reported the problem a couple of times but nothing changes.  Is this a problem for anyone else?  So... Time to bin this and find a more reliable reminder app, which is a shame because this used to be the best.  Update ; After mentioning the problems I was having with the Reminder app the developer has been in touch with me and worked very hard to help me sort the problems out. I can now use the app again and rate it 5 stars. The developer gets 5 stars to for all the effort he has put into helping me.  Many thanks!",5,1,1.9.12,2017-03-25 15:35:10,"Hi Simon!
