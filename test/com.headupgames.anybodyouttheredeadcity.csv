It's not awful, just lacking in subtlety or complexity. Very much a 'this happened then that happened' story. Has nothing meaningful to say, and little in the way of characterisation. Reading time is around 40-50 minutes, maybe a little more with some skippable waiting around. The plotline is vaguely Season 1 of The Walking Dead TV show, but comes barreling to a close incredibly quickly leaving the actually (only one) good idea at the end lacking emotional impact. Would have liked to have seen that mechanic used more effectively, had the potential to be a real emotional gut punch had there been a more developed and deeper character to care about.
