I think that it's excellent!   I use the 'basic functions' of the app, and haven't messed with the messaging features.     My approach to using the app is pretty straightforward in that every time I drop the anchor I'll 'set the Anchor Watch Pro either by using the ""current location"" at the moment I lower the anchor, or the 'advanced' location feature if I've already paid out my rode.  One really fantastic thing that you can do with this app is to use it to check the 'set' of your anchor.   So, after you have deployed your anchor and let out  a sufficient amount of rode/scope  then back down on your anchor to be see that it's holding.   I have a catamaran and will put both engines in reverse at about 1/2 cruising RPM.   While doing this I keep an eye on the app and look at the ""distance from anchor"" number and, once the tension is fully on the anchor, that distance number should not change much.   I've had many occasions in which this little 'feature' of the app has saved me a lot of potential grief because it quickly showed that my anchor was moving.
