I love that you can password protect multiple notebooks. It works smoothly and is easy to understand. However, there are two things that keep me from giving it the five stars I really wanted to give it.  When you pay for this app, you are paying to get rid of a small advertising bar and the inconvenience of accidentally tapping it when you want to use a notebook feature. Nothing more. And that's fine. I like not having it there, so I'm certainly not experiencing buyer's remorse over it. It is the other issue that is more problematic for me.  I have written in to the developer, and never got a response. Every time I have attached an image, and then gone to view it, it says that it is unable to open the image. Update: Image problem fixed with update (intentionally or not), which is greatly appreciated. Still 4 stars b/c of lack of dev response to email over 1 wk ago,though. I would have given it a five otherwise.Still highly recommend this app.",3,4,4.5,2014-10-10 17:12:29,,

Another reason may not be the dev's fault, but typing is extremely slow and unresponsive, making it nearly unusable. Temporary? Not so with other apps. It works great otherwise.

A few qualms though; The menu buttons inside the notepad are confusing and in the way, upon exiting to the home screen (I'm on a Nexus 10) and returning to the document, the colour and text preferences return to default, it would have been nice to see an option to actually draw/insert pictures into the actual document, rather than just as an attachment with an irritatingly small preview pane. Great app, but it doesn't come with all of the practical things one would ask for in a 'pro notepad'.
