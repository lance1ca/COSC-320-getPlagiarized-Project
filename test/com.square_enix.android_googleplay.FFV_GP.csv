Sadly the game simply doesn't work, like many other comments below mention - and this seems to be a problem going on for ages so they clearly have no intention of fixing it. The game stays stuck on Connection Lost, even through phone reboots. The only thing that TEMPORARILY fixes it is reinstalling the game. Their workaround at the top of this page does not work. When you get the problem again, it will be again permanent. It is essentially impossible to progress. Avoid this app, and shame on Square Enix's betrayal for letting this issue persist.

I purchased FFV once last week and it would immediately crash on start up. After getting a refund, I heard the bugs were fixed so I downloaded again. Same problem, now I can't get a refund.

The game looks fantastic and they did a great job updating the look while not changing too much. But they have to cover all the bases if they think they can ask these kinds of prices. Too many Android games out there offer all of this and charge a few dollars or less. If you don't want your games pirated, don't ask over triple the average market price for an android game.

Aside from the graphics overhaul it's gotten a new interface with dedicated on-screen buttons (for things like bringing up the menu, sprinting (which toggles), world map, and even a ""Turbo A"" stand-in ) and the game menu has been re-done as a touch screen interface.  The d-pad is replaced with an anywhere touch d-pad.  The movement is a little fidgety (accidentally stepping one or two steps an unintended direction while moving) but there's not many places where fine control is needed.  A single click (instead of click and drag) replaces the button for interacting with world objects. They've also added a ""save anywhere"" quicksave option and it autosaves fairly often.  I was a little leery of the $15 price point and would have preferred to see it down around $10 but it's undeniably  worth the price for a game you can easily spend 40-50 hours on.

I have thus far played FF3 and FF4 on Android and those were AWESOME games. At one point there were plans to remake FF5 and FF6 into 3D but it was scrapped for some odd reason. When you play a 3D legacy FF and a 2D legacy FF, there is a huge difference in how it feels. The 3D remakes (3 and 4) breathe a lot of new life into the game and give the game itself a lot of longevity. The 2D legacy games are a bit harder to stomach, as I'm learning now with FF5.  Overall this is a good game; not great like FF3 and FF4, but still good. I highly recommend it, but only after you have played FF3 and FF4.

The sprites and backgrounds are also pretty stretched, on a low res device it would probably look okish, but at 720p or higher it's sort of embarrassing.  Character sprites are pretty derpy looking too, compared to the original.  Discontinuity in menu appearances and overall aesthetic in this remake.  A little disappointed.",3,6,1.0.1,2013-09-26 03:58:34,,

Feels like it was done in the same style as dimensions. Thought it was going to be 60 fps smooth like ff complete collection, but the game feels more like it was remade through rpg maker. Dont feel like im missing out much either from playing the gba version.",3,4,1.0.1,2013-09-25 20:37:59,,
