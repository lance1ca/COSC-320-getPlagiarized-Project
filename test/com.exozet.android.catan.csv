However, you'll see that happening a lot if you play against the computer. Suddenly you're leading by 5 points and the dices roll are highly biased towards the computer and then you finally loose.

When an AI puts the robber on the non-AI player's hex, the next dice roll will be the number of that hex.

Have the lead in points? it's a lock you will get wedding cards saboteur or other cards that are useless. no wheat to remove the robber? it will take 100 dice rolls to get a seven. then the very next roll after will be a seven to put the robber back. ai is predictable and dumb. so the only way to lose is for the game to cheat with RNG. very frustrating in this way,3,7,4.6.9,2019-06-20 00:05:55,,

Так как это, по сути, единственное приложение с этой игрой на Андроиде, то поклонникам приходится играть именно в это приложение и тут масса проблем. 1. Игра дико греет телефон и сажает батарею. Так не делает ни одно другое приложение. Ощущение, что вся мощь процессора задествована в этой игре. То ли создатели игры майнят криптовалюты, то ли используют мощности телефона для облачных вычислений - по другому объяснить это нельзя. Даже 3D-игры с крутой графикой так себя не ведут. 2) Разбалонсированный генератор ""случайных"" бросков кубика. Я сыграл достаточно большое количество игр и статистика выпадения чисел далека от нормального распределения. К примеру, 4 и 10 выпадают в два раза чаще, чем 5 и 9, чего быть не должно. 3) Раздражает откровенная игра против меня на сильном уровне сложности. В этом случае все игроки и компьютер объединяются против - разбойник практически не слезает именно с моих карт, а в половине случаев после попадания разбойника на мою карту, на кубиках тут же выпадает число именно этой карты, что чисто теоретически не возможно.",1,1,4.6.8,2018-11-03 09:24:27,,

I think it works great! We had a three-way phone call going on in the 
background so that we could talk to each other while playing. Sometimes, we 
added a computer opponent just to have a fourth player. I also played some 
games by myself against computer opponents. I'm no statistician, but didn't 
really notice any unfair ""dice loading"", but maybe as I play it longer I 
will. I noticed some options for how the rolls are culled, but didn't 
investigate it yet. Only negative, was that in the middle of a game, the 
language changed automatically. Not sure how, but I fumbled around and 
changed it back. Oh, and I wasn't able to play a computer opponent game on 
the airplane (didn't want to pay for wifi). Other than these two minor

year and bit ago on iOS. Recently got around to getting this and all 
expansions again on my new android tablet. On reading the reviews here, I 
am glad I am not going mad. That they HAVE changed the computer player 
difficulties. However I am finding them very much easier... I absolutely 
FLEW through ALL scenarios, winning by a mile, each and every scenario.. 
first time.. which was so disheartening. Not at all a challenge!! Like it 
should be, as catan is a challenging, brain busting game. Moving through 
the playable boards, in custom game mode. When changing computer player, 
moving up their difficulty levels with each scenario... the same. They are 
a whole lot easier to play and win against... which is NOT good. Catan is 
so amazing because of the complexities. The fact you need to use your brain 
and strategise. Change it up when things don't go to plan, finding a new 
plan and way to win! This is missing here now. As it's so much easier to 
win! To the utter detriment of the game. The last time I played this, it 
took me MANY MONTHS to work through all the scenarios, then each custom 
game with every player combo. Not this time... mere weeks! Then the dice 
thing... playing on normal dice settings it is LESS RANDOM than it should 
be and used to be. I think you've mucked this up too? Seeing this mentioned 
in many other reviews. Die rolls skewed against player... but. With how 
much easier the computer players are. I suppose this evens it up and makes 
it harder this way. Not the right way to go about it though! Skewed,non 
random dice rolling is just infuriating. And is CHEATING. And as a huge 
board game lover my entire life, I cannot abide cheaters. This truly is a 
major deal with this game. If you don't fix the AI at LEAST give the 
options for properly random dice again! Even if it's in a changeable 
setting option for the player... BUG ALERT --- Also during a game you need 
to regularly exit your game then re-enter it. Due to losing visuals. Like 
when you hit to see your cards, it's blank. You can't see anything when you 
do have cards. Or when go to build a knight, half of the visuals on that 
screen are just gone. And game exit and entering again is the only way to 
solve it. This needs fixed. I'm not the only one to mention this issue too. 
I never play online due to the game throwers when they aren't winning. 
Makes it all a giant waste of time!! Rankings are needed to help stop this, 
and make it actually playable. I long to Play online! But throwers are 
cheaters... And I've mentioned how I feel about cheaters 😃 4/5 STARS 
despite the issues... it's still good! But ... it used to be 5/5 and hands 
down the best game on tablet for me for years! Please please please listen 
to us, the loyal Catan fan base.",4,0,4.6.5,2018-04-17 05:33:31,,

I am a big fan of this game, actually I played it for years with my friends on  Sundays. Sorry to say that the distribution of the dice is very far from being random as it should. I had a game with more 3's and 9's than 8's. Another with plenty of 2's and 12's but almost no 5's. I played a few times the same board just to test my theory and I was right: the distribution was not completly random, it is somehow board-dependent. I also suspect that it has something to do with the hex that's being held by the robber. The minute the robber is on 6, 6 is the most likely to come. I had my wins and my share of losing, I do not make a big fuss about this but it's just unfair and unfortunately it spoils the game experience.

I have the full version and have been playing for a couple years now and I can honestly say that despite the developers claims, the dice rolls are not random and the AI is diabolical and will make you hate this game. 7 comes up way more than it should, to the point where you will do nothing for multiple turns in a row while you rarely get resources and the AI regularly steals what little you do get. Whatever number the AI is on and you're not will come up more often, even outpacing 6 and 8 in favor of 3,4 and 11. The random die and stack don't have any real difference either, with the stack regularly pulling way more of a few numbers than any other, typically picking digits that the AI is on. Development and progress cards are even skewed, with the AI seeing more Knights and Monopoly while you get drowned in Road Building and Victory Point cards. AI also hoards dev cards and will even make 4-to-1 trades or use Year of Plenty purely for the purpose of buying another dev card. Unless you go out of your way to completely deny the AI access to the resources to buy dev cards, they will eat the entire stack 2/3 of the way through every game - And that's with only TWO AI vs a human opponent. I have never played a physical Catan game with real people where we ran out of dev cards, even with 6 players! Cities and Knights is no better, even if you keep up the same level tech upgrades as the AI, you will see the AI receiving way more of Spy, Bishop and Resource Monopoly while you continue to get Road Building, Inventor and Smith. If you somehow manage to get lucky and score an Alchemist or something useful, rest assured the AI will probably steal it from you. And once you have a steady lead, be prepared to start getting Saboteur and Wedding, now that they are completely useless to you. Don't believe me? Skim through the other reviews and you will see I'm not the only player reporting these issues. Its not random if multiple people are calling out the same behavior, because that's called a PATTERN.",1,27,4.3.1,2018-01-22 19:32:53,"Hi Anna, thanks for having played over 100 games with our app. That is impressive!

It would be nice if it were easier to choose the multiplayer game they are going to join. If you choose the quick option, it takes a while to find the game and then when it loads you either accept or reject, and if you reject you were taking all the way back to the main menu. It would be much better if upon rejecting you were immediately shown another choice.   Also it should be possible to boot people on the screen where you confirm that you are ready to play. If two people drop out in the middle of a game, one of them times out and then you get taken back to that screen which announces they have timed out. But if the other person never presses that they are ready to play, the game can never continue. So if two people leave at once, the game is impossible to complete. That has happened to me twice this week.   If you guys are ever updating the intelligence of the AI, I would make them respond with greater variation to deals that offer two resources or three resources for one. Generally, it seems like they accept or reject the deal regardless of how many cards you are offering them for the card you want. Real players may change their mind when the number of cards is increased. In Cities and Knights, AI does sometimes change its mind if it is offered a commodity instead of a resource, but being persuaded by multiple resources is a different thing.",3,7,4.6.5,2017-12-27 06:47:10,"Hi Matt, we are aware of the auto zoom issues, and we are discussing a solution to it for the next update.",2017-09-29 03:26:06

The dice statistics page is deceptive because it only shows you total rolls for each number, but not how it influences the game. From my experiments I believe the dice works like so:  Before each dice roll, the correct probability of each number is computed. This depends on if you use normal, stack, or stack 5. Then, dice rolls that allow strong moves for and against the human player are identified and their probabilities are weighted, depending on the human player's progress towards winning the game. For example, your chance of producing ore will tremendously decrease if you hold 2 grain, 2 ore, and have a 2 victory point lead.  This system is clearly designed to make games more ""interesting"" by throwing freebees to losing players and slowing down winning players, but it reduces the game to a Las Vegas-style slot machine and ruins the entire app.  ""My  great uncle Theoderich would have cut the programmer's hands off immediately!"" - Sir Sean",1,3,4.6.3,2017-11-14 13:56:04,,

When set to 'hard', the bots don't play better, they just become prescient about upcoming dice rolls.  I don't mind them playing as one team, I don't even mind the fact that they always know the exact resources at my disposal, but their apparent ability to accurately and consistently predict the next dice roll would be terrifying in a human opponent.  Watching one player bot play a knight (robbing me), roll a seven (robbing me again) AND THEN PLAYING A SECOND DEVELOPMENT CARD, USUALLY ANOTHER KNIGHT (letting each bot take three resources from me in one turn) not only explicitly breaks two rules but gets tired when repeated three times in one round.  It happens with greater regularity than seems likely for a coding error.  Why is seven the FOURTH most common dice totals with well over 6,000 rolls?  Also, I've seen four consecutive rolls boxcars and snake eyes occur several times, usually when all development cards are gone.  Why does the plot of dice rolls look less like a bell curve and more like the second IF coming off of an old-style NTSC television tuner?",3,5,4.6.4,2017-09-21 16:54:23,,

The robber should not be allowed to be moved between two tiles of the same number i.e. tile 6 to tile 6.  In the cities and knights expansion, development cards are included in hand size, and it should only consist of resources and commodities.  Starting settlements should not be allowed to be place on a port. They can be placed on coastlines, but not ports.  I'm not sure if this one is just a stream of bad luck or if it's actually programmed, but victory point cards shouldn't be visible to the AI. As far as I can tell, the AI will target the winning player with the robber, and if I'm tied then get a victory point card, I get targeted with the robber. This shouldn't happen because victory point cards are supposed to remain facedown until the end of the game, therefore, the AI should think I'm still tied.

From what I have seen, the dice rolls are not rigged and the AI does not cheat. Also, while the AI players do often team up on you, it is only because you are ahe ad of them in victory points. The problem that I have with the AI is that it is nearly impossible to get them to trade with you. Hopefully, the developers will fix this.",5,2,4.6.2,2017-04-11 16:08:59,,

A couple bucks and you're allowed several boards which will keep you entertained for months.  I bought this month's ago and I'm still playing it daily.  Part of what bothers me about the game is the AI bots will gang up on you if you are winning or have the longest road.  There is also the problem of staying hidden with the victory points.  Say you get a victory point card.  It is automatically added to your total.  This can raise the alarm of the AIs especially if that puts you up to say 7 or 8.  They then start to use their knight cards and targeting you with the robber.  Not so for the AIs.  They can keep their victory points hidden as development cards and then Spring them on you all at once for the win.  This is a huge advantage for the AI.  Something the player should also have or nobody should have.  It is not uncommon for the AI to cash in 3 or 4 points for the win.  All the while the other bots are targeting you with the robber and ignoring the other guy because his score doesn't reflect victory points the way that you do.,5,3,4.6.2,2017-04-07 22:22:24,,

Then much to my dismay there's no way to play with the 5&6 player expension in the app. While I was happy to find that the rules were kept exactly the same and there was a multiplayer option so I didn't have to play against an AI which are obviously no fun to beat although it would be nice if it would show you all the current available games instead of choosing one for you and making you exit and come back in if don't like the one it chose. I wasn't​ to impressed by by the design which is at best avrege. The thing that really shocked me though is that I've noticed at least a couple of bugs so far which have entirely messed up at least one have for me. This is not ok when you're charging $5 for an app and have in app purchases​on top of that. I still play on the app because I'm a huge Catan lover and have had some great games with it.

What's not to like? Well... The dice rolls are ""clumped"" in weird ways, even in the supposedly balanced ""stack"" mode (had one game where 9 was rolled far more often than 6); the ""fairness"" rules are implemented in ways that aren't fair (they steal from me twice and still get a free wildcard resource for not having ""generated"" a resource?!) and the AI's pettiness is trumped only by its stupidity (it will happily play a knight before rolling, steal its eighth resource card from you, and then roll a seven.) The way the AI plays a lot of the time would see a human player never invited to play again- stealing twice in a turn, trading repeatedly with players who are running away with the game, building or ""robbing"" in ways that offer no advantage other than hindering the human player, and offering countless trades of things the player already has in abundance expecting things in scarcity in return. I realize this sounds a little ""sour grapes"", but I do win a solid majority of my games. And despite my grousing, I spend a lot of time with this game, and enjoy it. I've just been waiting for a digital Catan with AI that plays like humans... And I'm still waiting.  ADD Feb 2017: In addition to an ever-increasing disappointment with the AI (don't play with 3 AI opponents. Just... don't.) the game is growing ever slower and kludgier with every new ""update"" while seeming to offer little of value in return. It recently out-and-out refused to launch while I was offline because it couldn't update. I understand needing networked game players playing the same version, but if I want to play offline, I really ought to have that option without the creators' meddling getting in my way. I'm lowering my review to 2 stars, and I'm seriously contemplating deleting it rather than continuing to watch it bloat up in my precious and limited storage space.",2,14,4.6.2,2017-02-05 15:48:43,,

As a result my total resources were 6 instead of 8 & then 10, but when someone rolled a 7, it still made me discard 4 resources, &gt;:-( leaving me with only 2. I tried discarding more wood but it only showed I had 1 instead of 5 & wouldn't let me discard more than 1 even though it was apparently accounting for them for the 7 dice roll. I was in the lead with 8 when this happened twice and I couldn't do anything for a couple of rounds, which I would have been able to if this hadn't occurred (i would have been able to spend enough resources with the wood I should have had the first time to be below 7, and for the next time it happened as well, and I would have had the extra two VP needed to win). Then my opponent who was able to play their turns normally ended up winning instead. This happened in another game also.

If that is a balancing mechanism to make the AI competitive (as some suggest) it is is a bad one. It takes the fun out of the game. One option that should be considered therefore would be to have a ""backwards"" or ""undo"" button that can undo your turn. This would help the player randomise the die roll better if thevthink that the biased die rolling is getting out of hand (some may see it a cheat). Without such a single player enhancement the game as it stands at the moment is not value for money, especially since replayability is too frustrating with the apparent die roll bias against the single player.",3,1,4.6.1,2016-10-11 10:50:57,,

Perhaps double or triple the size of the largest map. 3 to 8 players. More customization with rules and objectives. Some C and K rules would be great. Especially a no commodity C and K map. No card map. Etc etc. Give some customization options. I would recommend this game if you got everything for like$4.99-5.99. As for online play.

Then, to reduce the appearance of this, the game makes sure a number you've settled comes up whenever the Robber is on it.  Even with this 'correction', the skew is so far beyond anything one might consider reasonable as to make the whole game feel like an exercise in futility.  Finally, the Robber bounces around back and forth on your properties in an almost-laughable manner.  All of these lead to one thing... Round after round of you having to simply pass your turn due to lack of resources.  And that's just not fun.

Guess what got rolled? 9 and 8 were the most frequent numbers next to seven  and six was the second lowest only eclipsed by 2. 5 and 4 were also in the bottom four of dice rolls. Last time I checked, you can make 4 and 5 with more combinations than you can 11 and 12 put together. The dice rolls need serious work no matter what of the three ""types"" of dice roll is going on. I have gone in two games now without getting any resource FOR OVER 20 TURNS. AIs have over 15 resources and I have 0. Random dice? Ha try biased dice.  Update: The dice are the worse I've ever seen. If the robber is on a 5 and you have a five that is shut off and it's never been rolled, all of a sudden, it's being rolled. FIX YOUR RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR.

Very predictable and not at all random. Then you can expect to see your robber blocked numbers rolled.  My belief is that they do keep the whole set of rolls relatively random in the game so the distribution chart looks right. But very much will add an edge for a 7 if the player is ahead.   The AI opposition also seems to know your Victory Point cards even if not played, where you do not know theirs.   Also, have not been able to make the online work. ID never logs in successfuly even when created fresh.

The game play seems to be right on with the board game.  I read a lot of reviews about cheating dice rolls, but I have not noticed it myself.  Sure there are times when 2 players roll a 7 and a couple play knights in the same round to drain your resources, but if you're ahead in victory points, that is just brutal strategy.  There is no appealing to the emotional side of the AI.  The dice counter shows a distribution graph that lines up pretty well with expected odds.  Also, I don't think your VP cards are visible to the opponents, at least the game doesn't behave like they are.  For example, playing friendly robber, I have a VP card right away, but they still cannot place the robber on my tiles. You can play 2 humans on the same device, though it is cumbersome and not very fun.  There are a several options to play with just the base game, though no campaign mode unless you buy the add-ons.

Playing a three player game against two of the weakest AI players is an exercise in frustration. The majority of the time they only trade for resources you have zero use for and well not budge on what they will trade to you at all. Trading sheep for anything to the AI is not an option.  It's as if they can see your entire hand at all times. If you ever get even a one point lead on them, they will actively target you for all theft for the rest of the game. And once you have close to the resources you need to accomplish something useful, there is an unbelievably high likelihood of the dice throwing multiple 7's in a row, allowing the AI players to drain your resources and lock you out for the rest of the game. I've had to resort to building multiple settlements on ocean edges just to have any reasonable source of trade since the AI is coded to turn down any offer that might benefit the player.",2,5,4.2.1,2015-01-22 03:12:50,,

After the robber is placed to the hex the number is almost always rolled on next turn. If it happens to be your hex. Also in C&K AI players sometimes can activate knight and move the robber on the same turn. At first I thought I'm dreaming but it happened more than once. Like others have been saying AI players happily trade with each other but hardly ever with you when you initiate trade. It's getting kind of boring when you sit 2 or 3 or 4 rounds without getting any resources even you have your cities on 4-9s. And I just lost my city to barbarians - we had 3 players, 4 cities, 3 active knights. 1 was mine and 2 belonged to other Ai. One AI had no active knights. And on next roll barbarians attacked but I lost the city! Not nice. Also noticed that if you share the hex with other AI player and he has active knight and robber gets placed to that hex the AI doesn't often use the knight to move the robber. Not logical at all.

Settlers is a great game but the AI in the Android version must be improved.  I always get the robber even if you are not in first place.  Why?  You should add a difficulty selection or something so I can set whether the AI is playing to win or playing to make sure I lose.   Or at least make the AI make sense.  Also, I cannot prove it but it really seems like the dice favor what the AI has over me.

And I'm glad to see that the update makes the game work on tablets.  Along with appropriate graphics, the menu has changed from the circular ""ChronoTrigger""-esque style to a much more functional side menu.  Now the game lives up to the price I paid for it.  Well done!  Original Review: I was recently introduced to Settlers of Catan - and I was looking forward to honing my skills at the game with my Acer A500 Tablet.  It worked once - the first time I downloaded it and installed it.  Now, it loads to the menu screen, and no matter what I press, it completely resets my tablet.  Completely unacceptable.  What I don't understand is how it ran perfectly fine ONCE, then it didn't.  Fix the app USM - there are lots of Android users out there that WANT this game to work.",4,4,4.0.5,2014-05-21 11:26:44,,

Any avid Catan player should get it because it plays just like the board game, and if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks, you can get any add-on you want and that's all kinds of fun. The only reason this game isn't 5 stars is because I hate the AI. They NEVER trade with me. Seriously, I've tried offering 10 resources for 1 resource, just to see if they'd trade. And still, they refuse. It makes no sense. And yet the AI will trade with another NPC who has 9 victory points, allowing them to win the game. It's ridiculous.   On top of that, so far in every game I've played, the NPC's always, always, always steal from me. Did I mention always? It's so annoying. Even when an NPC has to place the robber on a space that affects both me AND them, they will still put it there and steal from me. Very frustrating.   But from another perspective, the bad AI system does add more difficulty to the game, and so I like that. It just sucks losing when all you need is one wood to win and no one will trade with you (no matter the offer), only to have the very next player make an immediate successful trade and win the game.

I have set everyone to the easiest and I still lose in C&K and occasionally in a normal game. every single game the two big numbers I am not on (Usually an 11 or a 3) get consistently rolled. I get it, its random, but how random?  I can tell I am on easy because the computer doesn't go in for the kill when it should. So why can't I get a small streak of probable numbers? Why do the computers trade with each other so much? ESPECIALLY IN THE END! One traded and one the game!

The AI's ability to steal cards they aren't able to trade from you is extraordinary regardless of how many cards you have in hand.

Also, settlement positions and the current goal of the players in your region also dictate who and what you want to trade with. Even if two players make the same offer, I may prefer one over the other.  Maybe you could implement some kind of behavior where I may slide the trade window down and then navigate the map. I may then slide the trade window up and restore focus to the trade.   I see that I may already (sort of) navigate the map within the narrow margin at the upper most portion of my screen.

This game is now pure awesomeness.  This app has so much promise, but the problems nearly ruin it. I installed it on a 7"" tablet (1024x600), and I'm experiencing two major problems:  1. Button clicks often do not register. This can actually make you lose a game.  2. The scaling of the text and graphics (aside from the board, which can be zoomed) is terrible. The text is tiny and the little icons for resources are almost impossible to make out. It's hard to tell whose turn it is, or which player is me. The colors for the roads and settlements are seriously difficult for a color-blind person to differentiate.  If these two problems were fixed, it would be a great game. One of the coolest concepts is that the use of language is almost absent during gameplay.  One recommendation I'd make as a beginning player: It would be awesome to have a button that showed a summary of the previous turn. Who got what, who traded what, who put what where. Sometimes things move so quickly that I'm not sure what changed.",5,1,3.0.0,2012-11-08 20:20:57,,

There are a lot of user interface issues, for example: text is unreadably small on both my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7, resource dragging/dropping is really glitchy, it takes way too many taps to start a game, scrolling/panning doesn't quite work right, etc.   Most maddening is the computer player artificial intelligence though.  Simply, it's not very good, which can make gameplay exceedingly frustrating at first (while you boggle at its illogical moves) and boring later on (after you learn its quirks and are able to exploit them).  Trading and robber placement algorithms in particular seem very primitive.  I'm a software engineer myself, so I know getting this stuff right isn't easy, but at the end of the day it's still not good enough.

The AI is a bit problematic, it is programmed to rob like crazy when you are in the lead at all, and unfortunately it still will occasionally steal from you when you aren't in the lead. It's particularly annoying when you are in the lead due to Victory Points not associated with settlements or cities, such as bonuses for scenario objectives or longest road, and the AI still continuously robs you instead of better off players (from a resource standpoint).

Most the time the AI rolls the robber and alternates it between your most common resource numbers, even when it does not benefit itself but will benefit one of the other AI characters, that most often is in the lead.  Also if you get a victory point card or two that put you in the lead, the AI knows it and gangs up on you and is much more ruthless when you're in the lead. Yet if the AI has victory point card, you do not know this till they pull out a surprise win. Also the AI seems to get development cards constantly, if your strategy is to get largest army, don't bother; the AI will get somewhere around 4-8 knight cards played within the first 6-10 turns. Best to focus on longest road and expanding, use knight cards purely for defense because you will be doing so a lot.

My last game, I had a settlement on a wood 2:1 harbor and another settlement on a forest hex with an 8 chit on it. Guess how many 8s were rolled after I built that settlement? Also, I had another settlement on a clay hex with a 6 chit and many 6s only seemed to be rolled when the robber was on that hex. Cheap! I may have to go with the event card option now.  However, this app has vastly improved my understanding of what's going on in the boardgame quickly (due to being able to play by myself anytime) and therefore I give it a 4 for doing what I needed it to do. However, if I was rating it based off itself as a replacement to the boardgame, it gets a 3. It's fun and I like playing it but the cheapness is aggravating.

Some elements, such as the game board, scale quite nicely - although they get pixelated, they're very easy to read and interact with.  Some other elements don't, and that's where the game's greatness becomes overshadowed by poor optimization.  The start game menu, and the really nifty 5-item in-game menu don't scale.  The buttons become exceptionally hard to press, which quickly frustrate me to the point of not wanting to play a game - especially in public, cuz I don't want to look like a blind nubby-fingered fool when using my phone three inches from my face and repeatedly hammering on the same button with no effect.
