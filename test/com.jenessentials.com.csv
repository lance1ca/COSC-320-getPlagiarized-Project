It's a little awkward to navigate. The app pages are hidden behind the keyboard instead of being scrollable. I was really looking forward to the My Recipes feature, but it's just one giant text blob, which is not useful at all. I was hoping to be able to add multiple recipes to my custom recipes.  There are not as many recipes and the search isn't very complete. I was trying to search for recipes for acne and got no results. I tried to search for ""skin"" and got no results, but if I scrolled through the list, there were skin recipes. It would be nice to have a more robust search, like being able to search by issue (acne, muscle pain, etc.)  The Pros of this app are that you can add your Young Living Oils that you have to a list and you can mark ones that you want to get.
