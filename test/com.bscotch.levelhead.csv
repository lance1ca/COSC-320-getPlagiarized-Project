As you might assume mobile platformers almost always have abysmal controls. They can never get it right. However this game is a cut above the rest! I feel like I can beat any level with enough practice. The gameplay can last you years since the majority of levels are made by the players. The humor is right on point. It's very easy to make a fun level for others to enjoy because of the amazing editor.,5,11,10.0.169,2020-10-28 17:03:41,,

I love the developers previous work. It has all the mechanics of something great but the entire premise relies on other people making levels. This means you either end up with ultra easy exploit levels to boost or utterly ridiculous overly difficult levels that are mind numbing. Since there is no way to downvote these db levels the game ends up filled with them and it completely prevents the game from ever being fun.,2,18,10.0.164,2020-08-06 09:50:35,,
