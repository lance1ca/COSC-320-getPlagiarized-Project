Basically you're driving your wagon over mountains flying from mountain top to mountain top doing flips and landing upside down 90% of the time causing broken limbs and eventually death.

I see that the MECC (Minnesota Education Computing Consortium) was involved in this. They were the creators of the original game. I'm not sure if they sold the ""Oregon Trail"" naming rights long ago, which is why there are crappy pay-to-play versions in the market and this one is called something else.

Roger Ebert once notoriously said that video games are not art. Clearly, he has never played ""So Long Oregon.""   There have been other video games that try to simulate the hardships of life on the Oregon Trail; for example, there is ""The Oregon Trail."" That game, unfortunately, is known for its historical inaccuracy, in addition to a complete lack of sweet jumps and crazy flying snake physics. This game rectifies all of these issues, thus providing the most accurate and entertaining rendition of life on the trail in video game form to date.   In conclusion: you should buy this game. It's pretty rad.",5,16,,2012-02-24 07:34:32,,
