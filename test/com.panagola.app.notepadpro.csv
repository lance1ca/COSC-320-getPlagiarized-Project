However I wish there were more organisation options. Perhaps leave an option in Settings to keep the little note widget as is, but provide in the settings a way to alter the number of columns in the widget (e.g. reduce the note columns to one instead of two, increase it to three, etc.) and perhaps that would allow us, when the note columns are not locked, to move the notes.",5,8,1.4.1,2016-08-24 13:40:05,Many thanks for your suggestions.
