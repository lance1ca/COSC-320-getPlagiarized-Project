Golf Peaks is those things, and much more. At it's heart the game is very simple: a series of themed areas with a dozen stages on each to clear. Each area introduces a new mechanic, and these mechanics build atop one another as the game progresses.   What is brilliant about Golf Peaks is how it makes learning so effortless. There are no tutorials or text bubbles to work through. The game wordlessly introduces a concept, lets you figure out and then understand that concept, and then slowly folds it into the game so you lean how to apply it in more and more contexts. It's much like learning a language: by the end of the game, you'll see a huge, complex board and know how to read it, because of what you learned on prior levels. It is NOT easy to design a game that works this beautifully, with such a gentle learning curve.   I loved every minute of this game and am looking forward to more from the developer. No ads, no game play throttles, no BS. Just pure, simple, superbly designed puzzles in a fun and relaxing package.",5,18,2.05,2019-08-04 20:02:39,"Thanks, we're super happy to hear that you enjoyed the experience so much :)",2019-08-12 01:25:25
