There are two roles you can play as a journalist and a junior detective the only differences are a few dialog options and how willingly the characters are going to share information. The true ending is challenging but tests your puzzle skills and the reward is great.,4,0,2.4.1144.353,2021-02-06 01:22:07,,

Might be five bucks but it is TOTALLY worth it. The mystery of who took the deal is fun to unravel, and the little scares (like when you open Maya's case file for the first time) are extremely well placed and the cards are truly a work of aesthetic horror.
