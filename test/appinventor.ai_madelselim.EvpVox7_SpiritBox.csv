You will need to let spirits have time to learn how to use it so keep it running for a little bit. I've gotten intelligent replies with this one.,5,0,3,2021-02-05 19:59:50,,

It said my name within a minute of starting it. Was getting intelligent responses, I asked for my dads name and it came through. Then what he drank and it said whiskey, then dram which is a Scottish word for a drink. So many others that's too long to write but I highly recommend this app. Can the static be sorted though it's far too loud",5,0,3,2021-01-25 07:33:31,,
