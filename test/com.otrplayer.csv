Because I really enjoy the extensive programs and interface (without ads.) This App's collection takes me back to my own childhood when I would record these radio shows onto a cassette tapes. Having them all, and instantly accessible - THIS is a goldmine to me! I tell lots of people about this too!   2. The other reason was, I had hoped that it would correct the problem with playing. Sad to say the App now only works intermittently, perhaps it was after the most recent version update  (5.9.2). If I try to play an episode, say from: ""Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar"", then it will skip ahead ""unable to play"", show after show, trying to play something but won't. It then marks them all as having been heard. (Marking it with the 'ear' icon.) This happens, not just to that program and genre, but ALL of them.  Again, I still give this 5 stars, and hope that it will be repaired quickly. I'd hate to have to ask for a refund. (Samsung Galaxy S6)",5,6,5.9.2,2017-05-06 13:29:36,,

I bought this app again because I am a fan of the old CBS RADIO MYSTERY series. I like the fact I can download and save the shows when I don't have access to a WIFI and 'off load' them to listen to on my computer.,5,3,,2011-12-12 05:21:37,,
