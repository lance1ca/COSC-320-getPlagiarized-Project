I have this in my phone and play it for the children when I'm driving. They have it on their tablets and we love the ease in access. You should have the cycle 3 flash cards as well for history. I have already learned a ton along with my children and I love how we can work on past weeks and even go ahead and learn. My son likes to learn at a faster rate but my daughter likes to repeat a lesson many times!
