You can always access a list of yaku (scoring conditions necessary to win a hand), and all the yaku in a winnijg hand are underlined and tappable. This makes learning the yaku easy and intuitive. Tutorials are as brief as possible and well-written.   I'd recommend this app to EVERYONE--beginners and seasoned players alike.  If you watched Akagi, Saki, or other mahjong anime, this is the best way to start playing.",5,0,1.0.10,2017-08-22 05:00:13,"Thank you!

Love the art, tutorials, and in-game reference page. I'd prefer the buttons to be further from my tiles though. Occasionally, I'll hit discard on accident when selecting a tile. Likewise, the ignore button is in the same place as the discard button, so I've once tapped ignore, didn't know if it registered, tried to tap it again, but it became the discard button when it came back to my turn, causing me to discard a tile on accident. A bug I run into often is after a game ends, the button to go back seems to be hidden so all I see is the board with no option to exit. Another bug I found after installing was going through the yaku tutorial, then starting a new game, the board was empty and no tiles would deal. I wasn't able to reproduce it afterwards so maybe it only occurs after installation (Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2). In the future I wish for more features like a campaign/tournament mode, varying ai difficulties, faster speed gameplay, and auto riichi discarding. At the moment, I think the only things better than Maujong are the art, UI idea, and tutorials/reference. That said, I enjoy the game and hope it succeeds!   Something I'm curious about is the decision to order the players so the turns go from bottom to top rather than top to bottom. Starting the game, I assumed it would be top to bottom, but maybe you have a good reason?",4,0,1.0.10,2017-08-21 19:13:33,"Hi Raymond - thx for the feedback!
I'm working on a fix for the ""blank board after a tutorial"" issue... sorry for the problem!
I hope to add more & varied AI routines in time & will see what I can do re: button placement, along with other features/additions (inc. those you mention here). As to bottom-to-top… 'just thought it flowed nicer.
Thanks!",2017-08-22 07:06:20
