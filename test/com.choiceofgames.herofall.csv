This is an author who truly cares about telling a great story through player decisions and I think this trilogy has supased community college hero as my favourite one of these stories which is something not many have done for me.

I've gone back to rate this entire series 5* but my overall review will be here.  You really see the character development of your character from the first book and this brings it to an extremely satisfying end. From the aspiring hero concerned about his job to the champion who knows whats truely important in this one. The second book really forced you to make some tough decisions and make or break relationships with characters you'd really like to keep and to see all your choices come together here and see them support you in the finale felt incredible and heartwarming to read. All the characters were unique and lovable and the situations in all three books added realism to the super hero genre that is rarely done this well. From all the bittersweet endings of the first two to the truely happy ending here (albeit with some tragic losses depending on your choices *I still miss a certain red striped girlfriend*). I have yet to find another interactive novel to pull my heart the way this trilogy has. If you're considering trying the series out. Do it. Its worth every penny. This series is amazing and I can see myself returning to read them all again once the feels have subsided. This is by far my best most recommended read.,5,0,1.2.1,2018-01-07 05:10:20,,

This third installment of the heroes rise trilogy doesn't even compare to the first two.  It was short and anti-climactic.  And the five romance options?  What was the point in that?  There wasn't all that much romantic interaction!!!  I am blown away by how badly this one sucked.  So disappointed.,2,0,1.0.5,2014-09-01 09:43:30,,

I think it would be nice though if the did a prequel to the series and made it were you could play as the sound or the fury depending on your gender and make a series out of that! Or maybe make one that comes from the future after this is all over and there's a new threat with a new hero and new characters but maybe be able to load your hero fall game so the storyline could have some original based things!,5,0,1.0.5,2014-08-29 19:09:32,,
