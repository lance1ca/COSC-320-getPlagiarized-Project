overpriced. It's a good app, but not just not long or complex enough to

MAJOR SPOILERS: This game is about trans, gender identity, LGBT communities, etc. etc. etc. Ad nauseum. While this ""game"" does a terrific job at creating authentic feelings and reactions to someone confused about their identity, it ultimately gives the moral ""it's okay to feel this way and sometimes you just have to run away."" That's exactly what the character does. They leave. The game creates arguments like ""my family is homophobic"" (here's exhibit A) But really it just showed me that close-mindedness is not limited to bigotry. To give a big middle finger to everyone and just leave without telling anyone creates a culture that seems to state ""embrace cowardice"". Run from problems. Even the character's girlfriend attempted suicide when (s)he dumped her and the flimsy excuse of ""I tried calling her but she wouldn't talk to me"" is BS to me. Did you try email? Letters? Going in person? Nope. Just self-centeredness. Yes, it is difficult. But the message this game sends bothered me. However, trying to create awareness, and more importantly, empathy, is a worthy cause and the concept of sleuthing through a random phone was refreshing and entertaining despite finishing it in 2 hours (including reading everything... even deleted emails). Try other games that tell outstanding stories, are trying to raise awareness, and are similarly priced like What Remains of Edith Finch and Gone Home.",4,0,1,2018-03-18 08:07:35,,

It's good to be aware that even in this day and age people are short sighted and they do not know what kind of impact that can have on the person sharing this big and intimite thing about themselves. I hope it reaches a lot of people this way and I hope it makes a lot of people think.  Game play is good and smooth, I found the graphics in you're second game better these annoyed me.

Some people have stated that they finished it in 10 minutes, but if you read through everything (like I did) and try to figure out the passwords yourself, I'd say it would take about 2 hours. Whilst that isn't a lot of time, for only a couple of quid, I don't mind it. For a similar price, I can get a 2 hour long Doctor Who audio story from Big Finish (if I buy one of the early releases, but it's a lot more for the recent ones that I also listen to), so to me, this game is good value for money.

And the way the game makes you progress through the phond and, then, through the identity of Sam is mere genius. The fourth wall (i don't know if this expression does exist in english ?) is sometimes broken, but the major part of the genius of A Normal Lost Phone resides in the way it makes you feel which things don't make sense in society. It puts you just ahead of your own way to see what is depicted in the game, and tells you : ""You see, even you has not seen everything that was wrong before I put it just under yout nose"". Little by little, parts of what seemed normal to you retroactively change in your mind and become terrific, as their true signification is revealed more and more.

I was really into it when I was stuck in a car on a road trip but didn't finish it then because I got stuck. I then came back to it a few days later and remembered what it was I was supposed to do but still got stuck. This brings up the one main problem I had with it. If you're stuck and just don't know what to do after a while of trying, you may be tempted to look up what to do. I did this with a website that luckily just gave a few hints to the puzzle before just telling you the solution. Although, at times some of the solutions made me think that I never would've figured it out without the guide. This is a problem because being stuck doesn't do you any good but looking up the solution really took the joy out of the puzzle you're trying to solve, and because there aren't that many puzzles it's a sizeable chunk forfitted every time you do it.",4,0,,2017-02-18 22:29:24,,

It consistently gives the player ample reason to dig deeper into the narrative, and though I'm sure I could have finished the game without scouring every bit of text provided, the strength of the narrative compelled me to do so anyway. Given that it's a mystery game, there's not much I can say about the game's plot other than that it's quite timely and well-wrought, a story that needed badly to be told. One potential quibble is the sheer volume of text that explicitly serves the game's thematic core, but it's handled well and isn't essential to completing the game.
