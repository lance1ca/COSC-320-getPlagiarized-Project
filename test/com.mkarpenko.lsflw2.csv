The other reviewers don't seem to understand that units get used up when they hit a shield or that upgraded shields have multiple levels which would explain how they don't take planets. I think the game should probably explain this aspect better as these people are giving up and missing out on a great game. It's a very simple and seemingly easy game until you start to try to get Perfect on every level and you begin to realise how cleverly the game creator has crafted the levels to force you to try new and different strategies.

Once the system has been conquered, a new path in real time is shown to a new system where the winner of another system will soon join.

First off, its very touch-trigger happy. I've noticed i accidentally moved 
units from one star to the next without realizing that's not at all what i 
wanted to do; inadvertently i lost some games because i wanted to move some 
units from one star to the next but ""selected"" the wrong star. The 
instructions aren't always clear; for example, it says to change ""number of 
ships"" from star to star, you go into settings. However, you can actually 
dictate the amount of ships you want to send by pressing the ""%100"" button 
on the main game screen, which will show other percentages of how many 
ships you want to send. To actually send ships from one star to the next as 
compared to *Continuously* doing such is possible in the game, but is never 
really explained in detail, adding to further confusion (you click once on 
one star and then click on a second to send ships One time; hold on one 
star and continuing to hold to the next star to constantly supply that star 
with ships over a period of time.)",3,0,,2018-06-01 19:07:02,,

I like this game just like the original and after reading many reviews I can say that there are no control or battery usage issues on my phone. Everything is optimized and well done! It is also lovely to have so much challenging content available, especially when trying to beat everything perfectly, which makes the game worth the price in my opinion.  Still figuring out how to get the black stars without loosing them before finishing the level though. Maybe You can provide us with a little tip, Maxim? ;)  Another thing, a small request from a player of the old original LS..  Is there a possibility to add the old, original soundtrack from LS1 Flash Game from years and years ago? Maybe to choose between the new and the Original to switch now and then? It could make the game even more personalized together with all the skins that are available. I like the ambient Soundtrack, too and the relaxing atmosphere it creates while concentrating. Well done, by the way. But still, the old soundrack rings in my ears and everytime I play, I think about those games long ago and that awesome music everybody should have the chance to enjoy! It would be so much fun to get this old feeling back.   That being said, Im glad You continued Your amazing work with this little gem.  Cheers!  Edit:   Thank You for Your fast response!  I feel very lucky for Your fast response.   I found a way to get the old soundtrack and implement it into my game experience, I can send it to you if You like ;) Thanks for Your efforts though, very sad they quit offering the music.

Sadly, the company/page which made the music I used in original Flash game is no more exists. There was a website in early 2010 called mp3stockmusic, which had a lot of nice tracks.

I just wished the levels were balanced better in the scoring of points for time and actions. The most complex levels seem to have arbitrarily high ceilings for both categories making them extremely easy to score well on while some of the low to moderate complexity levels seem to require that you figure out a very exact sequence of moves to score well.

The second set of 30 will drive you insane, taking you through extremely difficult stages simply because the AI is given a gigantic advantage, not because your strategy is inadequate. Level 2-14 is the pinnacle of this mechanic, and I have yet to see it be beaten.

I stopped playing computer games about 7 years ago and had only Filler and Sudoku on my phone. But this game is really good RTS!

I can setup individual colours, but I'm too lazy and want to have ready-made themes; - bluetooth/network multiplayer; - best scores with publishing to web; (will make it more social) - more levels. 54 is good, but would like more :), - more types of updates for bases, but not too much, not more that 4-5 (otherwise will make it complicated).

It is a bit like real-time Risk, in fact, without the cards or continents. Just grab as much space as you can, as each area gives you more units. It gets very fast & furious, especially on large maps! Maps are also well-designed and do get more difficult as you go.  There should be more documentation! Tips: 1. Press and drag from one base to another to set a constant flow of units in that direction.  2. tap twice to cancel this instruction. 3. with 5+ units, you can either set a base to double its output of units or 'defend' (two buttons on the left, top & bottom respectively). Defend seems to double units' effectiveness and/or kill all invaders if you have less (not certain). 4. larger bases with more bars produce faster.",5,16,1.3.02,2012-04-13 19:01:19,"Hi!
