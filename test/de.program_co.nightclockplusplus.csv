One small thing/question though - I additionally have an alarm clock app, which is hard to switch off in the morning because the alarm is no longer displayed on the screen. Is there a way for an alarm clock to override the night clock screen?",4,0,1.3.1,2021-01-30 18:20:35,"Hello,

I guess you are using Android 10 or 11?
The alarm app should take care that it can be ""displayed above other apps"" when the alarm goes off.
My App ""Radio Alarm Clock"" for example is simply shown above the running night clock when the alarm kicks in. What alarm app are you using? Ben",2021-01-31 02:37:51

I had the free version, but decided I had to make the tiny gesture of buying it in order to give thanks to the developer since I use it so much. My only wee suggestion is to have the option to display only the date below the time, rather than the changing date / battery level. Great job, thank you!
