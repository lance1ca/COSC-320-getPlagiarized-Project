I put it on a bag filled with air and used a Canadian nickel as my control test. At first the measurements were waaaayyyy off. After some playing around I realized that certain areas of my screen (nexus 4) were more accurate than others. So it was a matter of moving the nickel around the screen until the measurement was accurate. To be sure it was accurate I did the same test with a quarter in the same position. It worked.  On average I feel it has a margin of error of about 0.2g when in the sweet spot, but its accurate enough for my needs. (weed)  I would suggest moving your control weight around to see where on the screen is most accurate. After you do this it should work wonderfully.  I would give it a 5 star rating but its such a narrow surface area that's accurate so it loses points there.",4,4,,2015-01-18 20:08:01,,

Do not use a ziploc!! It will never work with even the slightest air leak. The ruler method works very well. Would love to see the buttons be located in center of screen. A large flashing indicator telling you when to place counter weight and unknown weight on phone. And voice activated 'zero' command so you don't have to touch the phone to zero it, would be icing on the cake. I can only assume the bad reviews are due to user error, or device incompatibilities.",4,11,3.1,2014-10-05 10:00:17,,
