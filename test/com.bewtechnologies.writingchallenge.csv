They're generally vague and not worth spending a dollar on. There are websites you can use where you set an amount of time you wanna have to write and go from there, and those are free - I'd recommend checking a few of them out before you spend money on a mediocre app like this.",3,3,,2020-04-20 20:02:55,"Hey, Elliot! Thank you for your review. Websites which have free prompts do exist. But in this app you can save prompts & write in the app itself, so you don't need even need internet to see prompts & write, unlike websites. If you have suggestions to improve the app, please write to us at : writingpromptsapp@gmail.com. We would love to hear! :)",2020-04-26 01:21:13
