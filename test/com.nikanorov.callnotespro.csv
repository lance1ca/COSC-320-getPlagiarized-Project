I love the concept of taking notes on calls but there are two things I have noticed so far that make this app annoying to use. 1. I can't edit a note without switching to the Call Notes app. I don't see why I can't edit the note directly from the overlay. To make sure that this is not a limitation of Android screen overlays, I made sure that I can have a conversation in a Facebook chat head overlaid on a call.It worked fine and my call remained underneath, so it appears that there is no technical reason not to allow the editing of notes without opening the app. 2. After hanging up a call after adding / editing a note, the note remains on my screen and can't be fully closed. I have to swipe the Call Notes app away in recent apps. It would be useful to keep the note there after a call ends but allow me to easily close the note completely (without just minimising it to the blue bubble). Also, the main app contact screen is incredible condensed with no whitespace around the contacts, making it look very crowded.

Any notes in the People record show when someone calls. The comments box can be moved anywhere on the screen. I wish it had time stamp for tracking call times when clients call unexpectedly . It works well, overall,and I would recommend it to anyone needing to see or add comments on callers.",4,0,2.4.2,2013-03-23 05:48:46,,

Now I have my Xperia z it is Now possible. Thanks you have saved me there. Many thanks.,5,1,2.4.2,2013-03-19 07:25:26,,
