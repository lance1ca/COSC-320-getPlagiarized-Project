There's practically no story, just little messages that constantly pop up and annoyingly get in the way. ADN has messages (or a ""story"") too, but nowhere near as annoying. The games are different enough to play both, and there are things each one does better than the other. I like some things about the layout better in this one, and some things better in ADN. I feel that an official version, especially one that costs money, should be substantially better than a free version, not marginally better, if that. I can't even get myself to play through this one again because of the stupid pop ups every time I collect wood. They need to be moved to the bottom of the screen where they'd be out of the way. I also never figured out the point of the jewels. And supplies should be listed on each page (there's room to do so) or at least have a button to view them on each page, so you don't have to keep going back and forth so much. The concept and game itself are great, but the implementation needs work.",3,0,1.11,2018-10-07 06:44:09,,

about the game: it is an rpg text-base game (and minialist at that, there's 
no fancy graphic or any graphics at all, just your character, and the

It's a clicker game for an endless stream of upgrades followed by a mediocre and very small wilderness roguelike followed by a 30 second arcade sequence. I guess the atmosphere is well done and it's an interesting idea to put the genres together. But mostly what kept me going was wondering if the gameplay was going anywhere to justify all the accolades. It just doesn't and is never challenging.

Honeatly this being the ""official"" version I was hoping it'll have a much nicer interface and be easier to play.  The text log is put at the bottom of the screen, and 90% of the time it's covered by my fingers as I try to reach the buttons. It's awkward to read.   The back button is put at the top left side of the screen, which is awkward to reach with my right thumb (I'm right-handed).   The pop up text is good in that I know some things are happening; I don't read the log much because of its position. But it covers the buttons I'm trying to press. It interrupts my playing flow.  Overall this version of the game is just not very pleasing to play. I'm rather disappointed to be honest, especially since I think most of my grievances can be addressed by switching the text log and the buttons' position.   If you can play the browser version, just play that. It's free, and has a much nicer side-by-side interface.",3,0,1.11,2018-02-09 18:10:03,,

Also why the MC started calling the villagers slaves, there should be options for a better path such as the MC offering to kill or save people or to consider the villagers feelings and let them rest.

Visually, it would've been nice if the narrative stood out a bit more from gameplay feedback. Overview of supplies felt a bit too cluttered.   Unfortunately, the game crashed fairly often for me, especially during long excursions on dusty path.  Also, the 'secret' Dev commentary is incomplete; some of them stop abruptly, mid-sentence. Are these audio-files accessible online, so I can skip through the parts I've already heard?  A 'Take all' button would've been nice. While I understand limiting healing, having no out-of-combat heal-by-eating felt odd from an in-game character perspective.  While this may seem like a lot of criticism, it's because I really liked playing through this game, and just wished I would've been distracted a bit less so I could've focused more on the wonderful narrative.

Once you beat the game once, you unlock a cool developer commentary, that I loved. At first, elements of the game seem weird and out of place, but then I realized it all fit together into it's unique story. I found this looking for a text-based adventure game, like Zork. It's a button-pressing game, with no text commands. But it reminded me of what I liked about Zork. Except this game isn't impossible.

I'll admit I am a bit greedy and tend to enjoy a game and just move on to the next. However, this game is on a different level in my opinion. It has all my favorite elements, post-apocalyptic setting, mystery, text-based gameplay, choices that affect the storyline, and more.  Ultimately, my decision to rate this game was because of the 'Secrets' once the game has been beaten. I felt a genuine connection to the creators, builder, and wanderer.  I really enjoyed the game and am so grateful for Michael and Amir. This game was beautifully done - and I can not wait for your future endeavors!",5,4,1.11,2017-07-10 00:23:30,,

Anyway I felt compeled and had an urge to figure out what the game was about, so I bought it. MONEY WELL SPENT. The game takes you on an emotional experience and the plot gets thicker and thicker as you continue! If you find the intro to be boring, just get through it, trust me you will enjoy it!
