There are basically 12 different scenes directly from the Bob Books series.   There are four levels, each with a slightly more difficult task for the child to complete on each of the twelve scenes .   This app teaches consonants and short vowel sounds.   A perfect level for kids that are starting to learn letter sounds and who are starting to sound out words. My son seems to be enjoying it. .",5,3,1.0,2014-02-13 18:34:02,,
