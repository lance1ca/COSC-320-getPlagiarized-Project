The controls never get in to way of the game; excellent UI design. The music sounds stunning, even better than the DS version, and the higher resolution on phones make it a pleasure to play.  I also love to mention that no internet acces is required. Saves and quicksaves will always just work as they should regardless of connection. It's rare to see that these days.
