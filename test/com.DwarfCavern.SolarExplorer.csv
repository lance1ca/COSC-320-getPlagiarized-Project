The graphics, music and difficulty!(Which is like mission on phobos is like throwing the mobile lol) But I got a thing. When playing a mission in Phobos, if I set the rcs to safe setup, it breaks the physics during separation of the rocket. Make the lander upside down when is is attached to the rocket. When it is separated from the rocket, make the lander upside up. Also make only 3rd/4th stage of the rocket to the view. Then it is more realistic. Hope you receive my review :)I also like the the menu that says about the lander cuz that is quite funny XD. I support single person developers like you! Hope you make a developer team and more games! Really love this game:) And hope future games would have low cost cuz then you can use the things you used in making of this game!(I m from India and I also like Norway ;)",5,0,1.0.4,2021-02-04 21:58:10,,

Take old school moon lander games and modernize them with some twists. Love the atmosphere and feel to the game. I am just now past Mars and hoping you create more games in the future. Continue the story and the general ideas. You have a winner with this game. This should be a indie top hit right here.,5,22,1.0.4,2019-07-27 14:34:14,"Thank you so much! I can't describe how much this kind of support and feedback means to a single person developer :) There are future games in plan belonging to the same ""universe"" and of different genres :)",2019-07-27 14:53:06

Can you please take direct contact with me via the support email, and include a screenshot when and where it happens so that I am able to reproduce the issue and fix it? Thank you in advance :)",2019-07-27 02:37:10

I've only completed the Moon missions and some of Mars, but I feel I will thoroughly enjoy the rest. Con: Asteroids will sometimes be placed in horrible ways that completely block optimal trajectory. Idea: Another mode that involves launching the rockets, performing burns to alter orbital characteristics, etc. would be nice, possibly a future game idea.
