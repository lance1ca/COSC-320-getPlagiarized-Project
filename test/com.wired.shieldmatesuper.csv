Functionally you're not missing out on really anything if you stick to the free version, but supporting the creator for a well made app was a no brainier to me. My wife and I actually use it these days for Star Realms so I set up the default table to load our names, favorite colors, and starting life count of 50.",5,2,1.8.1,2020-06-27 04:30:11,,

I definantly reccomend this app to anyone who plays any form of magic. There's one bug I've noticed that would be awesome to be fixed though: if you have hide buttons by default enabled, then it won't let you go to the player customisation when click and holding on a players name.",5,2,1.8.0,2020-02-01 16:57:32,,

I would highly reccomend purchasing this edition and bring it to your next FNM. It helps you keep track of nearly anything you can think of in MTG (especially EDH) and all the themes you can choose from just help you immerse yourself in the game even more. The only thing is that I wish I could make a custom theme but with all the options, I'll be ok for now. KEEP UP THE GREAR WORK!!!",5,1,1.8.0,2019-12-23 13:58:26,,
