The game used to hide the navigation bar once the app started. Now the navigation bar remains and interfere with game plays.

I especially love that the extra pad colors are included at no cost. I have only played the standard version in real life, so I greatly appreciate the chance to try the extra variants. I find them a bit harder than the standard pad, my scores tend to be lower when playing them- which I like the harder difficulty! After so many plays, the only thing missing from this very extremely well done app is an undo button. There have been a couple times where after I have started crossing a section, I have realized a better spot. Which this isnt a problem if there is another space on the board, if you click there the X you started crossing will move and you can essentially 'do over' but as the game continues and you get down to the last few spaces, there many not be another potentional spot. And you cannot 'reset' within the same color block. So i often end up dividing the block up into multiple smaller 1 blocks, where starting from a different location may have left them in a group of 2 or 3 instead. My only nitpicky complaint. Otherwise it works extremely well. Scores have ranged from 5 to 39 across the many many games played, trying to break my record of 39 is quite difficult but I enjoy the challenge!",5,3,1.0.0,2018-08-26 12:12:01,Thank you for your feedback. Glad you like our app. You can always remove the last crosses by tapping on one of the selected dice. Hope this helps!,2018-08-26 12:34:57
