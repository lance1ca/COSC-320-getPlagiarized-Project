It's a hard game... but that is its charm I guess. A tip for new players: do hit and run tactics. And try to upgrade your drones and shields.",3,11,2.0.7,2020-11-16 15:01:40,,

Even so, i've spent no less than 25 or 30 hours playing this silly little game, with no end in sight. It has excellent controls (though the addition of a ""repair all ships"" button would not go amiss), lovely audio, a casually-paced RTS combat system (with the ability to pause and assign commands), can be put down and picked up on a moment's notice (it saves constantly, so there's no way around making a poor decision or dying an untimely death), and has both a 4-part campaign and an ""endless"" mode, where the 4 levels repeat until the player is eliminated. Unlock new ships via leveling up and collecting tokens which drop from alien ships now and then. (Tip: the campaign cannot be won on the first try - it requires using upgraded ships). Despite all the time i've spent on it, there are still 5 or 6 ships left to unlock. The only truly annoying bit now is the slow rate at which resources are gained, taking ages to afford a second/third ship or replace a lost one.

Some changes would make the game more enjoyable like not being limited to 3 capital ships and also having more access to a variety of ships and allies that stay with you. Instead of leaving after a couple of turns. You still be ganged upon and killed. 3rd comment. 3 ship limit has not changed. Still will be outnumbered and die fast in forever mode.,4,11,2.0.5,2019-01-03 01:52:35,Check out Kickstarter and Battlestation Harbinger there. A massive update with more races is coming!

keep the game playable and not something you play/beat do everything in one 
weekend and delete. Even on easy though, I bet I died 20 times on the first 
day, due to lack of metal/upgrade points on map, or whole fleets jumping on 
top of me with just my 1 ship. #2: If you are going to make us fight 
through hell to level up and unlock better ships, at least make them worth 
it please. After Assault ship, Armor, Shields and Speed seem to actually 
decrease on almost every ship. With the only thing that seems to increase 
is module and weapon mounts. Seriously, the higher up the ship, the more 
expensive and powerful it should become, not weaker. #3 The pay of for 
missions is very poor considering the effort for them. Especially the item 
retreival, you have to clear multiple sectors to get the items and then you 
just gain the ship as a wing man (Which barely has any armor or Shields) or 
a horrible pay off from stations. That all being said, I like this game, 
this is not a rant, just constructive criticism. I really enjoy the music a 
lot, props to the composer, gives me a Nostalgic Saturday Morning Cartoons 
feel.",3,1,2.0.5,2018-05-03 09:59:19,"Hi! Thank you for the feedback. When you get a bit further along in the levels the unlocked ships will start to be significantly more powerful in every way. Those first unlocks are a bit bad, this is true. Thanks!",2018-05-04 00:49:00

Rather than just, go here, pick this item up... take it there.  The perma death ads some pressure and tension but it can be very frustrating when your Faster Than Light drive gets jammed and you get ambushed and there is nowhere to go.   Some of the ships dont have the capability to self repair (with an item you buy or find) so it is even more frustrating when you get damaged and there is no where to repair for a while.   There are also some bugs in this game like when you pick a certain mission but there is also a 'escort ship' mission it will pick that regardless. As mentioned it is pretty simplistic so you dont have to be as quick to make commands as you would in most RTS games, but i think this may be more suitable for turnbased battles as it does feel a bit like you are just a bystander and there isnt really any quick dodging or anything like that.

Just a idea.  Now about controls, I gave this three stars and that's only because selecting my ships can be a bit hard some times would like to see some buttons added that will allow me to select one of my ships.

Being a paid game, there is no freemium element artificially slowing down gameplay. It is a nice change of pace and effectively turns it into a punchy ROGUE-LIKE.

Anyway to the real review, this game is hands down amazing, easily understandable GUI, gameplay, storage mechanics, and most importantly, the purchase mechanics, are well thought out. Now As far as gameplay goes, think of the movement of your fighter ships, but this time, you are given COMMAND of the ship, this ship can basically have a fleet maximum of 3 ships each carrying their own different weapon/drone bay slots (based on the ship you buy). Now given this, alot of things are available with out research (something i miss is the researching function) but... as it stands this game is great already. Now that its been updated with expansion thats on PC its in my opinion pretty much complete (i do hope for more drone additions and flagships though), Anyway all in all you cant go wrong getting this game. Extremely fun time killer, and the score boards are fairly fair (although i think they should be reset given highest scores are from initially when the game was first released making reaching those scores close to impossible)",5,3,1.5.0,2016-04-22 23:09:42,"Thank you so much for the awesome review commander!

I was not disappointed, either. Even before the last major update, there were a good variety of ships and weapons to pick and choose from. Now there are even more. This game is hard to put down.  However, one design choice in the game confuses me a little. When arming your ships, you do not have access to the entire human arsenal from the weapons purchasing screen. Some weapons can only be purchased through trade with allies or space stations you find in the game. I can understand only being able to obtain alien versions of weapons through trade or salvage, but as you play as the humans, why would you not have access to these weapons if you had the funds to purchase these expensive and powerful weapons, especially when they are labeled human weapons?

This is a game that receives regular updates and has real dedication from its Devs! There's so much to do! It's not a simple; select a ship, and then fly around doing a few missions. It's a select a ship ranging from a small carrier to a battleship and then your escorts range from scouts to heavy carriers. Then you need to collect some scrap, and parts to upgrade whatever main weapons systems, shields, or hardpoint defences you want to equip. Or even pick up some stock or partly upgraded ones along the way, trade with other fleets or ships and battlestations.  Something Id love to see (and i know its being done) is more ships. But I'd love to see something like a ""shipyard"". Something with maybe 3 Hangers for fighters/drones/bombers and possibly a ""Frigate Hanger"" where you can build Frigates (for example). something that packs a bigger punch than a small attack/defence craft. Maybe you can only have 1 shipyard and support a limited number of frigates that cost scrap to build. maybe just 1 main weapons slot per shipyard that has a large buff to shield generators, repair beams and teleporters, can equip a lot of hardpoints, and have very limited movement.",5,16,1.3.2,2016-01-19 10:33:42,,

There needs to be an easy way to distinguish the status of my own ships vs the enemy, perhaps a highlighter on the ""nameplate"" or a small bar at the top of the HUD that can be toggled. When we're overlapped and shields and hull are dropping fast, it's a guessing game who is about to die. It's led to more than a few frustrating moments. Also, it would be helpful to be able to see what modules are available to a ship before purchasing. Unless it's by design for some particular reason, I don't know why this would be left out.

Movement of the AI can make your game very difficult and they sometimes chase you down to your death! Specific targetting of ship systems and deploying drones are some of the features this game has.

The bigger ships are slow and turn slow like a real ship would. Fighters are fast and avoide the big guns but are nicely taken out by the support weapons/drones.
