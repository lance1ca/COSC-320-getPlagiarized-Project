It's probably personal, but for me it's the absolute best, as mercenaries and focus fill in parts I see as disadvantages of those games (the ""I want the effect but not want it in my deck"" and the ""what do I do with my spare change?"").  Perhaps I'm not as good at deck building, but to me the medium AI provides a nice 50/50 challenge, whereas the hard AI just beats me all but one time. To my own surprise, this game holds up pretty well with 3 and 4 players. It doesn't devolve into ""all defense and level up"". But make no mistake: that infinity shard isn't just a gimmick. It's tough to make it to level 30, but a valid strategy.  That said...not only is this a (IMHO) absolutely great game, but it's made by the team that made the race for the galaxy app. And it shows: the interface is slick, responsive and intuitive (hint: use the 'large text' option! :-) ) and overall a joy to play.
