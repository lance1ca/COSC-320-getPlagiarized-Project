I was put in a game with zero information, and had to figure some things out myself, when a few minutes later (that is, after a group of zombies attacked my base, I figured out how to create and move units, and uncovered two groups of zombies in nearby houses) and dialog comes up that teaches me how to move units. The dialog should've popped immediately as the game started, not as the first three groups of enemies have already killed my units. I kept playing for about half an hour, got tired of not knowing what I'm doing, and uninstalled.  While playing, I felt that the controls were very finicky: I'd tap on a unit and select the zombie next to it. I'd also appreciate information about the units, as in the first mission there are three (I think? It never really explained what to do) units I can make. The truck is obviously a truck, but I couldn't tell the difference between the two infantry units, so I just stuck with the less expensive one, since I also didn't know how to increase resource production (or even if that's possible).

Initially found the gameplay fun and original however was eventually let down by the extremely poor balancing.  After the first couple of levels the boosted resource start is pretty much required for even a fighting chance of reaching day 31 on even casual difficulty. Resources are frustratingly scare even with aggressive expansion.  Zombies scale over the course of a battle making unit upgrades essential to keep pace damagewise. However this causes repair costs to ramp up disproportionately to the survivability of your units which typically remain relatively squishy until max levelled.  This is made worse by the AI which requires constant babysitting to stop units blindly shooting at the closest enemy regardless of weapon type.  The enemy in contrast will make a beeline for your most valuable and fragile units, usually ignoring any defenders in the way. Whereas some of your units can miss, it seems enemy fire cannot be dodged which is unfortunate, since upgraded spitters in particular seem to have a habit of simply sniping out the RPG and tanks meant to stop them.",2,2,1.3.2,2017-05-07 14:12:26,,

(GAME DEVS! Make it so you can 'draw' the path that unit or units follow.) 3, the most costly, on the night city map, when I click on the police and get a scout I sometimes get a beginner instead which I don't need and it can cost the outcome of the level badly. Lease fix these bugs but over all I give it out of 10 (1= awful, 5=average, 10= legendery) I give it so far a 8 out of ten. Final notes: Would be cool to have some sort of story element.
