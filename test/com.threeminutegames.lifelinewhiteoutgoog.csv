The Original was by far my favorite, as it set a high standard narrowly reached by Lifeline: Silent Night. I enjoyed this game very much, but I'd be lying if I said this wasn't of lower quality.  There are moments where Adams is supposed to do a task that should warrant its own 'Adams is Busy' but instead gets overlooked. Something that should take five minutes or so is completed within the time it takes for the next text log to appear.  There were many moments in this game where I think improvements could have been made. It honestly feels like this game may have been slightly rushed. I hope more Lifeline game's continue to be published, especially further one's featuring Taylor, but try to remember it's not about the quantity, but the quality.

The reason I'm knocking stars off Whiteout is because of clumsy writing.  The story is quite good, but it's communicated in an inelegant way--this one needed a few more passes through the revision machine before release.  I really hope the quality of writing returns to its former standard before we meet Taylor and Arika again, as we've been promised.  I'm also not crazy about how much shorter response times are in this game.  I much preferred the delayed gratification element of the first three.  MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW.  Additionally, Adams' story does not connect to the previous installations in the series the way I was hoping and expecting.  It appears unrelated.  No clever references to previous events, no small clues that we're witnessing another chapter of the same story unfold.  There is simply nothing green here.  Bottom line:  I'm disappointed.  If previous games hadn't been so excellent, I would probably be giving this one four stars.
