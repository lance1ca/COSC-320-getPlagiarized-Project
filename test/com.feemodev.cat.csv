Although, I can't seem to find Freckle and Dotty :(",5,25,2.5,2019-09-12 20:26:24,"hello!

yes Freckle and Dotty only appears on the Day 2,
you must talk with them on that day, or they disappears.

(I guess rainy day was too harsh for the baby kitty.)

thank you for playing :)",2019-09-13 06:13:24

Good premise, has potential, but uninstalled after 15 minutes because I could only do one or two things before I had to rest again. Also, watching the mom get hit by a car in the first cut scene was absolutely atrocious. Why?? It wasn't necessary. At all.",3,10,,2019-09-10 22:43:38,"Hi, 

1).please upgrade your house,
(your health, hunger, hp recovery, moving speed increase )

2.) theres a NPC who gives canned food every day,  she helps you to survive.

3.) and yes the scene was necessary :)
I can't tell you because it's a spoiler but,
you'll know after you play all the endings. 

thank you for leaving us comment.",2019-09-11 00:08:38
