Although I'm completely satisfied with the App, there is still some scope for improvement: 1. The Bell sometimes is too loud and it would be great if could have control for that. 2. If you change the Tempo of the Tabla (Ex: Vilambit to Drut) it starts from Sam again. 3. The response time for Table is slow. It takes around a sec for the Tabla to stop if you press the stop button. This delay could be reduced. 4. If the App runs in background, it sometimes causes crack in sound. 5. Tanpura could be greatly improved. I have seen better applications. 6. There can be a Tihayi while stopping the Tala.",5,30,2.2.0,2018-10-19 23:54:28,"Hi Sanket, thanks for your appreciation and detailed review.

i m practising with real Tabla. So, thanks a ton for putting these real 
thekas! Saving different sessions is a big help. I can set my vilambit in 1 
and drut theka in another. And while singing, its just one switch to start 
the drut. Bravo! I loved all thekas overall. I just wish Deepchandi 
(vilambit) should have been better. Tilwada is played in Northern style... 
there should be ""kat-dhin-dha"" version. Swarmandal is amazing too. There 
should b a feature to customise other ragas though. About tanpura, one 
great musician once said that the Pancham is little flat. Please check it. 
Also, if possible, add manual fine tuning for the first string. If 
possible, add taar Saa in the first string options. Dual tanpura will 
obviously be appreciated. Thank you!",4,0,2.2.0,2018-05-20 22:18:30,"Hi, thanks for your review and appreciation.

Either Add some more Raga or give an option to manually set the notes of ""swar mandal"" .For Ex- If I want to sing ""Ahir Bhairav"" i cannot set swar mandal on any other Raga nor would it give a feel if i set it as ""All"".  3.

The presets is all that you get which are too few.  * No way to tune individual tanpura strings. * The UI needs big improvement.

The new version feels more professional to use.   If possible then future additions -  I would suggest to more Raagas and intstruments to play the Nagma and the Metronome feature.   All in all I am very satisfied with the new version of the App in terms of features, usability and especially commitment from iShala team.
