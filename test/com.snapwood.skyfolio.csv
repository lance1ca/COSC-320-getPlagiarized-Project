Unlike the Sydrive app, there is a slide show feature, which can be set to work automatically when the app is activated.  Unlike the Skydrive app, as soon as you activate Portfolio, full size images are still there instantly, so you do not have to wait for downloads, as is the case with Skydrive.  It is very easy to create new albums/folders for your images, and to move them from one to the other.  Any changes you make to Skydrive via your PC - such as uploading, deleting etc. - will not reflect on Portfolio until you next charge your phone.  Skydrive on the other hand probably refreshes changes when activated, but to have all the photos full size, you may have to wait half an hour. However, a selected thumbnail instantly changes to full size, - but all the other images also become full size in the background - very very slowly. You can slide photos across the screen despite black gaps waiting for the full size transformation to take place. Portfolio slideshows seem to mix the contents of all albums, -  which is unfortunate.",5,2,2.3.12,2012-09-05 02:23:57,,

Speed is decent but slower than Microsoft Skydrive for iOS, Win8, Mango.  Two problems for me:  1) It downloads low resolution pictures for screen with resolution less than 1280x720.  No problem for my Transformer but 10.1"" panel with 1024x768 only download low resolution picture.  7"" panel with 1024x600 screen probably suffers by the same glitch.    2) Slideshow only cycles thru pictures in current folder but excludes sub-folders.   If you are looking for a Skydrive app for photo, this is the best at the moment.  Having said that, I think you will get better result by using Foldersync Lite (Free) to sync your Skydrive to local folder, then use a dedicate Slideshow app like Free Photo Slide to view your pictures.",3,2,2.3.11,2012-08-08 21:15:48,,
