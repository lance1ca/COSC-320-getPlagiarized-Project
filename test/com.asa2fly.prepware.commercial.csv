I just took the Commercial Airplane written test and most of the questions I was asked weren't in this app. Of the ones that were at least similar, most had been rewritten so that the answers were different. Even the diagrams in the test supplement were different, and those are public information. I recommend going elsewhere for your test prep. Shepard worked great for my Instrument written.

Additionally. I wish there was a way to save your test scores so you can see trends of improvement. Often I accidentally bump the back button when checking my mistakes on the grade portion of a test and there is no going back. Almost a waste of time taking a 100 question test. Still love how much it helps me because getting 75% on this app leads to me grtti by 80% and up on the actual written exams.,4,3,1.25.0,2018-04-09 10:23:04,,

It seems too simple in some aspects and needs some control. Give a study mode that lets you practice multiple categories and lets you pick how many questions to do in a session.,4,1,1.221,2017-04-24 20:56:10,,
