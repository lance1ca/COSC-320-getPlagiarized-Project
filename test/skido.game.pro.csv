But I can only give v1.1 three stars owing to numerous bugs and design issues. TOP BUGS (1) When playing cards, they can get 'stuck' in odd positions and unplayable; forcing you to have to play a different card. (2) Frequent network dropouts to game server, possibly due to relative age of my HTC Desire. But I'd pay the $4.99 all over again to play with friends and fos alike online.",3,0,1.1,2021-01-01 08:12:50,,

Not good if you have to play again with the online. I download the latest version a few days ago and now I'm not happy with the version plus I paid for the old version and this one after playing a few days. Sry would like my money back.,2,1,1.1,2020-12-11 10:57:00,,

Game is glitching out. Either one gets the white screen of death or your cards are disappearing. Games with 25+ cards are unplayable since it's impossible to close the app and join the same game.

I paid for ads but opened to be blasted with ads. Telling me about the new app they released. I choose to buy it due to the fact I couldn't remove ads on that version. What I paid for was the exact same product but laggy as all hell. I should have got the game free or been allowed to keep the old version without ads. Kinda shallow to undo my ad free purchase and give me nothing in return.,2,8,1.1,2020-09-26 18:04:11,,
