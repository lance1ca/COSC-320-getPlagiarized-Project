the app is very convenient. This app packs a lot of punch and neat ideas. 
In my top 5 hue apps. One thing that needs improvement however is the color 
cycler. It seems very iregular, not a steady flow like most other apps. 
Sometimes it just seems to stop for a bit then starts again. Would also be 
great if you could adjust individual lights colors and brightness after 
selecting a photo to tweak it. With that being said, it's well worth the 
price of entry so I am rating it 5 stars. EDIT: Developer sorted out the 
color cycling issue, it's perfect now.",5,0,1.1.5.2,2018-06-19 22:13:26,"Hi John, thanks for the review. UPDATE: The cycling animations now work correctly with latest app update.
