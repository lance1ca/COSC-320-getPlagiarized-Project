I wanted something that would just copy the raw photos, without modification, into my Dropbox so that I could then manage them on my Desktop machine easily. dbFolio does exactly that, and it gives me lots of ways to manage when it does its uploading.   In general, I'm very happy with all of the *Folio products from Snapwood. For example, PicFolio is a much better uploader than the native Android Picasa Uploader because it is much more robust to network failures, and I have lots of batch editing options. Great products from Snapwood. Well worth the $2.50 to $3 per app.",5,0,2.2.4,2013-05-26 23:09:52,,

So account (A) has 20 pics when you switch to account (B) it says 20 pics also though there are many more.  You open account (B) and it shows account (A) pics.  A refresh avoids this and to me nothing but should be fixed,5,0,2.2.4,2013-05-21 22:06:35,,

The original Dropbox app isn't bad but you (currently) have to manually choose which photos you want to save locally for offline access. This app can be set up to always open at the ""photos"" folder or root folder. I have it set up to go directly to the Photo folder and download everything in that folder (automatically only on wifi while charging). The slideshow view in this app is cleaner as you can hide any overlay (image title, share/delete icons etc) from appearing accidentally (via single/double tap) as it would with the official app.  That overlay is useful for myself to perform actions but I don't want it to be visible while I show off my images.  This clean simple interface solves that ""you're doing it wrong"" frustration when you hand your tablet to someone else to see a photo album.  I have used the Flickr version of this app too which is virtually identical and just as useful.",5,0,2.2.2,2013-04-02 08:30:51,,

Haven't tried the auto upload feature because allshareplay does that already. but it's a nice simple gallery for dropbox.
