I swear, i rarely ever get past the second or third boss when my build is absolutely broken and theres 100% efficiency with my cards and how they work together.

Since the latest ""Abyss"" update, the previous Season Pass which will unlock the Assassin character at Level 50 was gone, and replaced with another pass which we need to BUY AGAIN. Also, the reason why I quit this game is because I wanted to save my profile to the cloud using the ""Save Profile"" function, but then I accidentally clicked ""Restore Profile"", and WITHOUT a confirmation, my profile was rolled back to a point where I would have to play for more than 30 continuous hours just to be back where I was. Also, the ""Abyss"" mode is too difficult because of the ""Sanity"" feature, where having less than 60% Sanity gives the ""Madness"" debuff feature, which although says that the Madness card has the 30% chance to be drawn, it usually filled my entire deck of 5 cards (stastically 0.243% chance to occur).

I have a cool suggestion for a character which could be calld chameleon or the copier so every attack a enemy does he can do .passive can be each attack adds one poison.,5,0,1.1.9,2019-07-13 22:20:47,,
