Used it on the S7 which I bought in 2017. And now on the S8+. I love this app. The inbuilt Blue light filter on the Samsung phones doesn't stand a chance against Twilight.  I have 2 problems with it though.   1. When Nougat rolled out to my S7 I was elated when I found that I could add a Twilight button to my shortcuts in the notification shade. But, the button just wouldn't work like all the other shortcuts. (even after going deep in to accessibility settings and pro settings in the Twilight app itself. Some of the toggles have to be turned on in a certain sequence for it to work like a regular button)   2. This one is new. After I bought the S8+. As Samsung has opted to remove the physical home button and capacitive keys and switched to on screen keys Twilight can't dim the bottom part of the screen occupied by these keys. And the dimming is very uneven on the rest of the screen causing the whole screen to look very ugly.   I hope the team can fix these issues.   Thanks a lot guys for the awesome apps.
