The speed adjuster doesn't adjust and is glitchy. It's like the tortoise is the hare and the hare is the tortoise. I want a refund!,1,0,1.0 Pro,2021-01-07 16:38:55,,

I bought this app to help me build a online course. It does the job but I feel like for the price it definitely could be a little less buggy and I also think the design could be better. I am using an Android phone so that may be the reason it is a bit buggy. I noticed that when I copy a script from my word processor on my phone and then go back to the app it always freezes. I also think the speed and the font control should both be sliders at the bottom.,3,2,1.0 Pro,2020-12-01 09:19:47,,

None of the remote capabilities of the other versions. Only reason I downloaded it was for the remote control option to go along with tablet version. Useless.,1,5,1.0 Pro,2020-11-09 11:41:39,,

The Android version is missing little things that the iOS version has. The speed of the script scrolling cannot be adjusted in the same manner as the iOS version and it glitches out 100% of the attempts to use it. There countdown feature is missing in the Android version. Creating a ticket with the ""help"" feature is aggravating and is unproductive. This is a great app in the iOS environment, and an poor port to Android.",1,6,1.0 Pro,2020-10-21 16:41:14,,

The speed difference between 20 and 19 is absolutely insane. At speed 20 I'm galloping away and tripping over my words. But at speed 19 I'm pausing for long gaps between sentences. Why on earth do you have so little granularity on the speed control??????? If you can't figure out how to implement better granularity why don't you support a remote control????? Why does the application hang everytime I try to make an edit on a file??? Refund requested.,1,2,1.0 Pro,2020-10-17 11:55:54,,

And this should be too, I see it allows use of remote control, which is great, and it also can film you as you read which is the best, BUT where is the feature that lets you squash all your text to the side of the screen near your camera, so you are looking right at the camera as you read? Is this key feature really missing? Or am I looking in the wrong place? Thanks!",3,8,1.0 Pro,2020-06-25 18:25:11,"Hi Tamhas, thanks for your support! The feature you mention isn't missing as it's not really part of Teleprompter Premium. It's the defining feature of our other product Video Teleprompter on iOS. Teleprompter Premium is designed more as a professional studio or stage Teleprompter. Hopefully that clarifies in some way! ðŸ™‚",2020-06-26 04:14:53
