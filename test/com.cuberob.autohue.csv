Sorry to hear your missing those features, they are however also not mentioned in the app description.

Pick a colour and you're given a hexadecimal value. That means you can't choose saturation and brightness. Only way to do that is type that whole like yourself.

Also works faster when I am using pebbletasker as opposed to Lampshade.

Add a way to set the ""transitiontime"" parameter which controls fading/etc, we can work around this with custom JSON but that defeats the purpose of the nice UI. 2. Consider fixing the ""Succes"" spelling as shown in the screenshots.
