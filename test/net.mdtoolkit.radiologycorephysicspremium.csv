Would be 5 stars but the UI is terrible. I think it is better with the iPhone. Please program it so that we can see our progress and do unused questions or at least create one test with all the questions and not lose progress when you open another app. Thank you!,4,0,4.0,2021-01-30 08:01:32,,

Questions are very relevant and hit the important stuff repeatedly. Some typos and quirks with the app, but well worth the $10 for the CORE.  Wish there was a way to keep track of the questions you've done, or start a set with just unanswered questions.  Edit: Passed the CORE! Looks like it works",5,1,4.0,2018-08-06 18:58:40,,

landscape. There are too many first order questions, such as ""what is this 
artifact"", which doesn't really test your understanding of the physics 
principles, only your ability to identify the abnormality. Many of the 
questions are word for word identical to those from the Physics 300 app 
with identical explanations. Maybe worth it if these questions were modeled 
after the questions on the actual exam.",2,1,4.0,2018-05-04 07:13:14,,
