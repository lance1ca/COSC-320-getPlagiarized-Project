There seems to be a bug though. When I select a +1 in the passive phase it only lets me fill in the third row for a yellow die. I thought you could only choose gray spots for yellow but even with the number changer it would only let me put a number in the third row. Definitely was not in the third roll either. I was in the passive phase.... There is a reply to this review and I am aware of that rule. It was letting me fill in ANY box in the third row, not just the gray squares.",4,3,1.2.2,2020-11-19 12:44:50,"Hi Antonio, in yellow you can only check the gray squares in the passiv move (not I / II / II). Its the right implementation double check the rules. Many thanks for the good rating and I hope you enjoy a lot of games",2020-11-19 12:35:55
