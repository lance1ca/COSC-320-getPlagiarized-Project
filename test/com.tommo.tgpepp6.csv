Too bad the audio quality can't be updated. It can be a bit grating. Also 1 star cause this app randomly downloads updates every few months or so. It's a bit suspicious. Maybe some bug?,1,4,1.1.0,2020-05-27 10:42:58,,

I love Putt Putt. Great childhood flashback haha. I just wish they had an option to skip through all the talking like the original game used to. Takes forever when you have to listen to everyone and you can't get the game played as quickly as the original. This would be a fantastic feature to add!,5,7,1.1.0,2017-02-28 00:58:26,,

Keeps saying checking license. My son is impatient. He loves putt putt as much as I did when I was kid. I don't want to refund and have it charge my card again just to get it to work. And it's on wifi. Only thing on wifi so it shouldn't take 2 hours to load. Other putt putt games didn't take this long to load. Very not pleased.,1,5,1.1.0,2016-03-02 13:53:58,,
