I really enjoyed the depth of this game compared to the others. The story, told in snapshots of time, developed strong characters and a narrative that I wanted to understand. Similarly to Birthday, the game emotes uneasiness, a feeling of dread and mystery without being obtuse. That is impressive considering that there is little animation or dialogue. By the end, I didn't want to leave these characters and the after game surprise was a perfect gift. Cons:. Gameplay. This is the first game where the developers use the scroll right/left control. I did not have a smooth experience with this method of movement on my mobile device. I had to strain my eyes to view some of the puzzles and there were times that I simply could not see what I needed to see. The puzzles were just as difficult and logical as the other games in the series. I appreciated that most of the multi-step puzzles kept the progress you made as you completed steps outside of the actual puzzle to solve.

Atmosphere and the feel is very strong. I guess cus its very original. There is no other game ive played that is like this. There's a sense of strange mystery going on that you cant put your finger on. It intrigues me. I can't imagine most kids liking this game and understanding it. I could be wrong. But seems very adult oriented. I like that. I also like the fact that the devs have had... And still have a vision.. I see a potentially huge future for this project. Kudos. :),5,9,1.2,2018-02-22 21:11:29,,

Once you play through this series,  you too will start thinking in ""Cube Escape's"" quirky logic, which absolutely I love! The graphics are simple but extremely creative. They begin to lend a sense of familiarity to each scene without being repetitive, while also allowing the developers to focus on game play and advancement of the story line. I can't recommend this series enough. I would also like to add, to their credit, that they never ask for ANY permissions on your device and there are no in app purchases.

I downloaded the game at 11am this morning. Discovered a glitch at 11.11am and emailed about it, they responded almost immediately with some questions and suggestions. Still didn't work so emailed back. They let me know they were looking into it and by 1.30pm they let me know an update was available. Which has fixed it. Some other games developers could really do with taking  notice of how to treat customers. Amazing.",5,10,1.1.2,2016-10-20 05:39:59,,
