The pixel graphics seem detailed and look great, especially on spell and attack visual effects. Gameplay has the perfect mix of challenging, varied and engaging. It's a no-nonsense offline singleplayer game. However, the lack of support ruins this otherwise perfect dungeon crawler on mobile. This game is FAR outdated compared to its PC port. Lots of features are missing, and the dev seems to not be interested in doing anything about that anymore. Gameplay and classes here feel inferior compared to the updated versions. There seems to be NO CLOUD-SAVES as well, which is a huge bummer for a singleplayer game. That being said, I really can't recommend getting a game that's dead now and lacks cloud saving support, unless you're sticking to a single phone your whole life then yes, this is most definitely worth the buy.

Honestly. This is, BY FAR, the best game I've played on android.   The controls are even more tight and responsive than they already were in its predecessor, Mage Gauntlet. Combat is very Dark Souls-esque, forcing you to learn enemy's attack patterns and strike/dodge/block at appropriate times, and punishing the impatient and reckless player.   The soundtrack is a masterpiece, coating the game in a thick layer of atmosphere I didn't know was possible for a mobile game. This is further bolstered by the little pieces of story you can encounter in the procedurally generated levels, which also serve to make them feel not as such. Each character also has their own unique and interesting backstory that is told piece by piece as you progress through the dungeons.   The replay value is endless. Collecting hats is extremely satisfying, and the roster of 6 characters each has their own persistent skills/perks that can be upgraded in-between playthroughs to give a sense of progression alongside the permadeath aspect.   The graphics and spritework are masterfully done, further adding to the atmosphere and making each level and environment a joy to navigate through, with things like destructible furniture/objects and various physics techniques.  I can confidently say that this game is worth every penny I paid for it and more, and definitely holds the title of #1 android game right now. Do yourself a huge favour and add this one to your collection.",5,0,1.32.1,2017-07-29 08:10:46,,

They charge at you, oops you missed because heir movement is diagonal, your attacks only work in 4 directions, what's that? They are above yo oops you are gonna turn and fire behind you instead. Died way too many times to the controls turning the wrong way, both in proswipe and analog. Other than that, an awesome game. Just needs tighter control scheme for those of us not using a game pad.  Update: The gold cost of upgrades vs gold gained really starts to get WAAAY too far apart. I'm only getting about 200ish per run and completing a couple of floors before dying to increasingly difficult enemies and my costs to upgrade are running into the thousands and two thousands requiring several runs in order to gain enough bonus damage and health to survive certain mechanics that are impossible due to sheer enemy numbers. I would like to see either a character stat boost, a reduction in the amount of creatures in screen, especially mama slimes, because you can get swarmed with infinite slimes but yet they are really hard to kill before they spawn a bunch, especially with the yellow slimes that you need to focus first, or a large increase in gold per run.",3,1,1.32.1,2017-04-20 12:55:47,,

Procedurally generated, fun,  big game, hats, diverse characters and a variety of ways to play. The only downside, that still doesn't warrant 4 stars is that some of the characters (adventurer) and upgrades (various) are vastly underpowered. Picking up some upgrade will literally hinder your character (cultist mostly), or offer negligible bonuses, while others are clear upgrades.
