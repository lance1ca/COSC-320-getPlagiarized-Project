The choice of fonts, the layout of the watchface, the seconds hand moving around the face, are all done with good taste in my opinion. We can customize colours and complications and that is it. I wish we had more options for ambient mode (what to show and how dim). Update: After a few days of using this watchface, my Fossil Gen 3 battery only lasted one day... by late afternoon I would be on battery saver. With A/D watchface I recharge my watch every 2 days. So, I really like the look of this watchface (material style), but stopped using it because of high battery usage.",4,1,1.1.1,2019-10-08 04:54:39,,

Somehow after resetting my watch I could not reinstall this warchface anymore.  The play store on my mobile told me that I do not have any compatible devices. The play store in the browser told me, that the app is already installed. Trying to reinstall it on my Fossil Full Guard resulted in an unknown error.  I contacted the developer on a Sunday evening and I got a reply within an hour telling me that I should try to reinstall the app via the play store on the watch... Well played Blueiceshard, that worked, thanks!!!  Kudos to the developer, nothing to Google...",5,1,1.1.1,2019-03-10 15:13:28,,

Skip the rest use this. I can't say recommend this enough.  Suggestions for improvement:  1. Open the agenda when the user taps on the date (currently a tap there goes nowhere)  2. Add an option to center the time. Currently off-center because of the seconds.  3. Add an option to display the battery level in the ring where the seconds are currently displayed.  But as it stands without these (minor) suggestions, it's still the best watchface hands down.",5,6,1.1.1,2019-01-10 08:11:59,,

The time position in always-on mode slightly changes to prevent screen burn-in on AMOLED displays. 

UPDATE: With the new update, the position is a bit adjusted. The time indicator should not touch the Do not disturb icon now.",2018-09-07 15:26:51
