Kingdom Builder is a great game, but considering the competition, this app feels very behind the times. The good: The AI is great! The bad: The user interface is clunky to use and doesn't look very polished. It's difficult to swipe down the Kingdom Cards because they're up at the very top of the screen, where you also have to swipe down for your settings on an Android phone. There is also a comically tiny ""close window"" button up there, that can also be hard to tap. Then, when the ""score"" window comes up, it's even worse.  An ""undo"" button should be added, for if you accidentally tap the wrong hex (which is easy to do while zooming in/out, which you have to do constantly.) In a throwback to the days of NES, there doesn't appear to be a way to ""save"" your game and return to it later, if the app shuts down for any reason. The multiplayer feature is poorly documented.     That said, I'll keep the app and continue to play it, because I like the game and the app is at least usable.
