Algunos finales son sorprendentes e inesperados. Otros son fáciles y entrenidos de conseguir. Muchos los ves venir, pero echas horas buscando la forma de alcanzarlos. El mapa es lo suficientemente pequeño como para memorizarlo, pero lo suficientemente grande para que te tires un rato tratando de recordar dónde estaba aquel rincón recóndito que te encontraste por casualidad o dónde estaba el pasaje secreto que te lleva a donde quieres ir. Los mandos son muy cómodos. Me encanta que hayan hecho una versión para Android y poder jugar en cualquier parte (nunca sabes dónde te va a venir la inspiración para matar al Dark Lord).
