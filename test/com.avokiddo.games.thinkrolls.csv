Both my children aged almost 5 and 7 love the little characters in this app and it's very well done. The puzzles start very simple but are not boring so the children remain interested. It's nice to have an app that makes them think whilst having fun. My daughter hasn't struggled with any of the levels yet, so don't know the full extent of the challenge it will pose, but both children love it. My only suggestion to the developer is that currently if you go out of where you are and then go back in, it appears the character your character is following may have changed. My son is high functioning autistic (aspergers) and was following the little nurse, but when he exited and went back it appeared he was following another character. It was difficult for him because in his mind he hadn't reached the nurse yet so this was unfinished. This caused some distress and needed explaining. If you could make it that you follow the same character until you've caught them regardless of whether you come out of that chapter and then re-enter it, that would be a good update (at least in our house!) That said both my autistic and non-autistic children love this game and can both play so huge kudos to you.",5,0,,2018-08-23 01:47:46,,
