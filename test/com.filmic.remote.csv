The only missing things is that we can not view our videos via filmic remote app. We have to switch back to original phone to view the videos. It would be perfect if we can see what we filmed directly via Filmic remote without switching back to the original phone. Anyway thanks for turning my phone into professional camera!!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",4,0,1.1,2021-02-09 18:10:02,,

Then I got it to work on two android devices but the wrong way round and now can't download it on the other device as it says already purchased And can't now refund Stupid stupid thing.
