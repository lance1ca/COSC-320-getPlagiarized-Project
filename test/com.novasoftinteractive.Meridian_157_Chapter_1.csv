Decent amount of content for the price. Puzzles were good; a few were on the difficult side, so be aware that this is going to be a challenge. A couple of them i didnt even understand even after solving them with the hints. Good thing that hints were built in. Only real negative is that the art is very detailed, and many times it was not clear what you could interact with without a lot of random clicks. A visible hotspot inficator would be a needed improvement.",4,14,1.1.3,2020-06-24 05:01:13,,
