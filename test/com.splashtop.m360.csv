The app works much better than some of the others.   Found that some of the others got stuck every now and then or the playback was jittery.  With this app playback is absolutely smooth over our 5G WiFi. The app is rather simple and doesnt allow for many settings to be changed - which I appreciate. As long as I can set the Name under which it comes up on the network - thats all I require.  If I had a wish it would be that it starts automatically with the telly. Other than that.
