So it's a bit unfeasible for arcade collections. - Sometimes game matching is not great, specially for arcade games. - Has a few Retroarch cores missing - This is the most annoying for me: when I remove a game from the console database, it throws me to the top of the library, making batch game removal really tedious and annoying. And sometimes when scrolling it also shoots me back up. - Doesn't have much customization options when it comes to layout selection or even starting the app when the system boots.

I currently have a 512GB microSD card in my tablet with a couple thousand games and Reset found them all. I only had to add box art for a couple NeoGeo roms I had which easily was fixed when i changed the name of the rom to the correct spelling for the scraper to work. Systems I am currently using and have tested and can say works perfectly are : Full romsets for 3 different MAME/Arcade versions (mame 0160, 2003 and FBA), NeoGeo, Super Nintendo, Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Sega 32X, Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, Nintendo Game Cube, Turbo Graphix 16, Sony PSP, Sony Playstation 1, and Panasonic 3DO. My only wish or hope is that right now you can change individual roms artwork to the boxart, boxart 3d, cartridge etc, but you have to do them all individually. I wish there was a way i could change the entire collection to show the 3D boxart , or all the medium (cardridge, CD, etc) right now it defaults to Boxart, which is totally fine and looks great, it just would be nice if we could change them all if we wanted to. Also there aren't clear instructions anywhere that I could find on how to scrape again for new artwork etc. I was able to add new artwork by choosing a folder that contained it on my device.

The only suggestion I would have at this point is to allow L1 and R1 to scroll to the next/previous letter.
