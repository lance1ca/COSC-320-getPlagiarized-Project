Here's why I'm docking it 3 stars, I've chose to just list a couple of the biggest problems because these are really bad, but there's a few other minor ones that I'm not going to write up. There is a setting to make the gameplay instant so you would seemingly not see any animation, in theory this would enable you to easily hop from game to game and play your turn. However, this is just poorly implemented and/or phrased in the settings, its supposed to be instant, however.. it still goes through 4-12 seconds of animation PER PLAYER when you hop in the game, and it RE-does that if you go out prior to your turn and come back in, it'll replay EVERYONE. This is absolutely infuriating for many reasons, one is that it still runs the turn timer on you while its doing all that nonsense 20 seconds of animation, so if you're doing a super blitz game speed it really limits you hopping out into other games in between turns. The other issue that is very much in parallel with the one I mention above the is poor/inconsistent/glitchy app connectivity, I'm sitting idle in my chair on a fiber WIFI connection and probably 20% or so of times when I am sitting in the same game waiting for players to take their turns, it just fails to load randomly, but that's just not ok because there is no visual indicator that you're not in sync with the game. So now I've gotten in the habit of just reloading the entire app every player to make sure I'm not running down my own clock thinking I'm waiting for someone else. I've probably had this happen in 20-25 games where I've got timed out when I was thinking I was waiting for someone else.. I highly doubt they're going to fix these things if they haven't already. I still play the game because I just sit and reload the entire app between every single move, but that requires so much more effort than it should.",2,16,2.7.4,2020-07-20 09:13:02,,

There were some really good ones, but after several games I was not playing them any longer, because they were getting too easy or too predictable or I was not excited at all. Through the Ages is not 4X game, because you have no map. You may not eXplore and eXpand, but you definitely may eXploit and eXtermine your opponents. It is a digital version of card based board game, but it is suprisingly (I was surprised) playable, enjoyable and amazingly replayable. One strategy is just not enough, each game is different and you need to be able adapt otherwise you are not going to win. You may play custom games and tricky challenges against well-programmed AIs, or you may try to beat human opponents in online games. You may also participate in championships.

The tutorial is fantastic, the bookkeeping tips are tremendously helpful, the solo challenges are *amazing*, and the asynchronous online play is fast and seamless.   I agree with others that AI bots in online matches would be great (which seems doable since AI can already take over for a player who times out), but what I'd really love to see is Online Challenges!

I just wish it was more customizable. I'd love to play the longer eras or immortal leaders with multiple people, for instance. One issue is with resignations. You could be behind in culture, you then decide to throw everything into a War Over Culture for a Hail Mary attempt to win the game, or at least get second place. Then out of spite the player resigns, and you get a measly 7 culture. From a strategical point of view you played brilliantly for the last shot at victory, but it's punished all because you declared war on a player who isn't tenacious. I think it'd be fairer for it to take one full turn to resign. In this scenario, when a player resigns, the AI takes over. Then in the politics phase of the next turn the player is fully eliminated from the game.

The AI is one of, if not the, best I've encountered in a digital boardgame and easily feel more challenging than a lot of the human players online. Great multi player with plenty of options for everything between very quick and very slow games. If I tire of multi player or the vanilla experience the challenges in the game should keep me entertained for countless hours as well. For a mobile app the price is high, but the value is ridiculous. I've played the digital version 10 times more in a week than I've had opportunity to play the original board game in two years.   Two issues, one major and two minor. On my phone the game crashes quite a bit, fortunately only on startup and when trying to write messages. This gets annoying quickly. As for writing messages the keyboard stops responding at times and I need to restart the app to get the keyboard to show up. Thirdly I feel the game could be a bit more performance optimized - it's easily the game that draws battery the fastest on my phone, more so than a few 3d games and more action oriented titles. That in combination with the insanely addictive multiplayer has given me ever so slight battery problems for the first time since I changed to my latest phone (which I picked a lot for the great battery).  As for improvements I would love a proper ELO (or similar) ranking system in multiplayer. The current system mainly tells you how many games any one player has played, but even losing every game could take you to level 50. The ability to spectate games, while not essential, would be fun as well. I'm not experienced enough to play with a lot of the more experienced players, but spectating to get more feel for their strategies would be fun.",5,0,1.5.4,2018-02-01 00:04:59,"Hello Lars,

thank you for your review and also for the advice. Most of them we already have on our list of features. So I can promise that we will implement into our game through upcoming updates. This also contains the issue which we will fix.

For anyone out there on T-MOBILE or a service like project Fi that uses T-Mobile you're going to have issues getting it to work online via cell data. This is because T-Mobile uses IPV6 and this game doesn't work with that. I got around this by finally setting up my VPN on my phone. I use private internet access which only uses IPV4. You could probably do the same for free by setting up a VPN at home through your computer. Its a little hassle but there is a way to make it work.   Other than that the game is great. In particular I love the multiple options on how to play online. Its super that so many online board games use asynchronous but sometimes I've got the time and the will to play a faster game that is live and I love that this game has those options.,5,2,1.3.2,2017-12-11 10:57:33,,
