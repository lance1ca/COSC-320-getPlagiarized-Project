The developer has added pinh to zoom which makes the tiny tiles much easier to see, so added a star. I still wish there was an outline/highlight option for tiles instead of the shaking movement which makes me a little dizzy when trying to pick and match. Boardgamearena does this highlight stuff nicely. This app is very unusual because even though it has portrait and landscape mode, it chooses this based on your device and there seems to be no way to change. But not horrible, just odd",4,12,1.1.0,2020-06-16 08:56:36,"Hello, sorry for the inconvenience.
