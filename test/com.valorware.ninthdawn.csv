The map is vast and open world which is great! But there is no zoom in option, or any map option for thay matter - so it's extremely difficult to really see where you are. When you open the map, it just shows the whole thing with place names and nothing else so it's almost useless. The small map on the top left is okay but again, really difficult to truly see where you are and what each building is.

Exploration is suppossed to be the main focus, but exploring the world isn't rewarding. The interface for combat is stunningly bad, to the point that any enemy that's not a complete pushover is an exercise in frustration. Meanwhile, loot is randomized and class-restricted, meaning 70-90% of what you find is useless except to sell for gold. So the game soon becomes a slog, and the lack of basic player conveniences like fast travel doesn't help. The last straw is the dungeons; overlong, confusing, and packed with absurdly hard foes, they soon try the patience of even the most obsessive rpg fan. At least the developer avoided ads and pay-to-win shenanigans. Unfortunately, that noble decision doesn't make the game fun.",1,1,1.92,2017-09-30 13:16:26,,

It would be really helpfull if the map had a zoom function and a waypoint/marker system. A companion would be cool like a dog or other animals? Finally what would make this game amazing and 5 stars would be the ability to create a complete custom class like an archer who can us heavy armor or knight that can summon etc, id even pay a reasonable to amount to add a well though dlc like that haha I hope you consider these ideas as id love to see what you can do with them :)",4,3,1.92,2015-12-19 01:43:07,,

Rather than just hack and slash, the items provided and spells are just so entertaining. Sometimes i find myself taking a stick and wacking all the monsters away.

I think this game is a prefect game for a phone:  Simple controls, lots of depth, can play for minutes or hours at a time.  Unlike Ultima V, this game is real-time (not turn based), single scale (in Ultima the scale changed during combat) and the commands are rather simple:  Move, attack, use, etc.  The real-time combat makes it a little more like old school zelda.  The conversations with non-player characters are somewhat linear, but don't let that stop you--this game is a lot of fun.  Great for killing an hour on the metro during commute.  BTW, like MANY games, this game will not run on Lollipop.  (I highly recommend against Lollipop for at least a few more months. Totally screwed up my Nexus 5.  Luckily Google is kind enough to make it easy to flash your Nexus back to KitKat.)  Update:  This game will not install on the Nvidia Shield Tablet.  Kind of a bummer.

If I have to jam something more than once to get it to work, then it's not a useable hotbar. 2)  Multiple outcomes for quests.  There are elements in Jinko's quest (which is probably the best quest in the game) that do this, but for the most part they are all linear.  Introduce some choice into the outcome of quests, preferably with moral quandaries involved, and have the different outcomes bestow different benefits on the player or affect the world in different ways.  3)  Ditch the easter-egg treasure hunt approach to quests.  Not a fan of scouring the entire world map for 7 treasures for which no clue is given as to their location.  This quest could have been made much more satisfying by placing meaningful location clues throughout the world... dialogue with characters referring to these treasures would've been nice.

Brings fond memories of old school pc gaming like ultima. Paying the 2$ to support the devs to continue updating this game and polishing was a no brainer. Huge open world to explore and get lost in. There  are a few little bugs but its expected. Just email the devs. On a galaxy note 10.1 the joystick controls are a bit awkward but not enough to take away the gameplay. Try the demo first. Update: the new update made it a lot easier to play on my tablet. The big thumbstick option makes it less awkward for my big thumbs and easier to play and hold. The floating thumbstick is a cool feature as well. Great job devs!!,5,5,1.22,2012-11-21 09:44:35,,

It sends my 2.3 pantech pocket into restart every 10 minutes. So -1 star. Otherwise it is the best. I only wish for a notebook to write the quests.,4,0,1.06,2012-11-06 18:32:15,,

I'm often left feeling diss appointed with the many classic offerings out there on play. 9th dawn stands apart from the crowd big style. Its a truly playable Retro masterpiece that doesn't leave you feeling that the good old days weren't as good as you remember! Instead it makes you keep coming back for just that bit more adventuring :-),5,1,1.02,2012-11-04 04:56:53,,
