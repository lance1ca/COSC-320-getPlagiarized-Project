There are a couple of issues, IMO. I don't have Android coding experience, so can't to speak directly to those mechanics. The soft buttons used to page forward & backward through the readings pages. Also, it seems like the cut/paste integration with the system UI is broken. It's been awhile since an update, so maybe some code tweaking could address these.
