Downloaded free game, tried to purchase hints, but none of the purchase buttons work. Clicking on any of them makes a ""click"" sound, but nothing happens. Multiple emails to their Customer Support went unanswered. Decided to buy full version for $6.99 - which is cheaper in the end. Had a problem there too! Completed a puzzle, but it would not let me proceed, no matter what I did. And again - NO response to emails! I really liked the game, too. What a waste of time!",1,6,1.0.1,2019-08-25 16:22:35,,

I was thrilled to see a new release. Custom settings, morphing objects, collectibles, map, and strategy guide make this another perfect game in the Legacy series. I would love to see more games released than one or two a year, but I would rather wait for an epic adventure than to play subpar junk like BigFish and Artifex Mundi churn out all too frequently. Thank you for continuing to delight your fans. 5 ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ² rating from me!",5,17,1.0.1,2019-06-27 17:56:59,"Hi Elaine,
