I tried compressing and equalising but the way they are implemented makes them unusable for serious editing. WavePad generates a preview each time a change is made to the effect. This preview generation takes quite a while, nearly 25 seconds on my Galaxy Tab S for a 3 minutes recording - so imagine on tablets with less powerfull processors! I would still accept this if WP would offer the possibility to easily compare the result of the preview to the original recording. But no, it's all trial and error.  WP doesn't allow to read files from SD card. This could lead to storage problems because WP creates a working copy in its own dedicated folder thus duplicating the amount of storage space used for each file.  WP allows to save recordings as MP3, but why only in 64kbps and 128kbps quality?  My verdict: although WavePad is packed with interesting features, the way they are implemented makes them mostly useless for serious sound file editing. That makes its price tag way too high! The free version would have been fine for me if it hadn't a limitation in using effects.",3,10,6.20,2015-08-30 12:43:32,"Hello, We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us.
