Ich w√ºrde gerne einen Feature Request hier stellen: Leider k√∂nnen items einer Checkliste nicht im View Modus in der App mittels eines Klicks getoggelt werden. Nur der Wechsel in den Edit Modus und das Um√§ndern von [ ] -> [x] f√ºhrt zu einem Toggel in der App. Es w√§re super, wenn dies in der App noch nachgezogen werden kann.

For instance I'd use it also to handle pre payroll and payment reminders for different dates and types every month, pre invoice and invoicing, recruitment reminders, taxes etc. Deck is cool because anyone can build it custom.
