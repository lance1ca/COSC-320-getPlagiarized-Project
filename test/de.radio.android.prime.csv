(It's still totally useless building podcasts into this app as there are much better apps dedicated to podcasts.) And radio favourites are easier to manage, but they could still use folders! But it's a good enough improvement to earn back a star. Except that it has also lost a star because there is no buffering. I have not been able to listen to any station without constant drop outs. There no longer seems to be an option that lets me set a high buffering time frame, nor can I choose a lower bitrate for any of these channels. I feel like these are two of the most basic options for a radio app, and this one now has neither. Still the best of a bad bunch of apps.
