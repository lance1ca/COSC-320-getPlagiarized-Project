This app has been my go to platform for nearly three years of gigs ranging from simple guitar/vocal setups to running FOH and 6 monitor mixes for multi-band festivals. So, speaking from experience, I would choose this app over the Apple platform for any ONE of the following reasons: 1 - Build Quality. It is fast, responsive and reliable to a fault. It just WORKS, no matter what I throw at it. 2 - Cost of Implementation. For the cost of a single iPad, I can buy three 10 inch tablets whose specs are more than sufficient to run this app in a manner best described as effortless. 3 - Efficiency of Use. You can literally create your own custom layout, giving immediate, top-layer access to every channel strip and control that is actually relevant to the gig at hand. 4 - Responsiveness of the Developer.

Still no love. I have another star for the better response. I believe the Dev has done all he can. Turning off sync gets you spotty functionality. Biggest concerned with that is that often times it reads faders all the way down which are not, when you try to adjust they drop all the way down before the fader comes up to where you adjusted.

As a workaround you could disable the sync.",2016-05-15 10:02:18
