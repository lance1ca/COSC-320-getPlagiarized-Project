Luckily I have a backup of an older version 1.4.3. What I hate about it is that the text is too close to the edge (1mm) which makes it hard to select the edge letter It's a good app but I will give it 4 stars because the text is too close to the left edge that you can't select small words like I, me, numbers. It should be a gap bigger than 1mm. The autosave should be to a temp file rather than overwriting the original file in case you would discard the changes.",2,0,,2019-10-19 18:10:21,,

It only works if the file already exists. 2. If there is no space between a Python code and a comment, the comment is not highlighted correctly. 3. If auto indentation is enabled, the character(s) used for indentation should be the one(s) set in Indentation Character setting. I also have two suggestions: 1. Main and New/Open/Save menus could be merged to increase simplicity. 2. An option to see hidden characters wouldn't be bad either. ;)",4,1,1.3.1,2017-11-10 04:27:14,,

But I just found one problem when upgrading to the Pro version. The Pro is a COMPLETELY SEPARATE app! This means I'm having to resync everything and customize the settings again. An ""upgrade"" should just add a license/serial that removes the ads. This way my app is already setup from before and ready to use. How does this even become a legitimate business decision?  UPDATE: Feedback Two things  1st) The cursor auto-centering behavior is annoying and can be bothersome when trying to type, as it could center the cursor just above the keyboard, making it hard to adjust the cursor if needed. A possible solution to this would be allowing manual scrolling while the keyboard is in view, and scrolling past the end of the code.  2nd) The accessory keyboard/view should always be visible. Even when the normal keyboard is present. It should be nested on top of the keyboard.",4,2,1.2.2,2017-04-12 11:05:21,,
