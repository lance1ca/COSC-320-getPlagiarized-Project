Since it was first released over thirty years ago this game has become highly addictive to more than one hundred million people worldwide! All you have to do is simply slide the paddle which is situated at the bottom of the screen, either to the left or right. The object of the game is to try and intercept the ball each time it comes down. You must be so very careful though - because if you should fail to make contact with the ball as it comes down, you automatically lose a life! In fact, if you are a beginner to this game, losing lives very quickly is not unexpected! However, with plenty of practice, you could become a truly great player! This computer gaming phenomenon has now been given the special twenty-first century treatment with added bonuses and extras to collect along the way! With endless hours of fun and frustration, hundreds of tantalising levels with difficulties to overcome, you will find this exciting game from the arcade era is too good to miss! Once you start playing the Brick Breaker Premium games, you will not want to stop!  10 / 10",5,5,1.6.0,2015-12-15 18:18:59,I appreciate your kind words. Thank you!,2015-12-17 21:50:08
