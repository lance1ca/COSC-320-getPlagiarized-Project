I found it through the developers tool (beaker) There are a few issues however: when you press menus enough times the menus break and you gotta reload the game/tool Also id like to see reactions with iron and carbon to make metals like steel but its just a idea Liquids bug out in the chemicals menu and i believe it has to do with temperature When you place a tool too high up it can be hard to grab it Theres no mixing tool to put in beakers Theres no placable cooler,4,5,5.0.3,2021-01-25 05:44:47,,
