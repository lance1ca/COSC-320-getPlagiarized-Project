I would like the ability to delete all the presets that came with the app. I'll never use them, as I prefer much lower frequencies. Another suggestion I have is to expand the sessions part of the app to allow custom sessions. I'd like to create a meditation session, for instance, that started with my alpha wave preset for 10 minutes, then phased into my theta preset for 30 minutes or more.   The only real issue I have, and the reason I'm only giving it four stars, is because periodically the tones will produce a very noticeable popping sound. While it's not a big deal if I'm using it while working, it gets quite distracting during meditation and self-hypnosis. Not sure if that's fixable, but if so, then I'll add a star.",4,15,4.0,2017-05-25 10:23:51,"Hi M. Thomas, thank you for your feedback, your suggestions are welcome.
