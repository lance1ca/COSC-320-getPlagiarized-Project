However there are serious QoL issues with the app. It supports multi-player, but only hot seat. Menacing you have to hand a single device around and be together in person. This is unfortunate on its own, but it also displays your favor cards to the other players when you hand them off. Tutorials are also unskippable which is annoying if you already know how to play",3,0,1.1.4,2021-02-02 23:55:11,,
