Because GoPro has official app for it which does same job better and free. In fact UI of this app is poor that other free apps are better at this than this paid one. Also the words used in app description are misleading. They used word live streaming. We can see live feed of camera in the app. It's called live feed. One would get confused it with live streaming to FB or Twitter like me. There is no support for live streaming to FB and TW.",2,5,1.07,2017-02-05 03:31:45,,
