Could benefit from some old features Worms2 and Worms Armageddon had. Overall it's fun and brings back memories. I haven't mess with the settings much but don't expect the same freedom that you had with the console or PC versions. Im halfway through the campaign but the AI is really dumb. I hope it's intentional that the AI commit suicide so often during the campaign and I hope there's a setting for that somewhere at least for the customs games.,4,7,2.06,2019-04-22 11:31:13,,

There are three or four weapons which you pretty much never see in an actual game with another player. There are a few other minor bugs and problems. When loading an online game it often loads the game you just played instead of the new one you're trying to load up. You need to tap the new game many times and see it load on the left before it'll correctly load the game you want. Also, perhaps because this is an old game, there aren't many people who play regularly these days so you may need to engage in ten or 20 different games at once to take maybe one turn per day.

The touch controls are a little buggy, so I recommend using the virtual d-pad option. I've played on both my Shield tablet and LG G4, and while the tablet is preferable, the G4 works flawlessly with no lag or issues. As far as a game goes, it isn't horrendous on battery life, which is surprising.  My biggest issue (and main reason for purchasing) is that multiplayer really isn't very well optimized. You can log in via Facebook, Google, or Team17 account, but I can't find any way to link all three. Also, I logged in with my Google account, but my friend logged in with a Team17 account. It was really difficult to find him (my account couldn't search players for a long time), and there is no way to view/verify listings after searching, so if your friend has a common name, good luck figuring out that you have the right person (easily.)

Our apologies for any confusion. 
The game only requires an internet connection for online multiplayer game modes and a momentary licence check once a month or so. 
The rest of the game is accessible without an internet connection. 
We hope that this helps resolve any confusion.

Sorry to hear about this issues. 
Taking another players turn is an issue that we're already aware of and looking into. 
If an opponent is inactive for 3 or more days, the server will force them to auto-forfeit. When this happens, you receive a win.

Android version has no serious issues and is very well playable except one problem which disqualifies it for casual gamers - it won't work after a longer break in playing it when at the same time there is no internet connection available. Think travelling abroad without data roaming or flying or staying in a hospital with very bad reception, you want to play a nice game to keep yourself occupied, pick Worms and you see ""Problem bla bla bla licensing bla bla"". This happened to me MANY TIMES this year only because I did not think about running Worms before traveling just to ""enable"" licensing. How ridiculous is that?  I've seen licensing FAQ but in this case there is even no need to reinstall the game or fiddle with sync - just running Worms when Internet is available again fixes the problem. Now, Team 17, make licensing less intrusive and I will give 5 stars as the game itself is marvellous. Because I could not play Worms for ALL reasons mentioned above THIS YEAR and I only want to play when I got time for it, I give you 1 star as Worms rarely works when I got that time. FYI I disable background apps",1,1,2.04,2015-09-17 16:46:57,"Good afternoon Secure,

Our apologies for any confusion. 
The game only requires an internet connection for online multiplayer game modes and a momentary licence check once a month or so. 
The rest of the game is accessible without an internet connection.

Fair question. Worms 3 can use your network (3G / 4G) connection for some of it's online features. So long as you don't exceed your mobile plans data limit, you shouldn't incur any subsequent charge. 
If you do go over your tariff, using network data in Worms 3 might cost you the same as it would with any other app.

This game could be so much more than it is, a minor update to Worms 2 which feels more like a REALLY poor job porting. For one thing, bugs everywhere where worms get stuck. Campaign is NOT properly ordered for difficulty. No options to turn off this silly team support worms which I enjoy but would like to change it up. Then there are the features that, when playing campaign, are completely useless. There needs to be a better way to score stars then time to victory. NOBODY will use girders or teleports, etc. when it's a shoot against time. Seriously disappointed by the efforts and complete lack of polish and options. I guess you can't have features added when the current ones are buggy! Just wish they would work out the kinks and wondering why it's taking SO long in this day and age. Honestly, I like Worms 2 on the PC more than Worms 3 on my Nexus 7 tablet.",2,8,2.04,2015-07-23 20:12:15,,

We're sorry to hear that you're unhappy with the asynchronous multiplayer in Worms 3. 
If you are in close proximity of your opponent, you might be better off playing Pass 'N' Play. This will allow you to engage in a multiplayer game, using a single device. 
We hope this proves useful.

I think the game, functioning as intended, deserves 2 stars. I really enjoyed the part of the game when I was actually playing. It looks and sounds great. My problem with the game is that there's just too much fluff. Consider a typical turn:   1. Overlay with picture of worm and name. (5 seconds, skippable if you control the worm). 2. Walk around, select weapon, aim, shoot. I.e., actual gameplay if you control the worm. 3. Shoot animation (depends, usually a second or two). 4. Slight delay, then damage applied (3-5 seconds). 5. If a worm died, they blow themselves up (3 seconds per worm). 6. Repeat step 4 until no worm dies. 7. Sometimes a crate drops (5 seconds). 7. Turn ends, return to step 1.  Count that up, and you'll see that you're not actually playing very much. I looked for some way to adjust the game speed, shorten animations, etc. but I found nothing. If it's there, it's well-hidden. I felt like I was mostly just watching silly, repetitive animations. If you're the kind of person that like to skip cutscenes (especially ones you've seen), you will find this infuriating, as I did. Too bad.",2,5,2.04,2015-04-17 13:29:59,,

The permissions that Worms 3 requires are fairly standard for mobile-multiplayer games.
There are likely more required permissions than in previous Worms titles as this version has more features.

I enjoy turn based games with friends and this game has definitely been added to the list, however the GUI could use a good amount of TLC. Multiplayer has issues - when playing multiple games it is difficult to switch between the games and way too often it is actually impossible and you have to exit out of the game and go back in to be able to switch. Zooming and panning do not work very well and entirely nonexistent/functional in multiplayer games when you're watching the other person.  You also can't pause or fast forward when watching another person's turn. It is silly that you can't customize the shot clock more - should be able to do way more than 90 seconds if you wanted especially in a custom/non-ranked game. I also get weird cloud sync messages and not sure if I should overwrite or not. And would be nice to have more depth to the solo campaign.

Our apologies for any confusion. 
The game only requires an internet connection for online multiplayer game modes and a momentary licence check once a month or so. 
The rest of the game is accessible without an internet connection. 
We hope that this helps resolve and confusion.

The rest of the game is accessible without an internet connection.

It sounds as though there might have been some confusion. There is an input style within the game which allows for touch input on a virtual D-Pad. Unfortunately, the game is not designed with support for the XBox 260 gamepad and might not work. 
We hope that this helps resolve any confusion.

You can dictate the direction that the Worm will move in by applying directional input while they perform the backflip. 
This is so that you have more control over the action and can effectively back-flip forwards!

We are sorry to hear that there has been some confusion. 
On devices running custom ROMs, or third party protection software, the game permissions for apps can sometimes produce a false positive for malware. 
Could you please contact help@team17support.com with your elected malware protection app name.

While Bluetooth isn't an option, you could always try a Pass 'N' Play game. This would allow you and your partner to play against one another on a single device.

We regularly play the game while sitting in our rooms and it so funny to here a yell of frustration from the other rooms.,3,0,2.00,2014-12-07 15:42:23,"Good afternoon Kevin,

Our apologies for any confusion. 
The game only requires an internet connection for online multiplayer game modes and a momentary licence check once a month or so. 
The rest of the game is accessible without an internet connection. 
We hope that this helps resolve and confusion.

Should this be reconsidered at a later date, we'll be sure to get in touch via update notes and notification.

There are a few bugs, for example, there is space between the worm and a slope. Also, I have not checked  if it was fixed yet, but in WA2, when you were on one of the steeper slopes your worm would stop changing his texture to match the slope. You might need some bug trackers to help find bugs or to test out weapons and features in development (that is, if you do not have any). And, I noticed that since I have Terraria, I got extra hats, graves, and a voice (you should add goggles as face accessory). Are there any other games (like Minecraft) that will give you items?

Couple suggestions.  Perhaps make some ""platinum"" cards that allow the perk to last the whole game. The graves should be able to push other worms when the worm dies. It would be nice to have a few more weapons to be honest. Should make some cards that unlock a special weapon for a round or for the game. Regarding multiplayer, the response time on the GS5 is very slow. Try making the connection quicker and the sending turn time quicker.

Very close to a huge hit for the Worms crew with  a few nagging issues.  I am finding this game to have a surprisingly low framerate with delayed audio on an Xperia Z2. There is no excuse for this app to have such poor performance on this type of hardware. Admittedly it could be something on my end, but I have yet to figure out what it is.  The touch controls are not so good, feeling sluggish. The gameplay itself is  quite slow. It might just be me, but I remember Worms playing a bit faster. Worm movement is slower than I expected (judging by how hard it is to squeeze your actions into your 60 second turn time). I'm a huge Worms fan, so I might give the tried and true Worms 2 Armageddon a try instead.  That said, I am confident that if there are bug fixes in the pipe, Team17 could turn this right around. The graphics are slick, the sound itself (when not delayed) is designed well, great effects for a mobile game, and interesting game design. The inclusion of ""cards"" actually spices things up a bit.",3,2,1.82,2014-07-14 21:04:13,"Good afternoon Stefan,

Also should have an aiming guide for where rockets are going, button on the left for aiming with a rought guide of where its gonna land and a button on the right to fire.  Other than that great like all your other games",4,4,1.77,2014-05-28 16:23:35,,
