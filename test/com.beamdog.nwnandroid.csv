Charge less or improve your games. Baldur's Gate looks great, the rest are bad, either SD, not HD, or just needs optimized. Bummer."" They replied that they are working on an update. I hope it fixes my concerns, because otherwise I would give this a 5-star review. I loved Baldur's Gate, it works fine. I have others, like Icewind Dale, but it looks SD, not HD, so it is another title in sore need of updating. I am sure these ports are hard for Android, with the myriad versions and devices. I am going to up this one star, and say that generally, these ports are worth at least watching. Too bad you can't test each port as a demo before you buy. $9.99 is worth it, but only if it works and works well. Good luck, devs, sincerely.",2,3,,2020-06-17 08:17:42,"Hi!

Initially I had a hard time getting used to the touch controls to play it on my 10.5 inch Samsung A tablet. The main issue is with the camera panning control... it should be reversed IMO. But once I got used to it, the game itself is almost as good as the original can expect to be played on a mobile platform. The game can be taxing for low-end devices. My mid-range Samsung A stutters in places where there are a lot of enemies on screen and this game should definitely be played on at least a 7~8 inch phone/tablet. Anything smaller I imagine you'll have a hard time managing the inventory menus. It is absolutely worth the money. It's a lot of original content for what it's asking. Nothing is ""randomly-generated"" and it delivers a good story line. It's great to re-experience NWN again, just like all the Baldur's Gate I&II/IWD/Planescape Torment I bought. I even tried it on Bluestack and it works on desktop PC!",5,28,8186A00005,2020-01-28 18:42:51,,

Now that my son is old enough to play, I started bragging this game to him almost a year ago and finally bought it on Android and Steam. I even bought him a new Pixel slate and myself a new laptop recently, and though they weren't bought specifically for NWN, this game was certainly on my mind when buying both. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the cross platform LAN setup is in great shape. He hasn't been able to connect to my Linux game because of a timeout error - nothing shows on the server side. After days of sitting bent over the computer searching for some relevant info it's looking like this is a no-go for multiplayer. At any rate, my son is in the middle of chapter 2 in the OC and has encountered a few glitches, but nothing too serious except that he sometimes has to do a full restart the tablet because the app only comes up with a grey screen. There's also the LAN connect, of course. Seems like there's still room for improvement, but I have to say it's great to have this game back in action again.

This is the game of a D&D player. Not as clumsy or as random as a free-to-play clicker. An elegant RPG... for a more civilized age. Recommend you play this on a high-powered chromebook or tablet with a keyboard. The keyboard shortcuts are what really makes the game playable. This game may seem a bit complex when you first start. Here are some tips for newcomers: * Learn all the keyboard shortcuts. Especially the 'space' key to pause the game. Any time you are about to get into combat, hit the space key to buy yourself some time to queue up your actions. Also the 'G' key is your friend. Quicksave often, especially before you open a door into an unknown area... * Use the standard camera follow mode. This setup has the camera sort of float behind your character. Get used to moving around with the WASD keys. If you need to zoom in and out you can use the arrows. You should rarely need to control the camera manually in this mode. I mapped the . and / keys to the 'raise' and 'lower' camera actions. This is because the Pixelbook doesn't have easily accessible F1-F12 or pgup/pgdown keys. * If your chromebook has a touchpad (or external mouse) you can access most of the options for anything by long-clicking on it. This is one of the great things about this game. You can do actions from almost anywhere using the radial menus. Take some time to go through each option for your items and understand what they all do. * Sometimes the doors between areas will get a bit buggy. Back up and go through the door again and it will work. Also, if your keyboard controls stop working, ALT-TAB to another application (like Chrome), and back into the game. This seems to reset the inputs. * Often your character or henchman will be in the way while you're trying to click on a chest or bag. Use the Q and E keys to sidestep away from the chest before you click on it. * Load up your quickbar with the actions and weapons you use the most. You can put two weapons or a weapon and a shield into the same quickbar spot, for quick access. The game has 50-60 hours of content for you to enjoy.

The controls take a little getting used to (or remembering). Keyboard controls aren't really supported if you attach a keyboard, but some keys work as expected. I didn't have any problem with switching to and from the game and other apps, but there's no reason not to save frequently, either. I haven't tried any of the multiplayer options.

Same with zoom. At least on my Pixel C, rotating by swiping the screen edge rarely works. Instead try swiping close to the character. Second, taps sometimes take two or more taps to execute commands (opening chests, collecting loot, or even just moving). Probably because the game is originally designed for a mouse and not my fat fingers. There are other minor issues as well, but if you can get used to the quirks it is a fun game.

I've spent countless hours playing NWN on the pc and now I can spend even more hours playing on my phone. :) I've already come across some graphics issues but I don't care. I know this won't be perfect. I'm just thrilled I can play again!,5,14,8186A00003,2018-12-08 16:55:49,,

The fact that I get to create my own character from, I guess, scratch like that is amazing. I've never played Dnd but I do wish to try it one day. This is an amazing port but can you fix some of the lag that I tend to encounter at times? It just randomly comes and it doesn't affect me much. Either way, amazing game.",5,7,8186A00003,2018-12-08 13:27:17,Hello!

Once again Beamdog nocks it out of the park. NWN port was done flawlessly. its strong suits are modules and user created content and multiplayer and cross platform play. I cant wait to see what they do next. hopefully some more original content like SODS.,5,7,8186A00003,2018-12-06 00:40:50,,

And now my wife will finally join me now that she can play on her phone. Overrides and all other custom content works via simple drag and drop. Hooked up my saves folders to drop box already with flawless execution. Premium modules purchased on PC even transfer over without a hitch (if you move the files). UI and controls are suprisingly very good. My wife by far prefers the phone controls to PC controls. Text is very readable and the scaling adjustments make it work well on smaller screen sizes. And having the game in my pocket has me replaying and appreciating the main story content all over again. It's absolutely crazy the amount of entertainment value this much money gets you. Beamdog hit it out of the park this time.,5,142,8186A00003,2018-12-04 13:39:57,,
