While visually having more than one alien blip is pretty cool on the tracker.. You can easily ""control"" the distance when you set it to 1 on both speed and number. Gives the ""moving about"" feel more natural, also gives you more control as to how fast the blip moves to the center. You'd have to tap in between pulses to not ""cut"" the blip sound. Just my two cents if adding the noise when playing the Alien RPG.",5,0,1.0.4,2020-11-08 00:19:12,,
