So impressed with that aspect of the game. Overall, it's a short game but worth buying IMO.",5,24,1.0.0,2020-07-06 09:15:07,,

Actually has controller support in game too, just doesn't work on the menus. Be worthy of five stars with full controller support, including menus.",4,15,1.0.0,2020-06-25 11:53:20,,

I enjoyed the very Kirby like game. :3 üëç The downsides would be it's hard to get the whip to attach to the nodes and that it's only 5 stages long. Achievements and more levels would be a nice addition someday.",4,28,1.0.0,2020-05-25 13:12:48,,
