One of the most poorly optimized experiences I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. I'm using a Samsung J7 Prime to run this game and it is terrible. I can only select high or medium graphics (no option for low) and I can only pick either HD or Full HD nothing less and as a result it runs horribly. The motion linked camera in the menu is a joke that adds even more lag to the pot and seems to break every 3 seconds to have a small fitt before returning to the laggy mess it usually is. Selecting anything in the menu takes a full 10 seconds to lag into existence  (load) and the gameplay if you could call it that is laughable! First when loading in, the game lags and then it sits there momentarily perfect with no issues whatsoever - then the second you touch the screen to move the camera it begins to jult around in a full 360 degree mess, never stopping in one place for longer than a milisecond before picking another random angle to briefly freez at all the while this keeps happening even if I'm not touching the screen.

With the price of the app, many would be hesitant to try it unless personally recommend by friends. A free multiplayer version will allow them to try the game before committing and let them  play with their friends.

Tank levels are normalised, but player level(skill) is not. The biggest complaint I have are the back end servers that Handle tank customization. I can't tell you how much in game cash I've lost due to the game taking my money for swapping out components, only to hang and never apply the new component. The hangs are a pure pain. The game starts to feel more like a loading simulator than a tank simulator.  Additionally, you'll get matched with PC players who have finer control of their tanks due to having a mouse and they will utterly wreck you.",2,2,1.0.2,2017-06-21 02:16:31,,
