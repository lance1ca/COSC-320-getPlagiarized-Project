I was fine with that - I'm looking for a minimalist way to practice at home. Unfortunately this app is also super buggy. Try and turn down the background music? The voice queues go away. Skip a pose? The voice queues go away. There's also no way to customize to do single sets, or make a custom program which seems obvious.",1,0,,2020-09-19 14:37:17,,
