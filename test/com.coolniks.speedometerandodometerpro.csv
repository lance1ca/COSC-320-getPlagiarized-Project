The satellite reception is never less than 10 satellites and normally 16 satellites. The speed error or spikes will occasionally occur on flat sections of roadway but is most pronounced when descending, where the greatest spike anomalies are recorded. This lack of smoothing is borne out by observing the operating app in a stationary situation displaying a a speed of up to 3 KMH. I have a requirement for a very accurate highest recorded speed and real time speed (100 - 110 KMH). Any assistance you can offer will be gratefully accepted.",3,3,10.5,2018-11-10 15:08:24,"The app is completely dependent on the GPS connectivity.
