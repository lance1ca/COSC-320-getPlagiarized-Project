When it did it did not disappoint.  I was able to sync my DB with NO ISSUES after setting up DVD profiler on my PC.  If anyone has issues you should consider going to the DVD profiler forums BEFORE rating it any less then 4 stars.  The rating system is based on how well the program works.  People rating on the sole fact that they are not able to setup their connection properly need to realize that is not the fault of the app.  The only issue I've had with the app is the barcode scanner sometimes is faulty.,4,1,1.0.1,2014-03-05 12:13:27,,
