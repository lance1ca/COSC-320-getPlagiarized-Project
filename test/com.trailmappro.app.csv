Works great without an internet connection.  Tells you exactly where the trails are, where you are on the trail and gives great descriptions of the trails.  Also information about beaches, snorkeling, and much more.  Well worth the charge!!!  Works great on my HTC 10.",5,4,1.2,2016-06-28 06:05:53,,

I love how it can be used in offline mode so that my cell phone is not hit with roaming charges and it works when there is no connection. There is enough information to keep a person busy for weeks exploring the beautiful island. I hope more is added to this app such as restaurants and updated regularly. Well worth the $1.99!  Not as much information as the book but much more convenient! With a waterproof phone case I can even look where we want to go next while snorkeling :)",5,4,1.2,2015-12-17 14:04:34,,
