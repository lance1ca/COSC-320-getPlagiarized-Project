Was excited to see a fresh, new way to get on Facebook 
without their horrendous app. I saw this posted in a Reddit thread where 
the developer was offering the app at a discount and seemed like they were 
going to do great things with it. Now it's a mess and the devs are nowhere 
to be found. The app will auto play videos randomly. Go to someone's 
profile, and if they posted a video within the last couple days it will 
play. If you back out, it will pop up again a second later. Turning off 
autoplay in Facebook settings doesn't help out at all. A new issue that 
I've read others have had for awhile started for me. When you load up your 
feed, 10 seconds later it takes you to a page that just says ""Success"". 
Like the videos, backing out will just bring it back up shortly after. 
Sometimes comments don't post. Using your phones built in share feature for 
photos or videos is a nightmare, and tends to fail more than it works. 
While I like the general idea of the app, and how it had worked in the 
past, I cannot recommend it for the time being. Too many bugs that 
apparently have been around for sometime, but nothing being done about it. 
Will likely go to another third party app, or even grab the official one 
again. If these issues get fixed, my rating and review will change.",2,0,6.2.3,2018-06-10 22:00:24,,

The app has some great customisation options and the inclusion of gestures such as the swipe left to go back is great. For those who don't want to download a whole new messaging app it has messenger built that works well. My favourite feature is no advertising in your feed haha.   Unfortunately it does have many glitches like when in night mode some random boxes will be white with white text, images not properly fit the image space or be far too large, notifications will keep popping up despite already checking them as well as friend requests glitching out.   This app is so close to being great but the technical shortcomings let it down, I'd say it's still worth giving it a go if you want a more customised Facebook experience just keep in mind it has a few hiccups.",3,0,7.2.14a,2018-04-03 15:35:37,,

The app went from having many glitches to now not working at all.  At this point in time, I am unable to open Swipe Pro as it crashes before it even opens. I really used to like this app, but I don't understand why it's come to this. First it was the issue of automatic play of videos, which prevented me from moving past that video on any given page. The settings lacked the video settings option to turn off the auto video play. Then yesterday, any time I tried to open an article or any Facebook post, I was either redirected to a blank screen that said ""Success"", or the page refreshed in a constant loop with other glitches.

This app opens a new window for this and it tries to open multiple videos at the same time (as many are in the feed), and it then crashes. I only give a low rating because there is no way to control the auto-play setting for the videos in this app and it must be done via the app to properly shut it off on mobile.

If you've gotten stuck anywhere in the app, there's a simple solution for this! If you press on the tab you're on, it'll scroll back to top, but once at the top, if you press on it again, it'll reset the tab (i.e. Notifs tab will reset back to notifs), Give it a shot!

Apologies for not having responded sooner, I have been quite busy with personal things lately.
