The normal game that I kept losing the AI had mined 4-5x more minerals than me even though I controlled 3 mineral fields and had 5 refineries. They had an almost endless stream of mechs attacking my main base, there was no way I could counter. Also, one of their mechs could take out 2 of mine. I did have upgraded units and a mix of mechs, it didn't matter, they barreled right through my turrets even when assisted by my mechs and they kept coming faster than I could repair or build more mechs.

AI is definitely improved from the last game and the AI will straight  up murder you if you don't scout and prepare  for attacks.   I do like how you have more choices about where to place buildings and the attempt to make the races unique (at least aesthetically), but I still think feel most units are too similar.  Slight differences in attack range, unit speed, and health are not enough to make the gameplay interesting.  Maybe adding stealth units, detection, aoe, and even assign in different supply costs to units might make things interesting.  In terms of the game economy, i like to play a high economy playstyle like in SC, and the limit of 3 structures building at one time prevents that.  Maybe for the next game just remove the limit or increase this number of structures you can build at one time?  Also I would like to have some sort of spellcaster ability or hero u nit, as there currently is no incentive to do anything but Zerg the opponent.  Also I feel that the turrets are weak, even when placing many of them.  Maybe add some sort of upgrade to them or have different types of turrets.  Then you can add some sort of siege units to take them down.  Would make the gameplay more fun and varied.",4,4,1.0,2018-01-25 09:55:51,,

Thank you for your feedback!

The orange robots are pirates. They are landing in random places and hunting after harvesters. Armory increases params on 10% with each level. Lightnings has more damage but lowest range. All depends from your style of play, H.Wheels + Plasa with good microcontroller could be more stronger than Lightings.",2017-12-17 19:23:06
