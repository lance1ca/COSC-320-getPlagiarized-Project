Play the regular space agency and I'm happy with how the creator built both games. I rated the controls a 4 because there needs to be more options available rather than the one control setup that's preset. It works fine but moving around the buttons or being able to flip the turning ability so the direction you swipe is the way you turn instead of the opposite it's currently set at. I know it's a new game but this is just advice that hopefully will be considered.,5,3,1.1.1,2020-07-05 20:38:42,,

Been playing Space Agency like crazy lately. The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is really fun. Ive only just started so cant really comment on too much yet. My tablet doesnt support it which stinks but oh well ill deal with my phone screen. Im excited for future updates. Im hoping for some missions like in space agency and maybe the option to customize the game such as start with nothing but not have faults be frequent and such.

I cant progress past the tutorials and start a new save because the text boxes wont bring up my keyboard so I can't enter a name for the save. I'm on a Samsung galaxy A8 if that's useful. Hopefully you can fix that soon. Thanks!,4,6,1.0.2,2020-04-17 16:30:53,,
