It was something easy for a non gamer like me to play as well as kept us intrigued on what would happen next. My only problem is that even if your level for your character is lower than the place you are going to you can still succeed and move on. Cause of that we got all the way to the end and just dropped it cause there wasn't anything keeping us wanting to play. Great game to play just a little too easy and quick to beat with others.,4,5,,2021-01-22 07:26:14,,

That is something I absolutely love about this game. You see amazing equipment that you want, but aren't time gated or required to farm 1 fight to get 1 ingredient to craft an item. Drop rates are amazing as well, so when you're trying to optimize gear, you don't spend a week trying to get 1 item like in MMOs. The developers really make it so that you're not feeling like it's a boring chore.   - Combat  The combat system in Portal Knights isn't anything special. There is nothing wrong with that, however, you can also dodge. This one additional mechanic really makes the combat enjoyable.  - Story  Typical simple story. Not much to say.  -Character Customization  I love it. You can change the appearance of your character again after you create it. Also, armor is allowed to be worn as vanity items at any level and any class as well. Customization is awesome and I want to thank the developers for making a great and enjoyable game.",5,9,1.5.3,2019-08-08 07:54:05,"Thanks for the review, Tai :)",2019-08-02 16:03:19

does a really good job of randomizing it's world's caves and dungeons and 
the large universe takes a long time to get through. As refreshing as this 
is, this game still falls short on a few things. First of all, as far as I 
can tell there is no pause button and it's downright infuriating at times. 
Secondly, there are only three fun but mostly easy major bosses and their 
very hard hardmode equivalents...you gotta do better than that in this day 
and age when especially when your the company behind Terraria. At least 
make a lot more mini bosses or hallowed prince like events! Thirdly, its 
always bugged me when games do infinite arrows for the ranger class...not 
realistic. They should be limited and get to use light weapons in my 
opinion. Lastly, there's still room for improvements like more moves (like 
blocking or jumping in combat), Chest Guardians/mini bosses, Dungeon Traps, 
and more reasons to explore earlier Islands (perhaps events, enemies, 
chests, or minerals triggered by defeating a boss...which is very 
Terraria-like but it works for a reason). Great game. I look forward to new

Only issue I ran into was the screen turning black after attacking a slime in first person mode. Also the mining in first person is confusing once the magnifying glass thing pops up. Don't like how I have to guess which block Im trying to mine. Can you guys make mining controls similar to Minecraft where you can move the reticle freely? Multiplayer would be nice if you can have visible servers instead of searching for them or having a multiplayer game where you have to have friends play instead of just playing with random players who purchased the game. A world chat would also be nice to communicate with other players. Overall a great game but could use added features!,4,0,1.3.3,2018-03-13 07:05:30,"Hi Omar, thanks for reviewing.

The game overall is very well rounded, until the end game, which I'll get in to. Just the right amount of difficulty, beautiful graphics, and great crafting mechanics. The camera controls are difficult on mobile, especially when mining, but you get used to it. I played a Mage and it was fairly well balanced. I never felt too overpowered. However, I'm now on the hard mode bosses and they are virtually impossible on mobile. The camera angles don't allow you to dodge some attacks  and getting to close to a boss gives you a black screen that you have to restart the app to fix. Without those bosses, there's really nothing left to do. I may create a new character, but for now, my mage is done. Overall a decent game, but mobile needs addressing in the above aspects. 4/5.",4,2,1.3.0,2018-03-02 15:36:47,"Thanks for the great review.

Only to contact the actual dev team and they can look into it. Support seemed pretty lackluster and pretty disappointed with the overall communication I've had. It's only a 5 game, but I've bought this numerous times on different ports.    I have a Galaxy S8. And even playing on the lowest settings I get a sluggish frame rate.    Portal Knights is a PC port to mobile. And what a wonderful job they've done! It's a well pieced together title with lots of lore.   I'd suggest watching a few YouTube videos if you aren't familiar with the title.  NOW... I have a Samsung Galaxy S8.     At the moment it's one of the highest end flag ships you can buy. And even at medium - low settings I'm struggling to get a playable frame rate. I'm not sure what devices they're targeting.. But whew.. it shouldn't be that low of FPS.   UPDATE:  I've tried the largest and smallest world preset as well as the lowest and highest graphical preset and the performance is still lack luster. When I toggle the highest graphical option I'm barely get a few frames per second. It's like a power point presentation. At the lowest it's manageable but doesn't feel as smooth as say Minecraft.  I keep a pretty sleek setup with minimal apps. And even toggled High Performance Mode.  That said, as of me writing this the game literally just came out today. Hopefully if they take community feedback seriously this should be addressed.  UPDATE 1:  I've also lowered the screen resolution and this did not fix the fps issue.  It's be nice to have a brightness scale within the options menu.",1,13,1.2.7,2017-12-18 05:29:52,Players experiencing a flashing/flickering menu should now be able to get in-game.
