I've increased my rating to a four, as once you get used to it, it's really a very good app. I normally use a BMPCC4K and edit in DaVinci Resolve and have used results from my phone in Resolve and I'm quite pleased as to how I can integrate video from my phone with video from my BMPCC4K. Despite the significant differences between the two cameras, the results can blend in well. I'm still hoping that Filmic Pro can update the app to allow shutter angle as a default setting with all fps choices. Give me that and it's a five star app. I just bought both the Filmic Pro and the Cinematographer Kit for my Xiaomi Redmi Note 9s and both work perfectly. A quick test with the Evaluator app indicated that all would be good and so it was. The only thing I can't work out is how to get the focus circle and exposure square both to appear in the centre of the screen on start up and the exposure square to be a bit larger. Additionally, I'm not sure whether the app sets the shutter angle automatically to 180 degrees, for when I open the manual control, the shutter speed is never twice the fps, but usually much lower. After a couple of days use, there are two issues that disappoint greatly. Firstly, the fact that you can't set a shutter angle and have it default to 180 degrees of the fps set is a huge omission. Secondly, whenever you set shutter speed/ISO, and return to the main screen, the settings revert to what it was before adjusting or you can't refocus/re-expose. Two major shortfalls for a pro app. I wanted to provide an update on this app. Firstly, other than the issues I noted, this app really does make the phone video work so much better. Editing in DaVinci Resolve produces excellent results and would be outstanding if the camera in the phone was one of the higher end ones. I've also been in contact with Filmic Pro and explained my issues, hopefully more clearly. If they can implement what I've suggested, then this app will offer features similar to a cinema camera.",4,9,6.12.5,2020-10-15 17:08:21,"Hi, thank you for the detailed review.

I have searched the Sd card with Android file transfer and still cannot find them. They are there because when the card is removed FP reports them missing until I re insert the card where it reports it has found lost files and is restoring them, and there they are available.

Both apps were very crash happy. F-Pro had another big issue that FV5 didn‚Äôt; frame drops. The fix is turning on airplane mode, closing other apps, plus running in gaming mode (performance mode on some phones). My phone isn‚Äôt high end (OnePlus 3) but that was enough to get past the dropped frames as long as I dont go above 2k. Camera FV5 can go up to 4k though, so there are performance issues with F-Pro that FV5 does not have (I tested this extensively using like-for-like footage). The remaining issue is the inability to reliably shoot flat or log footage; an overheating issue. Perhaps this will get better with future releases. Finally, worth noting a big feature that Filmic Pro has that Cinema-FV5 doesn‚Äôt have; the ability to set a 180 degree shutter (so 1/50s for 24fps). You need this for footage that has the smoothness of cinema rather than the overly sharp and jerky video look. This is a game changer, and even though F-Pro limits me to 2k. You also need a variable ND filter to get decent exposure. I recommend a 37mm variable ND on a 37mm threaded clip. In the end, F-Pro is the one to go for because it has a crucial feature that the competition doesn‚Äôt (180 degree shutter). It also works well on my aging onePlus 3 (as long as I accept 2k as the max resolution), and has the better UI.",4,32,6.9.1,2020-03-01 08:03:37,"Hi Sham, thank you so much for your extended review üôÇ.

Firstly when I have no network connection I constantly get a message that the app is not registered and so cannot be used.

Secondly when shooting interviews with a Rode Video Micro attached to my One Plus 6 the audio is totally out of sync with the video - to the extent the footage is not usable.

I didn't expect this for a paid app.   I can live with even the exposure ring not being available, but not being able to do 60 fps with 1080p is crazy.

It doesn't work, keep getting a SDK error even though my DJI osmo works fine. Tried reinstalling both the DJI software, filmic pro, and resetting all setting on my phone. Still doesn't work. Then filmix pro app gave error stating the app wasnt registed, and told me to re purchase the app. Seems to be a really poor implementation, if filmic pro cannot fix this I will be asking for my money back. These issues are nothing new, i've been reading through the comments on this app, and it seems that it is just plagued with issues. How can you take customers money with such a faulty product. At the very least you should compensate your customers with free addons, due to the wait they are forced to endure until the product is fixed. Followed instructions from filmic pro support, device worked twice, then started failing again with a new error, the app crashed and closed out. Does this every time I try to connect the gimbal. Also be aware that the app requires excessive phone permissions to work. Can the app developers please justify why so many permissions are required.

using the native camera app to get smooth footage. The app also 
occasionally just become black and stuck there when switching resolution or 
relocking the shutter speed so I have to kill and open the app again. Not a

but it would be fantastic if it supported Active Tracking too. I'm 
experiencing some problems on LG V30, maybe the app could get a little 
polishing for this device too considering it's very capable for video 
production. Some of the issues: -I can turn off noise reduction, it 
sometimes works but it turns itself back on whenever the preview 
reinitializes after changing other settings like resolution or after 
finishing recording a video. After this occurs, the only consistent way to 
turn the noise reduction back off is by going into settings, switching the 
noise reduction from disabled to fast or high then turning noise reduction 
off again, exiting settings, then move the focus reticle. -The audio 
channels are reversed on the V30 when the phone is rotated in landscape 
mode counterclockwise (this is the only way it can be mounted in the osmo 2 
without obstructing the microphone on the right). I'm currently recording 
audio with a different app running in the background and record video only 
with Filmic. It's a lot of extra work synching audio, it would be great if 
this issue could be fixed. -120 fps 1080p videos with the playback rate set 
to 24 fps are dropping frames like crazy but the recordings are fine if the 
playback rate is left at 120 fps and the video is slowed down in post or by 
just remuxing the mp4 file and forcing the framerate to 24. -No HDR support

How do I go about getting a refund?  I'm using filmic pro on a Google Pixel and I'm getting quite a lot of difference in the recorded frame rates. I'm choosing 25FPS and each take varies quite a bit in its frame rate. One take even went down to 13.16FPS, others are fractional rates around the 22 to 24 mark, despite choosing 25FPS. I'd been shooting outside with a lot of light as well, so it's not the shutter being dropped to gain light and then the frame rate being matched to the shutter for low light exposure.  Even if I try the experimental force frame rate function I get the same results. These frame rates obviously can't be cut together in a 25FPS project without interpolation and/or frame blending, which isn't acceptable. It would also make the footage impossible to cut with another synchronised camera.  The same also happens with 30FPS, although I've not tried that rate as much as I wouldn't usually use it, I only tried it to see if I could get any timebase with a solid frame rate.

Although I still think calling them sync frame rates is misleading (because they are still variable) I am improving my review from 1 to 3 stars because of the customer service. Obviously, in general phone developers' camera software still has a long way to go before they will even be as reliable as DSLRs. First Review: If you wanted sync frame rates on your GS6 look elsewhere.  This app will not do them. This app is worse than the stock android app. Frame rates are farther off from goal, the default picture profile is to contrasty and has a severe green tint. No histograms. No 720@120fps despite  native support of it.

I can move the slider which will temporarily move the camera focus to that point, but then the camera immediately attempts to auto focus on something else within the frame.

Often freezes up when adjusting exposure using this camera. -Audio monitoring goes mental when you unplug headphones while it's switched on. I.e. loads of horrible feedback -Occasional failure of audio at beginning of video recording.  -Not a glitch,  but inability to have higher frame rate than 30p. -Inability to save audio gain setting, which would be useful for when using different equipment. -the app forgets every single setting as soon as you quit the app or the phone goes to sleep.
