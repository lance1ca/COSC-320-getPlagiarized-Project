You are locked on a single romance option and can't choose who you want to be with despite having other characters. And you get to witness an awkwardly progressing romance between other two characters. The story is good overall, a few unmatching lines, a lot of funny moments and emotional scenes from start to end; it's a good experience.",4,8,5,2019-04-28 23:41:12,,
