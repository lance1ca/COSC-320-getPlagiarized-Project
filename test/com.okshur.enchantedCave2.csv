I'm not usually a fan of Rogue-like perma-death games and I'll admit that I picked this up twice and put it back down. But the third time was a charm. I found my groove and planned my character and progression to compliment my play-style. I was conservative and not a afraid to return to levels to build up my own character level, and tweak the skill tree.  Doing this I was able to finally beat the game.    I didn't know you could enchant items either the first couple of times and that made it more difficult. Enchanting items made the game a lot more fun and it felt more ""custom"" .    I'm not sure what the cost of the game is now but IMO it was worth up to $7 and anything cheaper than that makes it even more worth it.

You could also try going to settings, storage, and unmount your SD card, install the app, and mount the card again.

I'm just guessing here, installation is on the Android platforms side, I have no control over that. :(",2015-05-06 13:04:48

The graphics are charming, the enchantment system injects an element of planning beyond simply changing equipment out whenever you get the next best item, and the stat-gems make a quick run through the cave both worthwhile and fulfilling even when you only have 5 minutes to waste.  However the most interesting and at once frustrating feature of the game is the New Game+ option available after finishing it. Your second run through the Cave is substantially more challenging than the first, with all enemies posing a threat which they absolutely did not previously. This breathes new life into the game as you now experience fear of death and losing progress.  However, while the enemies benefit from a boost in stats during NG+, the player does not receive any options for new and better equipment to face them. The enemies become stronger and you develop only so far as you can grind out stat gem finds. As a result of the loot system, if you do not already have the best items, you are screwed until reaching floors 90-99. The game would massively benefit from adding items to this stage which are buffed versions of their NG counterparts.",4,12,2.13,2015-05-01 10:47:47,,
