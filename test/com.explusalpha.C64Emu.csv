On screen joystick is nice, even gives you the chance to add F1 button support on screen (for a total of two game pad buttons + 1 F key); My advice to the programmer? Maybe make an extra button or two and make them BOTH mappable to whatever key you want...

They run just fine, but it takes a few to get them going.  Third, it will only load the first file on the disk image (load""*"",8,1).

The port appears to be Vice x64.exe and not the x64sc.exe. A Bluetooth keyboard can be set up quickly. Most of the important options are implemented but some missed options will frustrate veteran C64 users.    1. Missing disk write protect tab option. Some original games like Bounty Bob have protection that either erases your disk or fails to load if the disk is writable. Please add an option for a read-only disk.   2. The UI forces users to automatically load something before starting. I work around this by using an Action Replay 6.crt cartridge to start up.    3. Missing freezer button for Action Replay 6.   4. The hardware reset does not reset all RAM as seen with ‚ÄúSheep In Space‚Äù A soft reset would be nice to have. The disk should to have its own reset.  5. Missing parent directory navigation when using the ROM DISK TAPE control. The workaround is to merge folders.    I rate 3 stars. C64 emulators require a surprising amount of sophistication to run the most demanding titles. If these items are fixed then I would rate 4 stars. If an x64sc option is available too then 5 stars would be in order.  Keep up the good work!,3,5,1.5.12,2013-05-31 14:37:54,,

Despite Android having great emulators for most platforms all the current C64 ones were aweful. Frodo was best but didnt support .tap files so most of my collection couldnt be played.  My two fav games were Super Robinhood and Secret Agent. None of these played on the other Android C64 emulators but I read the reviews of this Emu and decided ¬£2.99 was only the price of a C64 game and its great. Get!,5,0,1.5.10,2013-04-15 12:59:42,,
