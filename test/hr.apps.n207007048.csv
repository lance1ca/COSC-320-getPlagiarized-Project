The plans have many gaps leaving question marks, leaving me to just assume most things. It's like most of the content in the app was just copied and pasted from open source material, which I had already achieved with a lot more information. So there seems there's not too much attention applied to the details, hence the question on what makes this worth $10, I would of supplied extra information that couldn't have been sourced for free!",4,13,5.61.3,2017-03-16 15:53:01,,

The most brilliant, creative and forward thinkers of the 21st century are encouraging open source; not just for software, but for everything.  The Internet Age has shown everyone that the traditional patent system slows, limits and even halts development.  More and more brilliant people (like Linux, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg) are ""Copy-Lefting"" their ideas.  It is doubtful patents will become obsolete, but patented technologies will certainly fall far behind their open source counter-parts and it will be difficult for them to compete.  Tesla Motors - Our Patents Belong to you. ""Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the worldâ€™s most talented engineers.

The idea of the app and making the info more open source is awesome guys.
