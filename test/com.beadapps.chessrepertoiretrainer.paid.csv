The inability to have multiple moves available in a single position is a weakness in my opinion. Another is that, even in 'full coverage' training mode the app brings up lines that have been seen many times while there are plenty of lines that are completely untouched. It seems like you have to train the entire set of lines in 1 sitting to get to 100% coverage. These 2 issues fixed and the app is easily 5 stars.",3,3,6.4.3-pro,2021-01-19 02:47:10,"If you are creating an opening for Black, remember that you can only enter one move for Black, which would be your favorite move for the chessboard position you are facing. So if White's first move is 1.d4, then you must choose your favorite move either 1...d5 or 1...Nf6. Hope this helps. For any question, email us at beadapps.help@gmail.com",2021-01-16 03:00:25
