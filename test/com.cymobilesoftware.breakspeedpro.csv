Second, it also desperately needs an update. You should be able to add more than one person/profile. When two or three of people are breaking it would come in handy to be able to change the profile and not mess with your own settings and averages. Yes I know you can delete breks. Third, I often get 43 mph break speed and sometimes 3 mph. What's up with that...lol? I'm usually in the low 20's and then suddenly I'm over 40 or at 3 mph. That makes it hard to be able to trust the other numbers. Why is 24 mph any more correct then 43 mph? Fourth, on the sound wave screen it should be a lot easier to zoom in and slide the bars around without hiccups. This is a total mess of an app. Regret buying it.

Instead they push users to post result to social media. I would be okay with that if the app was free. I am not a fan of forced promotion of an app I paid for.
