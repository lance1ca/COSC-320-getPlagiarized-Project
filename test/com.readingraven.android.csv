absorbed I have seen him in any reading activity. His favorite aspect is 
recording his voice and hearing himself. My son is not very interested in 
video games, but everything about this app is very engaging for him. His 
friend had it on iPad and my son was really excited about it. I was 
surprised to realize that I happened to look for it on the very day it was 
launched here. My son has progressed very quickly so I hope Vol. 2 comes 
out soon.",5,22,1.08,2018-06-11 17:04:54,,
