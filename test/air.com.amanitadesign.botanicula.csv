I too had to start over but I had not gotten very far. This is a really cute, fun puzzle game. The music suits it perfectly and is not overbearing at all. Unlike most games, I play this one with the sound all the way up. It is just challenging enough for me, I get stumped now and then but then I can figure it out on my own. I absolutely love it. :) Happy gamer girl!",5,1,1.0.12,2014-11-02 05:24:25,,
