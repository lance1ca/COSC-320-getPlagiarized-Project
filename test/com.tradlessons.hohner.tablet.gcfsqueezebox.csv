Is great for tablets but a waste for smartphone users. Take out the grill so you can expand the buttons. If you can't make a product that works well then don't offer it at all. It only makes it look like you are just interested in making money.,1,33,1.3,2013-10-09 20:38:07,"Expand the buttons how? There are 31 buttons on this style of accordion.
