The movement of the objects on the screen were rather jerky, which kinda gave me a headache after just a minute of play. To be honest, I feel like usually Thup puts quite a bit of effort into the quality of the art used for their games, but this one felt very subpar on pretty much all of the artwork. I felt like it was the quality you would see for a $0.99 game or possibly even a free game.",3,4,,2016-02-24 19:28:20,,
