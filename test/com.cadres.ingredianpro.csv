Ingredients can be flagged for detection in 2 ways: 1 - In one or more diets and 2 - In the master ingredient list.  Please ensure that Carrageenan is unchecked in the Alpha-gal diet AND in the master ingredient list (under Stabilizers).

Product can have ""processed in facility that also handles eggs"" and then app will say that the product contains eggs. Or if you scan a cereal and mentions calories with milk it then shows that the product contains milk. Actually continued using the app over the last few weeks and found it quite useful.

Many Rx drugs (e.g. Lovenox) don't clearly indicate red meat-derived ingredients. There could also be a case where a company alters a drug to include an alpha-gal ingredient without the app ever knowing about it. Including drugs in the app is simply a risk that we are not willing to take at this time.",2019-10-08 08:15:20

An ingredient is available for detection if it is turned on in any diet or in the master ingredient list. Turning an ingredient on/off in one diet will not automatically turn it on/off in other diets or in the master ingredient list.
