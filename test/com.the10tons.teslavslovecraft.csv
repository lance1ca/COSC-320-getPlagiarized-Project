I like it a lot. I wish that they would add more options to choose from for survival mode. My favorite maps from the campaign were big city maps where i could easily level up and just have fun mowing down the enemies. But there is only one survival map and its not so fun. Its like a forest map. The game is really fun and welm worth the money though. Too bad the last update was over a year ago and they likely wont implement anything new.,4,1,1.5.0,2020-12-12 09:04:06,,
