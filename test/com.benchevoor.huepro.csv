The group button at the bottom is used for the brightness slider and toggle button along the bottom. If you want the presets to be for a specific group, edit the preset and change the group from All to the group you want. Then save the preset.

The functionality is mostly there but patting yourself on the back for that is like patting yourself on the back for getting a C+ among a bunch of C-  and F students. I docked one star for the interface.  The other star was docked because I have to use the Tasker app to schedule an animated scene. I am guessing this is due to the lack of an API, but that doesn't matter to the end consumer. The fact remains that I have to use another app to schedule what should be basic functionality and that process is not consumer friendly.  Overall this app is a good effort with potential.

I set up an alarm in the official hue app and imported it into hue pro but it doesn't import correctly. So I set up a schedule in Hue pro with a fade in light (simulate sunrise) and what it does is adds a timer to the hue bridge that turns off my lights at the end of the fade in. Very strange as I would think with an alarm that you wouldn't want this to happen. Also the app could use a UI update as it feels very dated.,3,3,2.2.0,2016-03-04 04:31:19,,

As a stand alone app it's great and has more than enough features. Yeah the interface is hardly material design but I can look past things like that when something works well.  The cons though far outweigh the pros. Firstly, it's very hit and miss as to whether it'll work at all. It just seems to get completely stuck and even though it can see the bridge, just won't work. This is particularly prevalent on the music add on.  It doesn't consider the state of the bulbs, only what IT thinks the bulbs should be doing. So for example, I've got several blooms all also bound to the included Living Colors remote controls. If you use the remote to make any change (or even switch the blooms on), Hue Pro will override that state and switch the light off again. It's VERY frustrating.  As an example, I've got 4 bulbs in lamps in my lounge and there's a schedule to dim them to off at 11pm, starting 30 minutes prior. If however I use a Living Colors remote to switch the lamps off, Hue Pro will moments later put them back into the state of dim it thinks they should be in.  I guess ultimately this is the issue you have when it's not the Bridge doing the control!",2,1,1.9.8,2015-08-07 13:15:11,"Nathan,

I am sorry you feel this way! You nailed the problem; unfortunately Hue Pro cannot know of changes you make to the lights outside of the app. The app can only know of changes made within that app. This will be true with any Hue application. Email me at hueprocontact@gmail.com with any other questions you may have.

I can turn the lamps on and off from any location with no problem.     I can't with this app.   I followed the instructions which had me  forwarding port 80 to the Philips Bridge IP address.   There are two problems with this:  1.  Every time you reboot your wireless router,  you will probably have a new IP address for the bridge, so this will no longer work unless you reconfigure again.    2.   Most Internet companies block port 80,   so it doesn't work anyway.

This problem is probably because your bridge is out of date. Try going into the Philips app and looking for a software update for the bridge. Then try the bridge presets in Hue Pro again. If you're still having an issue, email me at hueprocontact@gmail.com

The other two Hue apps (one of them the proprietary app) I've tried didn't so that's worth stars all by itself.  Second. Widget! I don't really use widgets much, but this is one area where a widget is fantastic. It works well, is easy to configure, and comes with a few options for how many Presets it shows. I'm digging it.  Editing Presets is easy. You can rename, re-order, Group lights and use the groups in your presets. It's so intuitive and powerful.  It's like the app that Hue should have provided.  My only complaint is that I do like the icons from the proprietary app. It might be nice to have that option. But in the end, I guess that's really what the widget is for so... eh.

There are some kinks that need to be worked out, but they are relatively minor and I have no doubt the developer will fix them. Here's a feature request though: I like the wifi detection for turning on the lights, but what about for turning them off when I leave?",5,3,1.0.8,2013-04-18 06:48:07,,

Feature requests: • Time constraints for Wi-Fi detection (don't turn on the lights when I come home at 2 PM)  • Widget to toggle a preset - especially a lockscreen widget!,5,0,,2013-04-15 17:31:23,,

There can be a few more features like for the alarm gradually turning on. Maybe even a better way to control each individual bulb.

It connect very fast and the developer gave me and excellent support,  I personally recommend you to buy this app... Forget about philips support they don't do anything instead the developer of this new app do (Benjamin chevoor) He take care of you guys... Don't waste your time waiting for philips support they don't do anything.  They did a little update 3 months later. It's a shame",5,0,1.0.5,2013-04-13 23:16:54,,

Best designed Hue app that I've seen. And unlike other apps, it has timers for my lights! The wifi detection also works pretty well. I hope they update it with music integration soon. Then it'd be even better!",5,2,,2013-04-10 09:57:57,,
