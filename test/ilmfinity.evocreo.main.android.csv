I was first introduced to EvoCreo on my OUYA. I was looking for a Pokemon-style game and this fit the bill perfectly. I also loved that I could play it on the big screen. Fast forward to today and the game is still wonderful. I am no longer able to play it on the big screen (no Android TV controller support) but the touch controls are easy to use on my phone. That's the 10k foot view from a dad. From my 11yo, she absolutely adores this game. She's a self-proclaimed Pokemon expert and I often find her coming back to EvoCreo as it does a number of things really well. First, the ability to see the strengths and weaknesses of each type simply by tapping on the Creo type while in battle. She finds that super useful. Second, she loves the variety of Creo. Third, the story is good and she feels like there's more to it than simply trying to become a champion. For me, the dad, I'd love to be able to play this on my tv again. It really is a wonderful game and we've enjoyed many many hours of playing it.

Evocreo is a full game with gameplay very similar to Pokemon. In some ways the mechanics are better. You can get healing moves like in standard JRPGs which make a massive difference and moves have to recharge so you can't spam the most powerful move. Overall it's a brilliant game with really creative monsters and mechanics.,5,12,1.9.0,2019-12-15 10:49:08,"Hey, thank you very much! :) 
If you like Pokemon - like games, we see that you also love our Evocreo game and hope that you can play through it and also get to multiplayer. 
By the way - we are working on EvoCreo 2 which will be released this year as well! :)

You get the option of have creo following you or not 2. Creo following you will ride on you head or shoulder if it is small and you are riding a creo 3. Leaving creo at a farm to play or give them to the creo place to take to a farm 4. Your character can do stuff like cook play sleep 5.

Your microtransactions suck. Your endgame also sucks. The game has a lot of redeeming factors but the combat takes a turn for the worst when you realize 3 status effects can be applied to one Monster. It becomes painfully clear as the monsters begin using nothing but status effect moves to prevent you from battling. EvoCreo needs desperately to remove this and have status effect immunities and limit one per mon. This game should have been sold for 5 dollars without all the bull. However, it has broken combat that becomes a chore only an hour or so in. Sorry EvoCreo, you are literally the worst Pokemon/Digimon substitute. 3/5.",3,6,1.8.0,2018-10-16 20:32:02,,

Honestly probably as good as you could get for a mobile touch screen device. The story seems pretty well done thus far. I absolutely loved pokemon growing up. I still enjoy it now. While this game may seem like pokemon. In some aspect it is. I would have to say it is it's own entity. The evolution process is interesting. Being as one Creo could actually evolve differently depending on elemental moves used or special gemmas. I was impressed by the fact that this game is easily playable with out spending actual money. I am interested in the expansions however. All in all decent game. I have a S7 and as I said it's only frozen once. I've played over 72 hours.

The story isn't very immersive, so you can progress through the game at your leisure. One may think of this as a budget clone of other games in the Catch 'em RPG genre, but as I myself learned, this is nowhere near the case. The gameplay has a few mechanics that I find delightful. The stacking of Boons and Conditionss to make them last longer and perform better. The move learning, equipping, and using all have a satisfying difficulty, as not learning a move immediately does not mean you can't use it two minutes from now. The additiomal archetypes to regular typing, known as ""Class"", also put a fun twist on battles, making victory never set in stone just because you dominate the typing game. The only issue I've had is that upon trying to purchase an Alt Creo, the game entered an odd crash state, in which I lost my Prime Gemma and the Alt. I did pay money before hand to get the Gemma, so I was admittedly disappointed. Overall, great story, even if it feels like a prolonged side quest, great gameplay, great Creo, amazing game.

Mysterious organization. Visiting gyms. Challenging elite brokers / trainers and of course capturing Creo is a huge part of the game.  One of the functions that feels like a fun upgrade is being able to see which moves your Creo will learn in advance as it allows you to plan evolutions.   One of the new features that isn't so fun is several Creo have like 7 or 8 evolutions, so you have to capture and train the same Creo over and over to get them all. Its not as fun training the same Creo over and over again. So far it seems like 25 Creo are like this, possibly more.  Love the number of 150 Creo.

The graphics were nice and the variety of creo was good too. On the other hand DoTs in this game are much too strong, if you don't have at least one poison creo in your party you might as well quit.  Poison by far is the strongest stat, my level 20 creo killed a lvl 83 by just poisoning it then healing.  And since this game gives your creo exponentially more exp if you have a large level difference between you and your opponent I went from like level 20 to 38 in one battle. I also didn't find that elemental matching or opposites to be very functional and you don't seem to need to build a strategic elemental creo team. As long as you have creo that can be immune to each element then you're pretty much set. This game wasn't as grindy or challenging as Pokemon and in most cases the DoTs just made it annoying.",3,4,1.5.0,2018-02-10 09:35:59,,

I was like blah I am bored & wanted to buy a game. After checking all other 99 cent games I was like blah. Then saw this was 99 cents. I was like nah this is going to be a waste of money if I can't play the lite version what makes the full version better but I was bored & wanted a game to play so I got this.   Went into settings & set it to performance as soon as I got into the main menu. Then to my disbelief I played this game for a whole hour straight without my phone heating up. I was like wow (no really I was lol) so now going to play this game basically 24/7 lol.   Anyway this is a pretty amazing game after getting into it. Not to mention the graphics are great couldn't ask for better lol. I love the fact you can switch out moves that's pretty great not to mention the abilities for your trainer/main character. That's a pretty neat idea actually.   But basically this is Pokemon for your smart phone & love that & truthfully glad I gave the full version a chance.

The world is beautiful, but I am not thoroughly satisfied with the appearance of the creo themselves, and the world and story are not so large as I had hoped, but still quite sizeable. Also, there is a 'prime gemma' currency mainly used for summoning creo without having to catch them. These can be found in piles, each worth 100, around the world.

Just when I thought I'd lost all faith in app store games, I found this gem. I literally cannot say enough about it. It's like the Pokemon of the past with it's warm and fuzzies, but improved. I am so addicted and cannot recommend this game enough. I don't usually make purchases for apps but this was worth every penny and then some. (Woulda paid full DS game price for this, but no complaints about the low price hehe - shhh don't tell the developers!) I sincerely hope this isn't the end of these kinds of games with stories and subplots and subtle jokes and Pokemon - keep it coming!! Thanks for an awesome game!",5,291,1.5.0,2017-03-31 12:00:54,,

And the SOUND EFFECTS, gosh they're really bad. Like they don't match the situation you're in. For example, if I'm fighting a wild evocreo it would have a normal background music but when it comes to fighting strong opponents it's the same. It gets boring know. Imagine fighting a legendary rare evocreo with the same background music. Gosh that's embarrassing. Lastly is the the BATTLE parts. I suggest making like unique battle cries for when an evocreo is summoned to make the fight more thrilling and fun. It's really boring if they don't have that.

Why did I pay a buck already if I am still going to get bombarded by ads and a disgusting cash shop which includes rare creo & the story?!",1,1,,2016-09-21 23:26:08,,

Loyalty is... a Creo's loyalty to you.

Think of it like this; EvoCreo is to Pokemon what Darksiders II is to Zelda. The core gameplay you love is still there, but with interesting, well thought out changes. You may be driven away by the IAPs, but listen-- you flat out never, ever have to spend a cent outside of the primary purchase. There are 3 items that you can get that give you some sort of ""advantage:"" a (think high IV) basic Creo, level 1. A (high IV) Shiny Creo, level 1. And an item that ""de-evolves"" Creos to their base form. You caught the evolution you already have, want a different one? This item resets it. That's it. Rest is all visual and doesn't impact gameplay at all.  Game is phenomenal. Easily worth every cent. Online trading. Online battling. Most fun I've had with this type of game since White/Black. My only grievances are as follows: 1.) No renaming of ""Creos."" Maybe there's a legitimate DB reason for this, but this is a real shame. 2.) No ""Shiny"" indicator in summary page. 3.) No ""You've caught this already"" indicator.  Easily recommend to any Pokemon fan, or RPG fan in general.",5,2,1.3.2,2015-11-26 01:41:51,,

I love how different the game is with attacks having cool downs and the damage system of elements not oping opposing weaker elements and the world you have created.

While clearly pulling many ideas from other sources and even having several cases of Definitely-Not-Pokemon Syndrome, the game also brings several new twists to the formula such as making some ""Creo"" level up by building up elemental affinity by using moves of that type in battles. Add to this the ability to look up every move a Creo can learn and at what level they learn it in the ""Creopedia,"" and it is very simple to plan out when you want to evolve or wait.  However, there are several notable issues with the game. There are infrequent but noticeable issues with the map and walking through objects or up ledges. Additionally, the ""curve"" of leveling has multiple spikes and dips which leave you grinding for levels or effortlessly blazing through a section. My last gripe would be with the battle AI, which will spam status moves for no reason, such as spamming critical rate boosting skills after their crit rate is maxed.",4,4,1.2.11,2015-08-09 21:02:01,,
