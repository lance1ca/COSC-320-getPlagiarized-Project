I've been a fan since this game used to belong to another developer on Google Play, but their customer service was horribly useless when I got a new phone and I lost the purchases of the other mansions. Never got refunded! All the emailing back and forth with them really traumatized me, but I was willing to pay for it again when I saw it relaunched here under a new developer. Now I can't help but wonder about the free version...?",4,6,1.219,2020-07-12 05:43:27,"Hi, the free version is basically same but with ads in many places. The paid version didn't sell much on Google Play, so we launched the free version to get to more audiences. However, we'd much rather recommend the paid version for optimal experience.",2020-07-12 05:49:44

The hint indeed rolls back the progress from the beginning and progresses 3 steps. The more hint you use, the more steps it progresses, making the puzzle easier to solve. 
Although this is common way of doing hint, I see your point that it may feel like moving you back. We'll consider what we can do for it. Thanks for the feedback.",2020-01-13 18:57:41
