Not as good as the first one. I liked that time is managed differently but it seemed the game didn't have different endings like the first one did.

Seemed like you had very little options. I tried to be neutral and it made you only be good or bad theres no middle. I found the last mini game was frustrating,3,4,1.7.15866,2019-12-15 19:28:38,,
