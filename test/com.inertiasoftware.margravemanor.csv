Still I like that gloomy atmosphere. But I really hate it when I accidentally discover objects when I pan and zoom the screen: it should have some kind of safety lock when two fingers are on the screen... great game nonetheless",5,3,1.0.3,2017-07-19 05:20:54,,

I've already purchased all of them! The gameplay is fairly straightforward but your aren't left with an uninteresting storyline where you're so easily bored with it. I found the music and SFX are very fitting for the main puzzles. Brilliant!,5,3,1.0.3,2016-07-09 12:33:11,,
