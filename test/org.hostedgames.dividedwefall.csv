This story has beautiful and loveable characters, going through one of the most tragic and harsh war within the past 100 years. There are three main characters you shadow and control. Each having there own Unique and Absolutely beautiful story. There are a few glitches though, as if you leave the app during a page where you choose a action. The action is chosen randomly. I've felt so many emotions playing this game, congrats devs!!",5,13,,2019-12-04 16:40:58,,
