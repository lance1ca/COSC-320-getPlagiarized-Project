But why are additional  games so Expensive?,5,1,2.3.4,2017-09-03 13:21:04,"Thanks Paul!  Why?

1) each puzzle takes an author hours to make and cannot be easily ""machine generated"" - we split your payment directly with the authors

2) we don't clutter our apps with ads or spyware - https://eggheadgames.com/blog/2016/3/29/value-is-a-conscious-choice

3) acrostics are a niche puzzle (but shouldn't be!)

Acrostics are fun puzzles and this app is great. The app has lots of options but is very intuitive and well laid-out. You can control sounds within the app, select different puzzle layouts for difficulty/preference, and even change font sizes. Every app has a guide both for using the app and doing the puzzle. Egghead apps NEVER ask for phone permissions for things they don't need, such as location, speaker/mic/camera, or contacts access, you don't need a social media account to play, and you don't need to connect anything to get any perks. I wish more devs would follow their example but I'm overjoyed they do business this way. I found some errors in the Acrostica starter pack and let them know about it; customer service is impeccable.
