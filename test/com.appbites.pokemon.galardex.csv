My only real question for the devs is if they will update the app for both the dlcs when they come out? The isle of armor is out and there is nothing on the app. Edit: The devs are planning on adding the dlc pokedex expansions i just didnt read far enough.",5,5,1.1,2020-10-07 00:16:06,,

App doesn't actually show you pictures of the pokemon, like you can find in other FREE apps. Doesn't give you the ability to Mark if the pokemon has been caught. The app does show you Text information as to where you can find said pokemon but a map would be perfect, especially since you're paying for it. ALL-IN-ALL this is a good and quick way to look up a pokemon found in the Galar Region. Will Make 5* WU.",3,11,1.1,2020-03-29 10:12:06,,
