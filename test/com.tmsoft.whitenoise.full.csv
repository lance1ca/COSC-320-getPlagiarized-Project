It's totally a personal thing, totally and completely.  But I can only listen to my favorite soundbytes ""Rain on Car Roof"" and ""Boat on the Water""(?) for so long, else they get repetitive.

I used to have an app that did that, and it was my absolute favorite, but I got a new phone, and lost that app. I engineered a deeper toned ""pink noise"" that helped me sleep soundly all night. If I could eq the ""AC"" sound to have a deeper tone, or engineer my own ""pink noise"", then I'd be 100% satisfied; though as-is I'm at 98% haha! Regardless, I love this app, and use it nightly with no internal problems! Definitly recommend it!",5,0,,2017-11-11 14:39:27,,

The Market App is ad supported just like the Market website (http://whitenoisemarket.com/)  It's always been that way because ads pay for the bandwidth of all the new sounds we add to the Market.  Once you import sounds into the full version you won't see ads there.  Hope that helps.,2016-07-05 13:12:27

You have no way of seeing which sounds you've already downloaded or which sounds are new. Sounds are sorted by category and ""featured"", how about ""latest""? Nope. A easy way to download a group of sounds or all at once is nowhere to be found.  There's adds on the selection screen and popup adds between every single sound you download, at least half of them are 5 second videos. Plus there's a daily download limit. In the payed version of the app!  Sorting your sound catalogue by drag-drop is practically impossible when your catalogue reach any larger amount of sounds.

I sleep better if I hear good quality ambient noise. I used to turn on fans or humidifier or other electronics. Once I found this app, it's all that I use. Great selection of sounds from both noise to every day types of sounds... some more useful than others (e.g. clothes dryer with coins in it? What the...? hehe). Seamless sound loops which is critical for me.  Had one gripe that I wanted it to have some sounds with different pitches (e.g. chimes w low, med, high). However, most recent release features sound mixing with relative volume & pitch adjustment... VERY handy! Ability to DL more sounds for free is awesome. There are some downloads I consider essential (e.g. rain on tent, rain on deck, bamboo chimes).  Great to pair phone with a bluetooth speaker or through a stereo to fill the room with sound.  5+ stars!! Worth every cent!",5,0,5.1,2013-06-03 14:36:39,,
