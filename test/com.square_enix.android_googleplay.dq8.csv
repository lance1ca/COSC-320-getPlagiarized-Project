I generally always prefer to use it in games where possible. However, having played this portrait is a much more sensible option. When playing on smaller screens, it's better for the characters to use as much screen real estate as possible, rather than the general surroundings. You can easily look around thanks to the handy camera controls at the bottom. Many phone ports omit camera controls as two sticks on the screen is too much. This handy scroll bar solves that and lets you look up, down and side to side easily, which is so important. Secondly, the lack of voices. This is a big deal in general. And I haven't played the original, so I can't say how much of a loss this is. However, I can say that the game has so much character, even without voices, within 5 minutes of playing the personalities of everyone had come through. So, now those two issues have been addressed, onto the good stuff! It's great to get back to some classic, exploration based RPG action with turn based battles and this is one of the finest examples of the genre. A genre which lends itself superbly to touch screens. This game integrates really well, with quickly accessible menus and neat battle controls. The story is interesting, the music first rate and the graphics are beautiful and scrub up really well on HD devices. In particular, if you have a HDR, high contrast display the colours, characters and objects are gorgeous. Highly recommended!",5,12,1.1.4,2017-10-18 16:09:44,,

Give us the voice overs!!   Paid in full $59.99 (maybe more), back when this was first released on PS2. Worked at Funcoland if anyone remembers that place; bought it on the day of its release. That aside, it's an excellent JRPG with old-school game mechanics that made the Dragon Warrior (Quest) the series it is today. This polished gem, while updated for the mobile platform, includes everything the original PS2 version had, minus the voice overs. Being the completionist I am, I'm only half way through, at almost 70 hours of game play! Between the Alchemy Pot and Monster Arena, there's plenty to keep you busy, all the while, leveling your party, giving you an advantage for the main story. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PLEASE SQUARE-ENIX, GIVE THE FANS WHAT THEY WANT! THE VOICE ACTING/OVERS PLEASE!!  DEVELOPMENT ISN'T FINISHED YET! *cough* Maybe a landscape-orientated Guide too...expand into an updated game with controller support...you already have cloud support..that alone, roped in the life long fans such as my self, but we want/need everything that made the original what it was.  ⭐⭐⭐⭐If you love this game as much as I do, you might consider this:  I went as far as to download and organize game maps (images), pictures, FAQs, strategy guides, walkthroughs. Renamed and organized accordingly... all with Google Drive, create a shortcut to the drive folder on my desktop, so I can instantly pick up and continue where I left off.....an added, permanent, plus to accompany the game. (there's other stuff you can do with BLUESTACKS). In summary, take advantage of your devices ""cloud"" saving apps and create your own guides that can sync on all of your devices...just like the game!

The original was widescreen and there's no reason this shouldn't at least have an option to choose.  The controls are a bit fiddly because they tried to make them work with one finger, but in widescreen mode a two finger mode would be just perfect and easy.  (Also, the auto-interact with people is terribly annoying and an all around bad idea.  It's not hard to tap to interact, but it is hard to walk around without people making you stop to talk.)  Second, it really is slow.  It's not just the low FPS (probably less than 15...)  Everything is sluggish and slow to respond.  Even the controls are worse because of this and it's already hard enough to look around and such...  I keep my phone very clean and minimal with very little running in the background, so from my point of view there's no excuse.  BTW, people mention voices.  The original on the PS2 didn't have voices.  I don't know if a later version or another system's version maybe did, but this seems to be just like the one I have on my PS2 in the sound department, just with high-res graphics.

The games FPS is not as good as its PS2 version but its not bad. Loading into battle scenes does take more time than the PS2 version but there again not that bad. The on screen controller is a little clunky to use. The main problem I have with it is it takes longer to get through dungeons because of the tight walking hallways and this also tends to be problematic in towns as well because the circle pad makes you walk but does not control the cam. You have to take your finger off the circle pad to use the slider bar at the bottom to make the cam angle move. It would be nice to use a controller to play the game. The other issue is there is no way to play the game in landscape mode. And there is no voice overs for the char's, but that doesn't really bother me because I always thought that king trods voice was annoying anyways.

I am playing this on the New Nvidia Shield Tablet.  I have run the game on both the internal memory as well as from the microSD card. each has identical performance.  Pro: 1. The in game visuals are very Crisp, well defined, and colorfull.   2. I believe the cell shading has been cleaned up and upscaled for this vers. 3. The option to choose a smaller size for the on-screen analog stick and its location is a very welcome option that was not apparent at first. 4. being able to play offline after the initial license check is a huge plus, if this had been like their always online DRM like older titles I would NEVER have bought it! 5. The portrait view takes a little getting used to but does not feel closterphobic. 6. at least on the Shield Tablet I am getting a consistent pretty smooth 25 to 30 FPS.  Only fast camera changes drop the FPS to the 25 range.   Cons: 1. Cost, even at $14.99 its too Expensive!  Better at $9.99 2. People complained about missing voice acting...

Everyone of your games does this nonsense and it's a crime.   One thing that is pretty consistent in ported Square Enix mobile games is the horrible UIs and controls. They just never fit with the title and this is painfully obvious in DQ8, one of my favorites in the franchise. It's so frustrating to see them not take the proper care in the UI work that they do for the console versions. Examine the platform you are designing for! Make more intuitive UI.  There are certainly some nice ideas in this. The portrait play mode makes some sense and isn't as jarring as I thought it would be and the models are ported well but everything else about this makes it feel like a poor copy of the original instead of a valid port.",1,2,1.0.1,2014-08-06 08:17:11,,

The only difference from the original US version is the lack of voice over and no orchestral soundtrack.  Beyond that, it is the FULL GAME. The main flaws of the actual android port are 1. this game is extremely taxing on the tablet's cpu, so framerate sometimes gets choppy or slows down slightly. I run a 2013 Nexus 7 and the choppiness is negligible, I barely notice it and it doesn't affect my enjoyment. The game doesn't actually slow down at all for me. 2. the controls are rather frustrating given that I played this game on a ps2 before. I also dont like controls on any game for tablets. THAT BEING SAID, they are the best controls ive found on a tablet game. it is somewhat intuitive. 3. almost no settings, so i cant change camera sensitivity or text speed or anything like that. there IS, however sound settings in the main menu, which is nice because standard settings have the music a bit too loud / sfx a bit too quiet.",5,2,1.0.1,2014-06-19 23:51:50,,

Gameplay remains as true to the DQ formula as it was in the beginning: Easy to play, a challenge to master.

On my LG Nexus 4, the game plays without any serious framerate issues and without audio stutter.  Others may take issue with a less than smooth framerate, but it is conceivable that a fix may address that in the future.  As there is no controller support, I am also fine with that; the game can easily be played comfortable with a single hand, as the interface has been redesigned for that in mind.

Like every other Square Enix RPG I have picked up so far, it has a great story line and the gameplay is lots of fun. I was very surprised by how well the touch screen controls worked. An rpg with gamepad support is nice but it isn't needed here. The controls have been setup in such a way that it feels natural, and it controls much better than the touch screen controls on Final Fantasy VI. The portrait mode style gameplay was weird for me at first, but I got used it and oddly it's a little more comfortable as I can actually play with one hand. The frame rate does skip a little bit, but the tiny bit of lag in no way hinders the fun for me personally.

This game needs better optimization though. It takes a while to start up and suffers from frequent frame drops.

So far so good,  the controls will take time to get used to but essy enough to navigate if you have a big screen phone.   Quality of the games cut scene vs gameplay is choppy,  which is understandable given this is a port from the PS2 version.

I think this game does well for touch screen phones... but I feel I am lucky to have a galaxy note 2 considering how low the frame rate is (though still playable but annoying)   In the end I feel you get your money's worth considering a great classic like this is worth playing it is massive and it is lot's of fun love the music but I feel it is slightly degraded on mobile.   the 3 stars out of 5 is for managing to put a massive overall game onto a MOBILE PHONE! I was mindblown to even think this was possible (though it is just skiffing the curb a little with hardware limitations in mobiles)   I highly recommend using a high spec phone for this game as it is VERY VERY demanding! I should know I tried playing this on an emulator on my pc with a good graphics card and it lagged like hell.   ****please patch this game for stability problems and it will be perfection****,3,3,1.0.1,2014-05-29 14:47:47,,

Also, the quicksave option is disabled at the beginning of the game and does not enable until after about 35 minutes of gameplay. This was very difficult for me to get through, but I didn't want to forfeit so I was forced to continue until saving became possible. It doesn't feel like a good choice to force that much continuous play on a mobile device. My biggest gripe is performance.",2,5,1.0.1,2014-05-29 12:13:30,,

I'm willing to pay more for things that I find value in.  This game runs very smoothly on my Nexus 5, but it is a very big file and seems to take a few moments to load initially when starting. Maybe updates will address memory management.  The updated HD graphics are appreciated!   Cons: No voice acting from the US PS2 version.
