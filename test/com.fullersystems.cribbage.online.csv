Just played the updated version. Only one word for it...dreadful! It's now called Brutal at top level. I think it's because you stand very little chance of winning when the computer gives itself hands that never come your way. Difficult to understand how it has the card to score points against each card you hold however you mix it up. I've played cribbage for years and won competitions but with this app I can never get past 48% of wins. As soon as I reach that I start to lose game after game.

When I was young I would watch WWII vets play. The computer hands in this game are really fabricated I've never seen anything like this. Like other reviews there is a problem with high hands from the computer. My guess is they are not using a true cribbage algorithm but have routines to change the game play based on the results of your hand. Fun to play but that's it avoid otherwise.,1,4,2.2.6,2014-05-13 16:05:57,,

No matter your skill level you will not win on these benders. Upwards of 17 in a row very frequently. Don't waste your money on this app unless you like uncontrollable frustration. Also their server has gaps and shutdowns regularly. The new gambling feature is also a scam. The prices charged dont include a percentage they take of the pot.
