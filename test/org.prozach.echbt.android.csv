Now I'm able to use the Peleton app without the need of my phone! Totally worth it! Hoping the developer adds way to costumise it such as being able to expand it so that it uses the lower part of the screen like on the echelon app. Also hopefully they add average stats display and maybe a hr monitor,5,2,1.1,2021-01-15 18:43:42,,

This is a must have if you own an Echelon Sport Connect bike and you want to see your stats on the screen when using the Peloton app. It does the resistance conversion for you based on the Peloton 0-100 scale. No need for two screens anymore. Awesome execution!,5,1,1.1,2021-01-07 14:43:49,,
