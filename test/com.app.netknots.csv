But they left out the list of alternative knots at the bottom of each knot's page.  They have this on their website. The missing lists of any knot's alternatives  makes finding knots in this app a frustrating, futile exercise.",2,8,1.0,2016-09-24 14:17:50,"Really, 2 stars? Seems a bit harsh for all this app has going for it. Also, to find an alternative knot just select the category for what you are trying to do: make a Loop, tie a rope to an object, etc, and there you have a list of alternatives. Really not so hard and certainly not a futile exercise.",2016-09-24 21:42:53
