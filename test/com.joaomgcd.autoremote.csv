Tasker is your app. Autoremote is a welcome extension that enables you to easily communicate between devices. Joao is literally a god with Android dev. Dunno how they do it, but Tasker gets great support, has a huge featureset, and thus far I have yet to be disappointed in any of the plugins they've written. My minor critique: There's probably a bit better of a way to get device registration and such done - the QR code is kind of awk since some devices don't fully support that OOB, and... the link was kind of a pain to figure out how to copy. My suggestion would be enabling a few other options, like NFC or Bluetooth to do this. Anyway, great app, can't find much wrong with it.",5,4,3.1.2,2020-11-14 17:45:50,,

If it rankles slightly that this plug-in's asking price is more than that of Tasker itself, consider that this is more indicative of altruism on the part of the latter's developer than of greed on the part of the individual behind this app.  The documentation is lacking, and the language used to describe concepts and configuration options in the app can be confusing and inconsistent. This is compounded by the fact that third-party articles and tutorials often refer to obsolete versions of the plug-in.  All of this makes for a steep learning curve for the beginner, but the same is true of the underlying Tasker, too.  If you persevere, the clouds will eventually start to part and you'll find yourself adding simple peer-to-peer networking to your Tasker projects.

It rolls controlling your device, SMS messaging from PC and remote security all into one place. I already thought Tasker was immensely powerful but this is like a jetpack on its back!  I've already whipped up some tasks for if I lose my phone, texting from PC and various other random fun things.  I can still think of dozens more uses.",5,0,,2012-08-15 02:19:05,,

I requested a feature of this service, and by the next day it was done! I have _never_ written an app review before, but this was too good to pass up. I highly recommend any of his apps, and I have purchased the ones I use. For the kindness this developer shows, the price is not adequate.  As for the apps, there is nothing else to say except that they work with perfect precision. The apps are truly real-world useful.  This particular app (as mentioned by another online source) is a better match for tasker integration of push messaging than Notify My Android, and is much cheaper. Since the message goes directly to tasker, you can customize what the message does when it arrives, like either popping up a window on the screen, or giving a notification. Alternatively, you can make these messages ""silent"" by having tasker respond to them without a visual notification.  If possible, I will be creating an article detailing the nearly endless possibilities of this when used with a scripting language on a computer.  THANK YOU to João",5,1,,2012-08-07 04:40:41,,
