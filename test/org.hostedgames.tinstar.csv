This game is fantastic, but has continuity issues. In a playthrough I killed Carrie, only to have her briefly appear for some reason later when I met her father, then she was regarded as dead again later. In another playthrough I killed Harry. His brother Larry was owing me money after I demanded a stipend, and somehow later an occasional event I could choose had me collecting on money from dead man Harry instead of his brother. This issues are small but ruin the immersion.",3,0,1.1.6,2021-02-06 23:08:45,,

I love this game and it is amazingly fun and I've already played though it twice but it really could use a better save system. I love the characters and the romances and if I had a better save system one I can access easily without dying I could do so much more! Without having to play the WHOLE GAME OVER. It is really a pain so please all I ask is a better save system otherwise this game is completely and utterly awesome and perfect,5,2,1.0.3,2014-05-13 15:47:46,,
