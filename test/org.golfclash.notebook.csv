It could look a lot better plus maybe some more features like when you practice trying to hit perfect shot I think the ball you choose you should be able to practice with this ball you chosen to practice with. But it's changed my game a lot I am winning tournaments or in top ten all the time. Love this app,5,1,1.5.2,2021-02-04 06:41:58,,

The intuitive design with a userfriendly interface and unobstructive widgets, make it a pleasure to use. Since it has been designed by top GC players (Zack and Ian), it provides you with the required information in the right sized window without distracting you from the game. Now bear in mind that it does take a few rounds of play to get used to as you need to multitask; however, Zack has provided tutorial lessons on his Facebook page to take you through every step. The only feedback I can provide to the developers is to allow customization of the grid like color change or increase/decrease in its opaqueness as the current bright red color is sometimes distracting. So, great job and thanks for making this app that takes all the mundane work of wind calcs out of the game and allows you to be more strategic and accurate in your gameplay.
