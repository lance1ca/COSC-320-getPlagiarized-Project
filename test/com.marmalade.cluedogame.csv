It handles all the fundamentals of Clue well. Single player games can be completed in 10-20 minutes, which makes it a good option for short periods of downtime. The AI difficulty scales gradually, and players of all skill levels should be able to set up a comfortable challenge. The UI is simple and straightforward, with no extraneous dialogue boxes and, more importantly, no ads. The note sheet is flexible, and a few basic notetaking functions are automated, which may be helpful for new players. Online matchmaking takes about a minute. Since I purchased the game in 2017, the developers have taken steps to make the app more faithful to the original. For example, they removed former DLC that allowed players to purchase advantages against the AI. The initial cast of characters is all white, but additional models are available for purchase as DLC. As the global player pool grows, it would be nice to see more diverse options added to the base set. I would also like to see more gameplay variations in the future. For example, the game uses two dice - which makes it easy to move between rooms and keep the pace of the game moving. An option to play with on die would be an fresh strategic challenge. Overall, I highly recommend this game.",5,54,2.7.8,2020-12-27 21:43:37,"Hello Ben! Thank you for your thorough feedback!

On your first turn any roll of the dice will get you into at least a room unless you roll snake eyes (1,1) or a (1,2). The chances of making a low roll of 1 and 2 is only 5.5% chance, yet this game will have you rolling it MORE than 50% of the time? Why are they messing with the random die rolls?

It's not a free game that you would expect there to be in app purchases for anything extra. It's a paid game that gives you just the bare minimum to play and you still have to pay MORE to get anything else. A themed board is $5. A pack with some extra characters is $8. These are prices I would expect to pay if I didn't buy the game itself. There's no way to earn them in game. There's no motivation to keep coming back at all.

And we both love the game. Really does play like the real board game. The only issue and not a minor one ether(why 3 stars) is that when we start a match together it successfully connects but you start to play it can unsink between us randomly and not say. Like she'd go to hall but on my end she went to study. And we realize were not playing with each other no more. Doesn't happen all the time but very annoying.

To see that they have turned a classic board game like clue into a software game for your phone is not only awesome but creative, for it allows for new features and addons to improve and already awesome game even better. I showed my support if you enjoy this app you should too. Many talk about the 34.99 price for the ultimate package, if you add up all that is available for purchase it is a reasonable price being 50% off. Many may feel that this is expensive but when you stop and think about it, you fail to consider that this price includes all current AND future boards, character skins, Etc. This means you automatically get all new addons when new things come out and I can't believe that they have stopped their developing plans when so many new ideas are possible. Eventually you are going to get more for what you originally paid, and you are showing support in the process. In my opinion that's a great deal if you can afford it.",5,1,2.3.2,2018-11-09 23:40:16,,

I kept wanting to swipe around and look at the room artwork but to no avail. Some for of minimal interactivity would spice up these scenes. -Enlarge personal deck when tapped on/hovered over (the cards are small and not being able to see them takes away from the classic board game aesthetic). -Ability to zoom on the map/board. Clicking on the tiny game tiles can become tedious, and it's a shame that we can't explore the 3D renders more. -Actual character models instead of tokens? That's a lot to ask, but I seemed to get more drawn in by the old PC version that included 'real' character models rather than colored tokens. -Ability to turn off auto-fill for clues on the clipboard. Seasoned players might like the challenge of keeping up with clues on their own. -PLEASE reduce the price on the classic theme. I bought the app thinking that I'd be playing with that board/characters, but $7 is a lot to ask after I've already paid to access the app. Lots of suggestions, but I do love this version of the game! Glad to see Clue back on the store! EDIT: I've had this app for many months and the bundle packs are STILL $7 or more. I love Clue and this is a decent app, but without a reward system to earn credit towards the extra content- I find it ridiculous to charge so much for a low poly model of a board and halfway-decent character art. JUST HAVE A SALE OR LOWER THE COST. Or- make the content actually worthy of my $7. Lowering my review score until the developers can show some respect towards their customers (since we already had to pay to USE the app). Hope I can raise my score and afford the Classic Board someday, but I refuse to spend so much on so little content. :/ EDITED EDIT: Y'all just ran a sale for the classic board- so I forgive you. ;) Unfortunately I'd already caved and bought the pack (kicking myself now, since the international characters look fun) but I respect that attempts are being made to make the packs more accessible. 4 stars for now- keep up the good work! 👍",4,2,2.3.0,2018-10-15 21:34:29,,

I have several times hit the wrong box and accidentally deleted what I'd learned but couldn't undo it.

Exactly  like the boardgame. Love the animations, and ease of use of the app. Worth  the purchase. What bugs me though is there were two seperate purchase  prices for Android and IOS, with IOS being double the cost. Second issue is  the in-app purchases. If I've already paid for the app I should not have to  purchase additional things to such a large extent. Of course I don't mind  one or two occasional extras to pay for when upgrading the app, but after  having to purchase it and have more than half the content unavailable  unless extra purchases are made, is not cool. Still, overall I give the app  an A+, just bad about the in-app purchases. Well done development and  design team!",5,4,2.2.5,2018-08-06 12:57:53,,

recommend this game. I have always passed by this game because of the 
original price, until it was on sale for 99cents. This game is just like 
you remember and just as fun with three ways to play; single player, 
online, or with friends. Although I was turned off instantly to find out to 
get other boards and different avatars were available by you having to pay 
more on top of the fee you had to play the game. It's fun for the first few 
games, but after awhile it gets tedious because it takes too long to finish 
a game ( just like the board game). I would be interested in this again if 
there were in-game ways to get other boards, besides paying, and other ways 
to play the game and make it fast and fun for mobile users.",2,0,,2018-07-02 12:16:46,,

We're sorry you feel that way.
The iAPs that we offer are completely optional and don't affect the game play - they are simple cosmetic changes.
To change the difficulty level tap the arrow underneath the A.I. character portrait and select Medium or Hard.

It is a great little game, the controls are a bit irritating since you slide to scroll threw everything, so when you try to tap on things in the game it wants to scroll so they set it up very poorly. Next thing you may want to know is about the in game purchases. This game actually contains with Mrs. White, several different versions of her and all the other character, but you have to buy them. And the characters cost more than the game itself at 2.99 a piece unless you buy the board bundles ranging from 6.99 to 8.99 including the original board, the murder express board, the snowy peaks theme and more. Or for 50% off, so 34.99, you can buy the ultimate detective package, which gives you everything the game has or ever will have. Not bad I guess, I feel with in game purchases the base app should be free, but anyways, the one huge issue I have with the game, aside from the controls, is the lack of information about it. When you get into the game you collect some daily rewards, but after 14 games over 3 days and have collected 55 of these silver coins and not one word on what they are for. They aren't used to purchase things or in game nor do they seem to have anything to do with your score. It is an addictive little if you can get passed the bugs, hopefully they add more and do something with the terribly unresponsive touch screen, but you have to make that desition yourself.",2,4,2.1.0,2018-04-10 03:32:28,,

You can buy the classic board seperate but I don't know if it ended just one die. The $2 games is more of a mobile app version where you almost never end up walking from room to room. You just use the dice to determine what room you can reach.  I don't totally like that & I don't know if I want to spend that kind of money on different skins to find out. Last​ I play this solo to kill time so I just don't buy the hint cards they sell.  If played in a group I hope they would disabled all together.  I do wish I could disable the hay try one for free too.  Passing it among friends in a line it would kill time nicely too if that were the case. Otherwise it's a fun little time killer of one of my favorite classic board games I otherwise wouldn't get to play. So complaints​ listed it's worth a 4 star and $2.,4,0,2.0.5,2018-02-20 12:47:12,,

I play mostly against the computer. Tried multiplayer before I really understood how to play and the timer was alittle annoying when you're trying to figure it out...and it kicked a player or they left the game without it telling us. But hey multiplayer is still pretty new. The additional charecter options and boards are beautiful and honestly worth the money to buy them all at once (and it gives you any that get added as well with that option)  I look forward to increasing my skill at my favorite classic board game without begging my family to play with me.,5,1,2.0.3,2017-12-31 20:17:53,,

Today I moved up to ""Hard"" and first game was a breeze. Second game with the settings at ""Hard"" I found many glitches. First of all, a computer guessed the culprit after one single round. Tried it again and suddenly everyone's game pieces are moving around from room to room in between turns. I would do my first turn in the Ballroom, and after one other player goes, suddenly someone else's piece is in the room even though they haven't even rolled yet. Or I would enter a room, let's say the conservatory, and when it comes around to my turn, suddenly I'm starting in the kitchen. Also, the computers are able to select the same room they are already in, and yet I'm not.  Don't even get my started on the many glitches in multiplayer. Love the game but it feels like a waste of my money since the pieces glitching to other rooms has happened 7 times now.",3,0,2.0.2,2017-12-14 21:01:50,Hello thank you for your review.

I take 1 star off since cosmetic items are a big deal, otherwise they wouldn't be so expensive. Another star off for the online hint system. People who have purchased hints have a slight advantage on people who don't have. To make it completely fair the game should have no hints or the same amount of hints for everyone to speed up the game. Sure there is a limit of 3 cards per game but still, one of those cards gives you a free player/weapon/room to eliminate. That alone can til the odds. Now imagine someone who uses all 3 cards in a single game. That's potentially 3 things they can eliminate at the start of the game. Again, this is for online, it doesn't matter for offline since you okay with AI but when playing with people it's just not fair. 3/5 stars.

My only issue is that you can't have multiple human characters. My best friend wanted to play this with me and she couldn't because there was no multiplayer option. At least add it in where more than one person can play on the same device together. I don't think it would be hard to add that feature in. And all the characters and things you guys have are really expensive and taking Mrs. White out as one of the original game characters wasn't a good move. I like the game but I'd like it a whole lot better if you fixed the issues I described. Especially the multiplayer issue. I didn't read the reviews on this app before buying it because I know people can be unfair in their reviews. After buying this game I looked through the reviews and it turns out most everyone who rated it badly had a right to. I paid 2.99 for this game thinking I'd get the classic clue game and be able to have some fun with it with my friends. But to my disappointment that didn't happen unfortunately and I am considering getting a refund because I expected much better than what I got,3,0,1.5.0,2017-11-11 11:14:29,,

For showing a card to disprove another player's suggestion, the phone show a player who can disprove the suggestion. Pass the phone to the player so that they can pick a card to show.

It is true if you want different character packs or board you do have to pay. But you get a board and full character packs with purchase of game anyway so it's not necessary to buy anything else though. Also the people complaining you have to buy hints.....Why shouldn't you ? That's a special item plus you don't get to buy hints in real life clue. You get ""hints"" so to speak ,from you making suggestions anyway. Plus you get hijt cards as login bonuses so what's to complain about ? I mean if you just want to use hints and specials to win what's the point of playing?  Also I have no problem playing and winning this game even on hard mode. The people who are having trouble I don't understand it. It plays the same as the regular game... if no one has the card it clearly must be on of the murder cards, you don't have to wait until everything is crossed off your list. That's the only way I could see the ones claiming they can't win, actually not winning.

After delving deeper into what I actually had I realized there is no option for multiplayer, which would really make this a lot more fun.

The detective notepad is really well done; the app automatically marks an X if a player does not have a particular card and a checkmark if they do.  So it helps you to keep track, not only of the cards other players have shown you, but also of the cards that they don't have.  After each player's turn, you have to tap the ""Continue"" button before the next player's turn, which gives you as much time as you need to jot down what you just learned before moving.
