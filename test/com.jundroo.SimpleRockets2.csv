The new programing update was the last thing I wanted to see on mobile. We need better controls. Or needed. I'm done. PC is where you should play. Avoid the mobile version for now. I have all their games and they patched them to completion. I think this one went out too early. The port from PC to mobile didn't go so well. SERIOUSLY FLAWED MOBILE TOUCH CONTROLS.. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT A KEYBOARD. It's a frustrating mess on the mobile side and I just barely recommend it for tablets but it's a flat out AVOID playing this on phones. Touchscreen controls on tablets are horrible especially in the map The view and plot controls will fight you all the time. Forget tiny movements. Fine movements are simply not possible as you will rocket past where you wanted or the camera just wont let you see what's going on near planets and the orbit controls can block each other so once again you have to move and start over, and over, and over. Docking controls are the worst I have ever seen in a space game. Seeing distance from surface is equally difficult with micro dot like text. Camera does whatever it wants and can make whole planets vanish on the map screen. Lots of waiting in loading screens over and over while trying to fix a stage that breaks when your loaded onto the pad. Far as I know there is no pre test for this stupid feature. Building rockets is also a bit of a mess when duplicating large craft. Pull a big section off and it will auto lock and auto mirror that section crossing nodes. Couple hundred part section can lock up the game for a long while as it builds 1000 parts. Catching a few nodes over and over is frustrating. Build a staged craft and adding to another staged craft combines all the same number stages so you have to pull those out and fix it. Forgot playing on your phone. Rest of the game is awesome but that map portion was clearly meant for a computer and ported to mobile. Even the instructions have keys for the functions. Still having fun with everything else. I'd say get the PC version but it just doesn't have the legs to keep up with KSP there. SR2 can't decide if it wants to be a PC or mobile game and the mobile versions is suffering because of that. LOVED SR and SP. SR2 is good. Too good. At lest for phones. Just not enough screen and tablets are not much better. The map. It will fight you at every turn deciding which view it likes best. Place a nav point. View switch. Del nav point. View switch. Move the view around your rocket or planet and hit a invisible wall. Go out and come back. View switch. Touch controls seem like an afterthought. Plotting a intersection point is a game of stop at just the right time as it decides to move in micro increments then takes off and you play the back and forth game just trying to get your intersection right. Control settings are mainly for keyboards so no help there. It's a PC game ported to mobile now. Downloading crafts has a huge following and good ideas. Just about all the good ones are Windows only or not mobile friendly. SR2 is AWESOME but aimed at the PC with KSP in it's cross hairs but it has a LONG way to go to replace KSP which is what I play on my PC. Good game but I want my SR mobile experience back. SR2 is too good for mobile and not good enough for the PC competition. I hope they decide which way they want to go with SR 3. Mobile or PC because right now it's stuck in between.1 STAR for this mobile mess. 2 stars because I loved SR1 and SRP. SR2 looks amazing but needs a lot of work on mobile. It's simply not suited for mobile. WAY better on PC.",1,29,0.8.402,2020-01-27 20:41:57,,

I've spent countless hours in it just building and I can honestly say the limits are almost endless as to what you can build. Great graphics and a very welcoming community. And oh yes, plenty of rocketry fun! Go to Luna (moon) or Cylero (Mars) and see if you can put your own rover there, with your own rocket. The feeling when you first do this in this game is amazing! Much potential for many updates in the future, the devs are constantly adding new features and parts. 5/5!",5,48,0.8.107,2019-09-19 05:54:40,,
