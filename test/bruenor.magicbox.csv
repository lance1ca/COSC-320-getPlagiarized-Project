Highly recommended over others!  I recently got a new, more powerful phone so I figured I'd try out DOSBox emulation again. I loaded up my previous go to app and was disappointed in the performance. Not only that but the custom virtual buttons wouldn't register more than one at a time. The performance bugged me the most as I used to run DOSBox on my old Windows XP laptop and it ran better than a quad core modern phone.  So, I went looking for a new app and saw someone mention Magic DosBox. Never heard of it but there was a free version to try out so I gave it a shot. A little confusing at first but the help tips got me through the interface options. And I was blown away at the customization options and the improved performance. THIS is what I expect a modern DOSBox app to be like! Being able to tweak settings and control layouts for every game is beautiful. The layout and controls for a platformer are very different to a pinball game.  Magic DosBox was an instant buy even from the limited free version options. Now I have total control over any DOS game I want to play. Keep up the great work bruenor!",5,3,1.0.46,2017-01-09 09:01:59,,

Previously, I've used WinUAE, which has worked, but normally the interface ends up clunky at best. With MagicBox, for almost every game I've tried so far, that interface is beautifully smooth. It perfectly emulates 'Bards Tale', 'Menzoberranzan' and 'Strahd's Possession' (the three I've tried at length so far).   In fact, it does better than just repeat the functionality of the original: you can create your own on-screen keyboard, combining multiple actions at a touch. So, in 'Bards Tale', rather than laboriously hitting c for a spell, selecting the character, typing out the spell code, hit return, select where I want to cast it etc, I can do all that with one click. Amazing.  The only problems I've run into up until now are dodgy mouse emulation when trying to play 'Battlemaster' (perhaps due to the age of that game) and some issues with the CD on Daggerfall. MagicBox seems happy enough to install from CD and it will load if I then immediately go into the game from there, but attempting to run the new install off the main MagicBox screen brings up 'can't find CD' errors (though that's could be an issue with the game rather than MagicBox).",5,0,1.0.14,2014-09-12 02:29:52,,

So far, every game I've tried on this runs at least as fast as DBTurbo, with most of the games running even faster. The mouse movement is superior. It's very smooth and precise. I have yet to experience even slight pointer lag. But it's shining feature is the the custom widgets. They offer so many control options. You can use them to set up buttons with assigned keys or macros anywhere on screen, all of which can have your own text labels (or even custom images as icons) and can be resized and moved individually. So far I haven't run into a limit to how many I could add, which is very useful if you play the old school RPGs that use a ton of keyboard keys (I set up 26 around the edges of the screen for Ultima 5). There are several additional widgets that add other really nice control options as well. Highly recommended for any classic gamer.  I also wanted to add that the developer was quick to respond and very helpful when I emailed him about an issue I ran into (which simply turned out to be a wrong setting on my part).",5,0,1.0.8,2014-07-06 15:41:19,,
