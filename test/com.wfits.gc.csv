I like the interface.  The only thing that is that you always have to remember to hit the save icon after each entry.  I didn't have to do that with my last app so sometimes I forget.  The developer is very helpful and responsive if you have an issue!  Thanks for a great app!,5,2,1.26,2019-01-28 05:46:13,,
