To be specific;   the UI animations are slow and obnoxious. I'm not here to see/hear your interpretations of what this game would look like if it were a cartoon. I want a streamlined, fast version of the game to play, with a gentle balance of showmanship.   The menus where the options ""collapse"" into view? Ugggggggh.  It takes an eternity for a base to finish scoring, and it doesn't even make it entirely clear where all the points are being added to/from, unless you analyze the event-history.   The ""press-hold-and-drag"" method of thumbing through cards is extraordinarily difficult to to use.  Many of the mechanics do not exercise common-sense while resolving. For example, a Wizard card permits me to draw minions from the top-five of my deck. The UI forces me to click on *every* card (including ones I can't draw) and select an action for them. I don't even like to play these cards for this reason.   I would pay an additional 5 dollars for a stripped down version of the game, without the stupid animations, and a greater focus on quality-of-life features.

There doesn't seem to be any way to inspect actions that have been played on minions to see what the card text says. Figuring out what just happened is also a pain - Although there is a play history it only has the name of the cards and doesn't show the card that was just played, meaning I'd have to memorize the names of the cards and corresponding card text to be able to make sense of the history. You can view an opponents discard pile but it's not clear in what order, If any, the cards are displayed in the discard pile. On mobile the card icons on bases are very small (I have a galaxy s6, which has a decent sized screen) which means it's often difficult to select a card that has been played on a base to destroy it, etc. I'd consider buying it for PC, but it's $15 for PC which might have less issues with small icon size - I'm not sure I want to pay 3x the price for an app I just bought for another platform when it has the other issues I just mentioned.",3,0,1.07.1,2017-10-13 07:30:55,"Hello,
