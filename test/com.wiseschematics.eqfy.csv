I am an audiofile and was looking for something that worked specifically with Spotify (although this works with any media source). This was exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend anyone who wants a real EQ consider this rather than spending hours and hours testing alternatives that just don't work. I open Spotify and I have Eqfy auto-start. Very easy and intuitive. I just bought 500 watt speakers and play my tunes with Spotify and Eqfy. Eqfy really improves the richness of the sound of these speakers. It is very noticeable.

A 10 band EQ is always welcome. Closest app I can get to sounding like Poweramp. However it's still quite buggy, often forgets custom presets (chosen but levels are reverted back to default (have to select another preset then go back), sometimes changes in bass boost doesn't happen dynamically, so app has to be toggled via the tick box. Really dislike how the volume gets drastically lowered when using custom EQ. Adding gain addd distortion to multiple speakers. Need the ability to rename the custom presets. Also due to the nature of EQFY needing to launch after a media app, it didn't work well with Android auto in phone mode. Also a shame there is no free trial for this app. I'm happy to pay for apps but don't like paying to discover in not 100% happy. Otherwise it's good so far, could be great.
