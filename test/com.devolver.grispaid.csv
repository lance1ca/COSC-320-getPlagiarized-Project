The game can be played in Windows, macOS, Nintendo Switch, iOS, PlayStation 4 and recently, Android. Gris will remind us all again that video games are ART. Every step of your character takes will make you stop to appreciate the beauty of the art. Better prepare your screenshots—or much better, screen recorder with AUDIO (very important). STORY: 9/10 The game does not have any words or conversations for you to know what is happening. The colors, scenery, movements, and music are enough to deliver the message throughout the game. In the introduction, you will notice Gris's facial expression is somewhat sad and broken. There are no colors around her but black and white, thus giving you the impression of loneliness and longing. Although, there are parts that'll give you confusion like the little box creatures in the forest. GRAPHICS: 10/10 One word: ART. The scenes are painted with watercolor. As you progress through the game, you will encounter colors that give life to every scene in the game. For example, the first color to be encountered is RED. Almost, everything—even the sky—is painted with red. Red is an emotionally intense color. Gris might have felt very tensed or hurt from the very start. Then you will encounter other colors. As each color appears, you will begin to grasp Gris's emotions and her mission in the story. Be careful when playing in high brightness with your screen because of the colors from the screen are too intense for the eyes to take. Remember to take care of your eyes. So remember to know what each color and shape symbolizes because it will be very useful ANIMATION: 10/10 The animations are again: ART. Everything about this game is art. The animations are fluid and mesmerizing. Every frame in the animation will make your heart stop. Smooth animations in every small detail in this game is amazingly superb. The fishes are well-animated no matter how small they are. The same goes for the flower petals down the smallest particle. Even Gris's cloak is very well-animated. The transition of color in this game is so smooth and you could feel every color blending in. It's like you're not just playing the game also painting every step of the way. GAMEPLAY: 8/10 The gameplay is really simple since it is a platform adventure game. You need to solve puzzles and collect stars to complete a mission or get a new skill. At first, it seems like the usual run-and-jump platform adventure game but there is a lot of twist to it. Gris will receive different skills as the game progresses. There are a lot of puzzles in this game and each puzzle is unique and outstanding. What I don't like about it is that there are no hints for the next mission or what to do next. You pretty much have to guess everything by yourself on what to do first. The jump height for the gameplay is too short but later on, the game will give you a double-jump skill. OVERALL: 9.25/10 I have so much to say about this game but I want you to experience it. Just like the game, there are no words to explain it but the emotion that you feel says it all. Gris is such an amazing game and one of the best games that I've played this year.",5,14,1.0.0,2020-04-05 09:39:05,,
