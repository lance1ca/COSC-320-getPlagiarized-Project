I was playing iwd since my Pentium 3. The thing is I bought this game on my galaxy s7 and it was fine. Now I got galaxy s10 and the game won't play correctly. Bottom buttons don't work even if there is sound when I press them. I guess is compatibility issues but either fix it or refund. And I got an answer. Create acc to zendesk to report the problem. Then create an acc to another site to report the problem again. They just complicate this so they don't FIX the issue or refund.,1,17,2.5.17.0,2019-10-07 11:13:32,"Thanks for the feedback.

You guys did a great job with this! For those who haven't played Icewind Dale before, this is a fantastic RPG with a quality story, good voice acting and game mechanics which you can really sink your teeth into. Well worth paying for, trust me! I understand this can be played on a phone, but I wouldn't advise it because the interface would be tiny. Looks fantastic on a tablet though - just make sure you have over 2.5gb free space, this is a BIG game. To those who know Icewind Dale from PC, you will not be disappointed. The controls and interface translate remarkably well to touchscreen and a few extra buttons have been added to make certain things easier but gameplay is almost totally the same and it looks great on a hi-res screen. A quality conversion that makes me want to buy more titles from Beamdog 😊 *Playing on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A6, runs perfectly",5,1,1.3,2017-10-11 11:18:26,,

If you like isometric pc rpg and haven't played this yet or you want to play again I highly recommend this game.  $3 for potentially hundreds of hours of gaming.  Character and party customization is nearly limitless.  Uses 2nd edition DnD rules and beautiful old school 2d sprites.  Only issue is it can be hard to read on small displays at high res and a stylus is almost required.,5,195,1.3,2015-12-27 00:38:39,,

I am using a Nexus 10 with the latest Android update and find that I have to restart my tablet in between playing sessions. Whenever I close the app and subsequently restart it, many of the icons fail to register my selecting them. Playing becomes impossible because the user interface is non-responsive without a power-down and restart of my tablet. It would also be nice if the screen and interface adjusted for display size. Selecting npcs to talk to becomes a chore because finding the sweet spot to select them is guesswork. Another issue is spell icons in your character's tomes are not labeled so I never know what spell I'm selecting from the quick pick or spellslot allocation sections. This makes surviving combat especially difficult since selecting the right spell for the situation becomes guesswork as well.",3,8,1.3,2015-12-25 09:13:19,,

This release, like the baldurs gate ee for android, feels like it was almost ment for touch.  This game benifits from the engine enhancements and refinement from the patches to the Baldurs Gate ee android release like ""Quick loot"" as well as some new ones (which will be back ported to baldurs gate), new class kits, a small amount of cut content, both expansion packs, and so on. Fans of druids and bards rejoice, the changes from reg IWD have been carried over.",5,11,1.3,2014-10-30 10:18:13,,
