Also you need to pay for every single picture to take the tag off the photo, which to me is ridiculous. Apparently there is another version that you dont have to pay for the tag off, but I dont have an iPhone so I cant get it Looked at past reviews who say similar things, and it seems the developer is always promising that these bugs will be fixed..
