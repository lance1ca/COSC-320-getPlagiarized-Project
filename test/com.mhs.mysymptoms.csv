Incomplete Food Database: I tried scanning three different kinds of coffee and 4 different kinds of breakfast cereal and none of them produced a result.

Problems: It does crash on occasion (Android 5.x Nexus 7) and it seems to do so more often when the app is brought from background to foreground. This seems to be avoidable if you always close out of the app.  Need improvement: 1)Symptoms. Seeing as how you could register anything else, I was surprised to see a fixed listed of symptoms (only 9!) and it doesn't even include constipation for instance, a very common food related symptom that accompanies many conditions. They really need to make symptoms editable!  2) Cache food ingredients that are frequently used! Once convenience is that dishes and drinks that you consume regularly are remembered in a seperate tab for easy adding. However, if you are like me and 1. have a strict diet to follow and 2. can't eat out and don't cook according to recipes, then every time I cook, I use a slightly different combination of the same ingredients. Unfortunately, when adding ingredients to a dish, a process identical to adding a drink or dish to a meal, they don't have a list of frequently used ingredients. I only have a list of 20 I use, but I type in every meal...:(",3,0,4.4,2014-12-23 20:32:29,"Hi Chris. To add your own symptoms go to Organizer &gt; Symptoms and then tap the + button.
