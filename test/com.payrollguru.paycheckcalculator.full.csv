Which I can understand because of the higher and different tax bracket.  But when it comes to regular 40 hours its like 1 or 2 dollars off.   So as long as your not calculating down to the last dollar or for over time the last 10-20 dollars.   You will have a pretty close estimate of what you are going to get.  Its worth the money to buy it. And im glad I spent the money     Just edited it it keeps freezing servers ar,1,0,2.3,2013-07-20 16:48:19,,
