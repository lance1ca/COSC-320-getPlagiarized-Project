These guys are now my go to for apps. Excellent graphics and I love that I can choose what deck of cards, if my oponents picture is displayed and the background colour. Lots of different level AIs that I have yet to try out.   Very fast, doesn't suck up my battery and I hasn't needed a force close. Only after playing the game for maybe an hour nonstop does it slow down for a few seconds, but it goes back to it's normal speed.   Highly recommended and well worth the money.",5,0,1.101,2012-06-08 17:24:25,,

The AI is decent, and I like having a choice of levels of AI strength.  I've tried several of the hearts on the market, and this one was the best; I kept playing the free version so I decided to finally upgrade to the paid version.

Same basic interface as their Spades game, but a bit more mindless since I don't have to figure out how many tricks to bid. ;)  The thing I *really* like about the for-pay versions of their games is that they get rid of all of the networking permissions, which means that it's a much safer investment. I don't have to worry if the company is selling my private information as has been found in other apps.",5,6,1.03,2011-10-06 09:59:47,,
