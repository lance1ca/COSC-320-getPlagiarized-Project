wood. Output: green goods. (Green goods crates) Construction Facility

Two glaring mistakes in its design is the absence of a scenario wide map. Would make strategic route planning more efficient. Also I would recommend a scenario without too much topography. IMO route planning is much easier than grading topography. So a scenario with emphasis on route planning would be an excellent stepping stone before one enters into topography management. As It is, since I am just trying to figure this out by rote (the instructions and tutorials are not very helpful, and contain nothing about topography grading). I spend an hour of playing time just attempting and failing miserably at this. I am going to keep plugging at it and hopefully figure it out.

None of these levels are good. It should be possible to zoom inn and out as much as I please with two fingers pinch. 3) The different layers of the minimap is not customizable (shows you only all or nothing). 4) It is not possible to sort industry/towns based on production/population 5) The building is utterly horrible, it takes forever to build a long stretch of railroad/road since you have to build every tile of railroad/road separately.

Game is laggy in places, load times are quite long. I tried this first on my Nexus 7 (2012) not very playable. Installed on an old Acer Iconia A500 and also a Galaxy Note 10.1. Much easier to play on the bigger screened device. Graphics look nice until you zoom in to a level you need to build stuff, then the cracks start to appear. It looks like an old isometric Commodore 64 game, badly pixellated which makes it difficult to play. The building controls are straight out of Locomotion, love them or hate them. Even the original Transport Tycoon music has been rejigged through a better set of MIDI instruments - doesn't sound quite right now.   I've seen a bunch of graphical glitches where bridge sections flash when vehicles are near them. You can't zoom out enough either to say be able to view two nearby towns in order to plan a route. It's a good start but seems to have been rushed out of the door. Hopefully 31X and Chris Sawyer will carry on working on it and fix these problems",2,4,0.8.1002,2013-10-03 04:42:04,,
