Have had a couple puzzles where I think I've tried every possible permutation on the board, and it just keeps going wrong move, wrong move, wrong move. When you give up, you don't find out what the solution actually was. You feel as if it's just been taking the mickey. Other than that it's pretty good",4,1,1.3.9,2021-02-02 14:22:43,"Thanks for your review. You can actually see the solution just use the > and < buttons from the bottom toolbar under the board.

I believe ""hint"" has the side effect of artificially increase the ELO and hinders progress; you can try engine analysis instead to improve your tactical sharpness with what if scenarios aka variations.
