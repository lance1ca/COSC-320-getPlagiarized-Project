I thought signing in with Facebook would allow me to challenge my friends who also have the app installed but so far you can only play against computers. * Show how many points you have on the leaderboard somewhere.

The sound effects and music really add to the charm of the game and make it a joy to play. If you enjoy this brilliantly simple card drafting game, I highly recommend you consider picking up the tabletop version. There are a few errors with some of the stray cat cards: Moonbeam - Moonbeam's ability states ""Moonbeam grants 2 wild food"". This is incorrect and varies from the tabletop's ability, which states ""You may use any 2 food as wilds"". The original, and correct, ability allows you to use any 2 existing food as wilds, whereas the app's ability incorrectly gives you 2 wild food for free. Penny - in the app, Penny is a black cat. She should be an orange cat. This error will affect the balance of the game. Truffle - the first sentence of Truffle's ability states ""feed Truffle 1 chicken, tuna, milk"". This suggests you must feed her one of each food type. This is wrong. The correct text should read ""feed Truffle 1 chicken, tuna, or milk"". She must be fed only one item of any one type of food.",5,8,0.0.21,2018-10-23 06:04:38,"Thanks for the great comments, we're thrilled you're enjoying Cat Lady!
With Moonbeam's ability, to keep Cat Lady flowing as smoothly as possible we opted to have Moonbeam grant 2 wild food rather than requiring the player to manage which food they want to use at any given time.
We'll get right onto fixing your other two points though, thanks",2018-10-23 07:40:53
