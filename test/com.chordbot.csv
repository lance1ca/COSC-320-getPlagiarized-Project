I would really like the addition of a place to put a melody line as I'm working on chords. A single piano roll track would suffice, nothing too fancy, it's just for keeping track of things.   The other thing I'd like to see is I would like it if the chord blocks took up the space of the amount of time they represent. For instance, a chord that is eight beats takes up twice the amount of room that a four beat chord would take up. This would help phrases line up better, and improve readability.

I use this on my Samsung GN 2 for sketching out song ideas when I don't have access to my keyboard. Just one request. .. would it be possible to have the inversion of each cord displayed in the main window rather than having to open the cord editor to see it. This would be helpful for reviewing the relative pitches of the chords all in one place. Maybe just add an 'R'' 1' 2 etc with a + or - for the octave in the bottom right corner of each chord name.
