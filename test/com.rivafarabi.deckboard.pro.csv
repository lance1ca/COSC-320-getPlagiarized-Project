Both the desktop and mobile parts of the app are super easy to use and highly customisable. The only reason for 4 stars is there seems to be no option to disable having your phone display on permanently while the app is open. Phones or tablets with OLED screens will suffer burn-in after short use of this app unless you manually turn your screen off when not using it. The big problem with that is if you turn your screen off then the app goes to 'sleep' and when you turn the phone screen back on the app takes a while to reconnect to the desktop client. For the full 5 stars, I would like an option where the app fades to an all black screen after 30 seconds or a minute so that the screen is still technically on but will not damage an OLED screen and a simple tap of the screen will show your buttons again. The black screen would have to be set as a 'full screen' mode too in order to hide the notification bar which would also burn the screen if left there. Hope this can be added, I'll happily change to 5 stars if it does.",4,2,1.9.80,2021-01-17 07:26:28,,
