The practice part is impossible...how the heck can you even come close to stopping the moving target in the basket...pretty much impossible to ever complete any of the events so that totally blows. Also recruiting takes way to long and is not fair at all. can you add a option to slow down the practice moving target and also 8 out of 10 times when i hit the button to get a ball i just have to keep tapping several times so the time usually runs out way before i can even get close to completing the practice session this is really frustrating especially when i paid for the app and also paid an aditional $6.99 as well and the app does not work correctly. If you can fix the practice part I would give 5 stars or at least add it in the option screen to slow down the target for slow people like me. Will you be doing a football one as well and maybe a NBA would be fantastic.,3,3,1.3.07,2018-11-27 08:23:09,,

What I would suggest is that you should scale down the ratings so you can utilize the ""potential"" and ""defense"" more. I've had players with 5 potential that would grow more than a player with 10 potential. So what I would suggest is that you should down scale all recruits way lower so that they actually grow into great players because its more realistic that way. It will even utilize a new part of the game where you can find gems in a deep sea of recruits. I wouldn't just throw around the ""10 overall"" potential as in it would grow players to 10 overall. The defense stat is completely useless. When you go up against another great team it becomes a barnburner of a game. Its pretty much a race to who gets to 120 points first! You should make it tough for a player to get to 10 because that player should impact the game dramatically. A player with 10 offense should be that 40 points a game player as long as he was a relitively consistent player. So what I would suggest is that you start recruits stats alot lower so they arent so godly.  The draft isnt special at all due to the fact that there is 100+ 10 overall players so the scaling should easily be able to fix that.  There should be an absolute undisputable way to win the cup. I've had a team of mostly 10 overall players and lose to some random team because they had one good player that scored 45 points when all my players score 6-20 points each MAX because there is to many good players to match one good player. There no way this should happen when your team has very good defense?  All this would be fixed with downscaling the great recruits to 6 or 7 so they would grow each year on their potential or a super rare occasional 8 that everyone is trying to recruit.  Or maybe on a different note you could increase player rating to be out of 100 instead of 10 so it doesnt look so repetitive?   Please try these changes as in would make the game easier to be successful and realistic!",4,8,1.2.07,2017-02-09 14:07:16,,

What I realized is that with an all 10 team is all 10 of my players are fighting for the points and I end up averaging just about 100 points a game doing this BUT if you even your roster out to have a couple 10s 9s and 8s it results in the most likely way to win the championship and when I have it setup this way I average 105 to 107 pts per game on the year. However nothing is guaranteed and you will not always be able to win it all. I have played probably 30 plus seasons on different teams trying out different methods and I have the most consistency with having a well rounded out team rather than all 10s for anyone wanting to win more championships! Great game guys I am addicted to this game! Oh and also 1 thing I really don't like is how if I am the players first choice team and have well over 2 or 3 hundred recruiting points than the next team they still don't pick me sometimes they do and sometimes they don't I feel like it shouldn't be this way though,5,3,1.2.07,2017-02-07 20:44:37,,
