This app helps...Alot! Yes there are improvements to be made, which have been suggested in the review below, but it does what it says for the most part. Definitely makes the game more enjoyable. Thank you. Would love to see the app match the colors of the board game :)",4,2,2.1.0,2020-09-06 23:19:53,"Thank you for your review.  Regarding the appearance of the tiles, I do not think I can use the exact tiles legally so I use different ones that are still easy identifiable.  I would have prefer the same ones too.",2020-09-07 12:26:26

Doesn't follow the minimum zero rule; no names of players; no save features; no separate records per round; making mistakes while recording minuses can be disastrous. Looking forward to future updates, and thanks, developer for your work so far.",3,3,2.0.0,2020-07-27 12:02:38,"Thank you for your comments, I will look into those features.",2020-07-27 10:44:47

A couple of quick checks: Column of 4 should score 4, not 10. Bonuses for columns should be applied only at the end of the game, not before. Please fix it, would be very handy. Just read the rules a few more times!",1,1,,2020-05-25 07:59:55,"That is a harsh review considering the scoring is correct.  A column of 4 is depending on the order you place the tiles and cannot be 4.  When you place a tile, the vertically and horizontally adjacent tiles also gives points.  Here is a link explaining how to calculate the score:
