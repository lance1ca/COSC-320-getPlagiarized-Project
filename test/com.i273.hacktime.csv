I'm on my 2nd play through and I even used the answer function to see if I was doing something wrong. The correct dialogue ensues, but no message to notify that the level was completed. I believe this to be a glitch.",4,4,1.0.1,2019-12-04 01:23:10,,

I also like that in-game websites were used more than in previous games. The voicemails are okay, but I hate the texts since you can't get back to them if you forget to put them in your notes. Overall, another good game!",4,3,1.0.1,2019-07-04 20:36:38,,
