Even heard a few replies in real time which doesn't always happen in the best of sessions. Pretty clear audio. Runs on automatic the whole time so there's no sweep rate adjustment. Helps create plenty of variable frequencies, guaranteeing dynamic spirit replies of varied length. The ambience banks, while musically beautiful, serve no true purpose. Definitely wouldn't run them while recording a session. Holloway puts out a usable app in Divinus as well as finding a suitable replacement to the ""areasbox"" that went with Mr. Miller.",5,8,1.2,2018-10-01 04:35:47,,
