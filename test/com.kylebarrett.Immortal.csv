Kyle, big PP! I very rarely find myself as captivated by mobile game, as I found myself playing Immortal Rogue. Full 12 hours day went down the drain since the moment I installed it! It feels a bit repetitive at times but does it really matter if I still wasn't able to put my phone down? Nah! Saw some people complaining about not-so-good controls (which are gesture-based) but I bet it's because they didn't spend enough time to get used to it. I had no such problem!
