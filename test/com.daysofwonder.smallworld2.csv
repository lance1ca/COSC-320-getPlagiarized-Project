However there are a couple frustrating bugs. Online leaderboard crashes anytime i try to open it. Also, due to the way pieces automatically jump back into your hand each turn, white priestesses are utterly useless since only the spaces you conquered would go towards your ivory tower (any extras stay in your hand, wasted). There should also be some kind of undo button for misclicks. While playing pass and play, someone accidentally clicked redeploy so they could no longer attack on their turn even though they hadnt done anything yet. Game is great but please fix these, thanks.  After reading other reviews, i just want to add-ive played many online games no problem, and getting an account wasnt hard. Ive never crashed midgame on my s7. Ive never seen the AI go in decline 2 turns in a row. Dragon master works fine. I think many of these reviews are outdated and are complaining about fixed items at this point.",4,0,2.5.1-1366-1803d5f5,2018-03-01 00:16:11,,

Love this! Thank you Asmodee! Original review: This is my favorite game translated into app form. I was excited to play this when I first saw it. However, game play is often cut short because this crashes about half of the time. Worse, is that when I roll the die, I know it's going to come up blank. I've played this close to twenty times with many rolls per game, and only rolled something other than a blank twice. This is not random, and is unacceptable. The number of blanks rolled should be closer to 50%. 1 star until this gets resolved.",4,3,2.5.1-1366-1803d5f5,2017-11-29 09:37:22,,

Clunky, buggy, crashes.  My husband and I own the board game and love it. We both purchased this app to play together.  It was a challenge just to add each other as friends in the game so we could play together.  We had to go to an outside website to locate our player tags so we could search and add each other in game.  When we finally got around to playing the actual game it was novel but overall disappointing.  I was frustrated because you can't do anything else on your phone while in game and waiting for your opponent to make a move.  You get to stare at then staring at their phone.  I would have liked to be able to keep a game going over the course of a day or two with each person playing their turn when they are able to.  Kind of like Words with Friends.  You really have to commit to seeing the whole game through to the end with no breaks. Ultimately we kept trying to play and enjoy the game but the app kept freezing and crashing repeatedly.  Can't believe I paid money for this... My only hope is that the $$ goes a little way towards improving what could be an epic game app.",1,0,2.5.1-1366-1803d5f5,2017-11-10 22:09:33,"Hello,

LONGER REVIEW: The gameplay itself is AWESOME, but the apps are awful! Constant crashes, games exiting unexpectedly, if you are waiting for a game in the lobby and change to another app then you may be kicked out of the lobby. Turn off the screen with the game running and the game will crash. This is similar to the problems with the desktop game - the bugs have not been fixed for 2 years or so...  If you have purchased the expansion DLC through another platform, you cannot transfer it across to the Android app and need to repurchase. This is due to the play store rules, but in order to get around that surely they could provide the DLC expansions for a token payment of around 10 cents for those who have already purchased them on another platform?   I bought the game for ~$2.50 and now you want me to pay a further $10 for the DLC on mobile? Even though I already paid for them on steam?

Have played the boardgame many times.  I been playing mostly solo on a Nexus 7, 1gen.   No crashes or AI cheating that I've seen.  Bug: Text does not reverse in Face to Face mode.  I agree that there should be an ""undo"" feature.  Dragging troops works fine, but a tap/confirmation option in settings would also be good.  There does appear to be an asynchronous option for ongoing games with buddies with 15 min, 4 and 48hr turn options.  I also agree that a player should be able to forfeit without ending a multiplayer game (perhaps triggering a decline with no further moves).  I haven't tested to see if this has been implemented.  I can consistently beat the AI, would like a difficulty level.  Catapult rules need to be clarified to explicitly permit or prohibit multiple uses per turn (my understanding is that the game prohibits, but the rules are vague).

The game crashes occasionally, maybe once in every ten times played. However, any game progress you have made is saved up to that point.  Computer AI plays a strong game and the rules seem to follow the board game correctly. The AIs do not seem to collude against you which is nice. First few games, the AI beat me soundly, but now unless i tap somewhere by mistake, i usually come out ahead. The game plays far quicker than the actual board game :)  One small issue that bothers me: it is easy to miss things. For example, when you forget to redeploy troops (ie new baby skeleton) or to use your 'peace' trait/skill, or you drag onto/attack your previous race by mistake, i wish the game would come up with a 'Did You Forget?' screen.   Will consider buying the expansions, but at $3/3/5, a little pricey. The option to disable certain races/skills would be nice as i am not a fan of all the expansion content. (Cursed special power i hate) . Note: Have only played solo play against the AI.

Now that it is out I can say this is the best board game on Android. Period.   For those whom never played the game. Small World is a very light war strategy game where each player picks one race. But, with each new game a special power is paired with each race. The combination determines what the size of the army it will be at the beginning and what two powers it will be allowed to use during the game. This makes each game almost different everytime you play. When your race becomes useless you can decline that race and pick a new one.  The app it self is well designed, loads up quickly on my Samsung Tab 2, easy to use, and pretty to look at. You can solo against a tough AI (at least to me), go online against random player or against your buddies (works with Steam and iOS players). Or, use your Droid to play a hot seat game offline.The 3 other expansions that you can purchase adds even more fun to the game.   I highly recommend this game!! Go!!
