Hopefully the other games get ported too!,5,17,2.1,2021-01-25 18:31:10,,

This is a very interesting step forward for them! Lets address the elephant in the room, this game doesnt perform well, my device is rocking a helio p60 with 6gbs of ram, and while this game is a looker, i imagine its optimization issues. In the future id love to see some tweeks to get it running better, maybe a resolution scale option? I personally would like controller support, but thats me specifically. A charming puzzle game.",5,21,2,2021-01-21 00:58:00,,

Looks like lots of fun. The only problem is that it's horribly optimized. Seriously, unless your phone is a flagship from the last couple years, don't even think about playing it now. Wait a while. It would be better as a PC or console experience.",2,25,2,2021-01-20 11:12:05,"Hello!
You can change graphics quality in settings (you can try with lowest settings).

Expect an update soon for performance anyway!",2021-01-21 07:39:16
