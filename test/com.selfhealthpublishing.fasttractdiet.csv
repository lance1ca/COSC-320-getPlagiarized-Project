The Symptoms do have a time stamp. The meals only list if it was breakfast, lunch dinner or snack. Adding a time stamp to meals is a possibility I will consider. We are working on an update that will allow input of ""custom"" symptoms and we are separating the anxiety, fatigue, headaches. Update due out by February 2018.",2017-12-27 09:04:14

Lots of raw veg on here but what about cooked.. like broccoli for instance? Who eats that raw? What is the fp for cooked? And also meats. What about Lamb? Thats not on here either,2,0,1.7,2017-06-27 00:50:31,"Next version add a note: If you measure all veggies raw and then cook them, the FP will never increase and may decrease slightly. Some examples of cooked veggies were added to show that some veggies, especially green leafy veggies, loose water upon cooking and become more condensed leading to a higher FP per measured volume. All meats = 0 PF points",2017-11-23 04:15:37
