After buying the physical ga!e, I was sad to see that the physical solo option was out of print. So glad this was made.",5,0,1.07,2020-09-28 15:58:12,,

I can't save, so when I have a break in my game and continue later, I have to start a new solo deck - hence my 3 star rating (as is, this is not a good substitute for the physical solo deck). Hopefully a save feature will be added soon. 2. There's 21 cards, not 23. I'm assuming the missing two cards are used for the expansion locations (?). If so, there's no option for including or excluding them.",3,6,1.07,2020-07-07 06:37:21,,
