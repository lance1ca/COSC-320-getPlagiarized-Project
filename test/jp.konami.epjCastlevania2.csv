The game doesn't make it clear that you have to play as Alucard for the plot as it tells the player to enter Richter or Maria when creating a new file. New players might actually miss the plot. So it would be best if the game also showed Alucard when creating a new file. Overall solid game. Fluid controls and spells are one tap which is helpful.,5,17,1.0.1,2020-11-27 22:21:41,,

UPDATE:So it seems the original saving system is still in place if you load the game save, making a copy of the save fixed the clock room for me. On screen controls in general are ihenrently not great, don't blame them. The voices are not the original and that's kind of a bum, let us choose voice and text language separately.

It controls well* and there is no perceivable lag. Annoying that they kept the borders (a bland castle wall this time) but hey, this is Konami and lazy ports of great games are the best we can expect from them now. Would have been improved with a more intuitive touch menu system with a favourites wheel or touch bar for each hand (perhaps in that wasted space at the sides of the screen?) but if the worst experience you'll have playing this game is switching weapons then there isn't much to complain about. At the time of writing I'm a good bit into the inverted castle and I haven't noticed any bugs so the game seems to be intact, it does seem easier than I remember and sometimes feels like it has adaptive difficulty (definitely took longer to beat Olrox the first time I played this game!) but maybe it's just me. You can cruise through most of it with the Holy Rod and a decent sword. All in all well worth the asking price as this is a legendary game which still plays just as well all these years later, newcomers make sure you check how to avoid the bad ending as you'll miss half of the game. Would love Rondo and the GBA & DS trilogies next please! * I'm playing this on a GPD XD handheld with built in physical controls, obviously knock at least 3 stars off if you're playing with touch controls or a laggy BT controller. In fact if you are going to use touch controls then don't bother at all.",5,29,1.0.0,2020-04-24 13:47:52,,

The port meets performance expectations (smooth framerate and responsive control; sounds good, too). While not used to on-screen soft controls; they seem pretty good (was able to cast Hellfire and Summon Spirit manually). I was a little disappointed this isn't supported on the NVidia Shield portable (tegra 3); but it runs well on my GPD XD and Samsung GN8. I would like to see this patched to support controller customization (GPD XD, 8bitdo, etc.) as I currently cannot use mist form on the GPD XD. I remember the PSP getting around the lack of L/R2 by using the analog stick directions and the PS Vita using the rear touch panel. The ability to use hybrid buttons/soft controls is also appealing (spell bar at the bottom, for example). I'm also happy to see they left a lot of the mechanics and some bugs in the game - it feels like a true port (skipped Death and kept my Alucard equipment, muahahahaha!).",4,0,1.0.0,2020-03-10 12:55:18,,

I tried it with the switch pro controller, but the connection is just awful. It has no USB controller support, which it really ought to have. If this had full controller support, I'd give it 5 stars. with mobile controls, it plays okay. jumping and attacking are a hassle, but they do give you a spell hotkey, which balances things out a little. pause is awkwardly in the middle of the screen at the top, which is bad since you have to access your equipment menu fairly often in this game. they should have a quick equipment button on the side or something. additionally, having to confirm equipment choices is a hassle. just auto equip what the player selects. less clicks/taps is more. too many taps to just equip the new sword I found. the aspect ratio is maintained from the original, so you have extra border space on the sides which is primarily occupied with the controls overlay, so much of the actual gamescreen isn't too covered. It's a shame you can't control the size of the input intefrace nor opacity. it would be great if you could.

I'm using a Google Pixel 3a XL, and the game runs very well on it. Unfortunately, using an 8BitDo SN30 resulted in a significant amount of input lag. Switching to an 8BitDo Lite (which doesn't officially support Android, oddly) worked much better, though I have to pair the controller with my phone each time from scratch. As with the DXC version of SotN, this version has wildly inaccurate sound emulation at times, and it has the new voice acting and scenes from that version. Somehow, they've managed to make the pre-rendered video cutscenes of the castle look even worse in this version. Thankfully, this version does have some changes in the form of redesigned menus. While you may initially scoff at the idea of such a masterpiece having mobile-friendly menus, but it works surprisingly well, and it's nice to see a version of SotN with something resembling finished menus.

Alucard isn't Alucard if he's not voiced by Robert Belgrade, and SotN isn't SotN without classical one-liners like ""No, this cannot be!"" and ""What is a man? A miserable pile of secrets!"" Konami should stop feeling embarrassed over the original dialogue and voice acting of SotN; it's a modern classic at this point, and we real SotN fans hate this botched up attempt at fixing something that never was broken to begin with. Plus I'd like to see an HD remake of SotN with beautiful 4K graphics, 5.1 lossless surround sound of the original soundtrack (with I am the Wind included at the end of the game) released on the PlayStation 4. If Capcom could give us well made Mega Man 1 and Mega Man X remakes on the PSP, I don't see why SotN should be excluded from the stellar treatment it deserves. I mean seriously now, how many times has Konami released a SotN port to a new platform whenever Konami needed some extra cash in these financially desperate times? Why not just release a beautiful 4K remake of SotN on the PS4? It would be a yuuuuge bestseller. Anyway aside from that, it'd be nice if Konami could bring back Koji Igarashi, Ayami Kojima and Michiru Yamane and let them do some old school Castlevania again.
