Excellent upgrade paths and mech abilities. A few small things: I maxed out Power Generation Speed but have no idea how that practically helped me. From no ranks to max, getting repair drones seemed to take forever either way. Towers get blocked by UI. Inability to zoom out sucks when towers are blocked by UI, have to ZOOM IN and lose SA to upgrade sometimes. Maps should indicate if they have 3x3 spaces so you dont waste 2 slots on towers you cant even place.
