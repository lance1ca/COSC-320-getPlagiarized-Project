I love it. It would be brilliant if the program allowed the 'off page conn' symbol to jump or hyperlink to another desired location of the flowchart on the page in use, or another page. I look forward to future developments with this program. Keep up the good work.",5,0,1.2.5,2017-03-15 15:36:28,,

The desktop app has a lot more features and diagram types currently not supported in the mobile version, hence diagram files created in the mobile and desktop versions are not interchangeable.

What I would suggest is (1) Allow nodes to link to pages. So I tap a node and can link to another page. Then that node can have a color border indicating it has a page link. Then I tap that node and can jump to the page from there. And (2) a button that jumps to the paid version in the app store. I had to search and then go to the free app, then go to more apps from you just to find the paid version. :)",5,1,1.1.8,2016-09-12 08:04:05,Thank you very much for the feedback and suggestions.,2016-09-13 00:37:46
