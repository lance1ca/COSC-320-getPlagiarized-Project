The name of this game is: make the numbers go higher, but without any meaningful progression. Once you learn how to make the various skill shots, the only thing left is How long can I make the numbers go down in one shot.  I don't regret buying it, I regret the price. Hopefully Holedown 2 is a bit more Peggle 1. Then there would be something to recommend the game. At his point, I would not suggest buying it for anything more that $2.",3,2,,2019-02-27 09:27:37,,
