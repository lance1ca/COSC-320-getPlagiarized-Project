Marinov could add to make this app truly stellar.       A few ideas of mine: - Live constellation view outside of FM mode.  I would really like to look at BPSK and QPSK constellations that could be generated in ISM bands - Demodulation of other signals such as PSK and FSK.   - Settable integration bandwidth for power readings - Adjustable resolution bandwidth - Markers with deltas so that I could compare power levels of two or more signals (or portions of a signal) in band. - Adjustable power scale and resolution in spectrum and waterfall - Absolute calibrated power in dBm on the spectrum.  That might be pretty hard because of the array of devices that this app can use. - Different color maps and adjustable time resolution for the waterfall",4,22,1.03,2016-01-03 14:38:18,,

Works nicely in my GT P-6800 and is very stabile.  Looking forward for improvements to all the existing and beta demodulators. Others on the wishlist are: frequency correction option (my rtl is about 12kHz off at around 145MHz mark), waterfall, gain control options & squelch features. Once all above are in place, 5 starts would be too low.   Keep doing the good work. zl1klp",4,0,1.01,2013-01-29 18:10:41,,

Well worth the price.  Works great with the E4000 and the R820T.  Absolutely amazing!  Would like some extra controls -- ex: tune step (instead of the direct frequency entry, which is nice as well).  Awesome work!",5,1,1.01,2013-01-21 15:39:25,,
