I'm giving this app 3 stars mainly because: you cannot click on a member to see all of their posts [you only have a ""feed""], and you do not get a notification when someone replies to your comment. In fact, you cannot even reply directly ... so all you can do is leave a comment and then later, scroll down through your feed to hopefully find that post you commented on [if you remember], and check if a response was given. :(",3,3,1.0.6,2021-02-01 07:01:45,,
