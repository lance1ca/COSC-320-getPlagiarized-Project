Yes, you read that right, LTE band zero. Second issue relates to the dark mode on my Samsung unit, when this is enabled (which happens by default) the option to have the signalcheck pro status bar icon change color according to carrier branding/band type (AKA mode) no longer works, tried to set this and it does not take. hopefully an update will be put out to resolve this, as these issues are kinda annoying.

It worked just fine with Oxygen OS in the past, so I do not think it is an issue with that. It worked with Android 8 on the 6p, so that is not the issue.
