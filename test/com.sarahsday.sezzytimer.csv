I had the OG app a while back and this is a vast improvement. I especially love that theres a custom option to build your own circuit workout. My only recommendation is that I wished it showed the total time of the workout. For example the sweaty shredders are about half an hour so itd be nice to see how far you're in time wise. Or if you are creating your own workout you can see how long it would be just in case youre trying to schedule out your gym sesh into your day.,4,27,1.0,2019-03-02 21:13:53,,
