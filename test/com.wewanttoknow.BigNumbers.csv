Growing and picking apples to spend on other things, your kids will be adding and subtracting the whole time. Even this mom (like a crazy person up way too late) is working her own area to see what happens as the game progresses. One tip - my daughter didn't realize she could write in the answers when it would let her and thought she had to tap the answer box and listen to it three times. Maybe something when that first happens to show you can?",5,5,1.0,2016-11-18 06:02:51,"Thanks Marni! Glad you can spend some quality time with your kids :) About the improvement request, I passed it on to the team and we will see what we can do! Thanks again!",2016-12-12 04:45:20

While the mechanics are very different, once again it has superbly fun gameplay, but with long addition and subtraction so fully integrated that the child needn't even realise they are learning maths. Working with big numbers becomes something natural and exciting, and done for a purpose rather than just as an abstract concept. They can then take this enthusiasm into the classroom.",5,7,1.0,2016-11-12 07:45:46,Thanks a lot Jonathan :),2016-11-14 00:19:25
