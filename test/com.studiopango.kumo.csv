You can't drag the cloud which is the natural way of playing such games. My kid tried over and over again to drag it but it's not designed that way. Instead you need to press somewhere on the screen and the cloud moves to that direction. Also there should be on option to disable lightnings. It was too scary for my child to see a building on fire with someone inside. Get these little things fixed and this'll be a great educational game.,2,19,1.0,2018-12-17 00:11:14,"Thanks for the feedback, it helps us a lot. We will try to improve the cloud movement in a future update.",2019-01-07 01:49:09
