Simply put this is the best Sydney public transport app full stop. Ignore the ignorant people giving this poor reviews of course you need to be online for live updates!! That's not a reason for a poor review maybe a sign to seek professional support? The train live updates are great only a few minutes tops in delays. The buses can be about more but this isn't tripviews fault blame the bus companies lying about service statuses. This app will save you time without a doubt. Buy it and enjoy one less thing to worry about.,5,7,3.8,2018-12-08 14:35:55,,

Reply to reply (2/2/18): Yes, I expect that Sydney Trains won't supply realtime data regarding the set type (I think they list lots of trains as K sets when they know ahead of time that they will be S sets - same ""K"" train for last 5 days has actually been S). My suggestion is for users to report this information using the app. Melbourne's Train Trapper allows users to report a delay, I would envisage a similar functionality here, but for set type, possibly using the car number and a database as verification.

I personally would prefer setting my alarms in one go, in the morning to save time. 2. ‚ÄúAlarm time‚Äù not useful when it tells me 30mins, it should tell me when the alarm is going to go off like 9:18 3. Before tripview I had to go onto cityrail and search the timetable as well as the cost of my ticket.

This would also allow for multiple bus numbers which share the same route but not stand number to appear as one trip rather than multiple.
