It is very challenging and is great when I need to loosen up my brain. The 3D isometric visuals are very nice too. My only complaint is that it does not work on Amazon Fire tablets, even though they handle other Android games, even this developers own Traffix game. When I try to download it from the Play store is will not let me and says my device is not compatible. I would love to see this on my Fire 10 HD's big screen. For now I must settle for the tiny screen on my phone. I hope you can fix this.",4,38,1.71,2020-10-23 09:17:51,"Hi A J. Thank you for your feedback.
