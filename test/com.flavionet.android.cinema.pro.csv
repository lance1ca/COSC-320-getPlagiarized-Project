Although it is already super versatile it is somewhat limiting. I would love to see more special features in the coming updates.  1) HIGHER FRAME RATE: To my knowledge, through playing with the settings and reading the user manual, the app is limited to 30fps. I have lowered my resolution setting hoping to open up higher frame rates but no dice. For an app with a name that alludes to being cinematic this is a big limitation. 2) TIME LAPS: This is a common cinematic feature that many film makers and travelers want to have in their bag of tools.

One minor thing I don't like, however, is that the controls along the bottom of the app are perilously close to the touch-sensitive controls on the GPad, the ones that return to the Home Screen, and the on-screen Back Button. One thing I can offer other users that were initially having white balance troubles when first starting out with this app: Hold a white piece of paper, or face the back of some person wearing a white t-shirt, get the white in the entire frame and then select average white balance on the white balance controls. You'll get a great looking color rendition in your video.

Worked fine until 2 versions ago but now crashes when setting up an external folder. I have root an write enabeled on external card on android 4.4 galaxy s5. Also after setting up white balance and iso and filming something I can no longer change them as they get locked on the first settings. I can only change them after a restart,1,1,1.12,2014-04-27 22:52:07,,

I have waited for a good movie style video camera for a very long time. I can't wait to see a movie completely made from a smartphone with a good camera.
