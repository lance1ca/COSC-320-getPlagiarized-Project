I'd like to know which one, because it seems to have more materials for game-making than FES does. It's truly an impressive game, and I'm not just saying that because it's Yuri. One thing I noticed, though, is that at equipment shops the items ""Equipped"" and in ""Possession"" aren't accurately reflected; they always show 0.
