Small historical Wiki that would additionally make the experience of the history lovers even greater  3.

Make some research time dependable not only money dependable (money can speed up the research)  6. Experience points from campaigns do not add up to the total experience  7. Make some of the units country specific  8. Touch sometimes is not working correctly (zooming when I want to move)  9.

Additionally, the text is sometimes confusing (it was obviously not written by a native english speaker), giving a slightly less-than-professional feel to an otherwise beautiful interface. After playing for about an hour, i still have little idea how the combat system actually works (sure, i can partake in combat, but don't have any feel whatsoever for what the outcome of a battle will be, so i'm not a terribly effective commander!). i'm quite certain that this game is much more fun once one figures out how exactly the mechanics work, but i'm not willing to invest so much time in figuring all that out for myself - the tutorial should have _walked_ me through that info rather than just providing me with a few non-interactive/read-along screens which don't explain the basic things like how to deploy troops.",3,8,1.06,2012-12-08 05:00:59,,

But perhaps with some house rules advanced variants and a LOT of different boards/campaigns to play on. If you like those kinds of games, it's definitely up your alley. Addictive turn-based strategy game for sure with quite a bit of polish. Glad I took the leap and bought it.",5,3,1.06,2012-11-27 12:32:40,,
