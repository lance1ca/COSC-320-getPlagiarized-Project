However, I am giving 3 stars because I have to sometimes hit the same preset button a total of about three times just to make sure it goes where it's supposed to. This is not good especially if I am using this app as a remote and don't have a screen in front of me to verify that it is working properly. Please fix! I don't mind paying for the app, but all the more reason why this needs to be fixed.",3,11,1.2.0,2020-07-05 06:12:34,,

Clean and simple. I have purchased both the IOS and Android versions. 2 requests to make it even better.. Please move the delete button further away from the close button when adding a camera... It's easier to hit than you think... Also... I would love a backup option somthing to save camera settings and presets whether local or cloud.,5,20,1.2.0,2019-04-07 11:24:36,,

Being able to set the speed and being able to use more than one camera setting for the same camera makes it even more useful.
