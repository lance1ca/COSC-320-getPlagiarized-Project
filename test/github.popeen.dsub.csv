Server was kind of a pain to install, got tomcat failures until I gave up and used the docker version. Not the end of the world. However, the M4B file support is not there at all. First, the server was trying to transcode it to mp3 and failing miserably, making invalid files that wouldn't open. OK, so I disabled the transcoding, redownloaded the file, still doesn't play with the android app. However, there is nothing wrong with the file as I can take the downloaded book and play it with any other audiobook app. So this is purely a player problem in the android app. So now what, do I spend a ton of time converting from a lossless format to mp3 so this app works? Do I use this app soley as a download management app and play books with another app? Edit: I did go through the work and converted everything to chapterized MP3 and its been flawless with that so far. App has issues with M4B files and some large single MP3 files. If you split them, fix the metadata, seems like it works just fine.",4,6,2008,2020-08-24 07:47:55,"Yea the m4b support is very hit and miss, it seem like more miss then hit lately unfortunately

As for Air, no not at the moment. That said, adding features to Air will be much more possible then the old server so I'm hoping to better support it in the future. I'm also looking at natively support it in the app so that transcoding won't be necessary",2020-08-20 15:22:41

Once you configure it, it is perfect. Configuring is not that hard. I chose the docker container for the server. Once a few books are on the server and you can play them from any home computer via your web-browser, you can try android client configuration. The little confusing stuff for me was that it could not connect initially, but then I realised - you have to choose your home access point name (SSID). That makes sense - so that booksonic client does not try to connect to server in any other networks. Greatest thing for audiobooks. And I am not even mentioning podcasts yet - subscribe to any rss easily and keep episodes on your home server.",5,1,1.0.13,2017-10-22 03:18:31,"Glad you like it!
Actually you should be able to connect to it even from outside your network as long as you use your public IP in the server address field and forward your ports in the router. When the SSID is set and matching the network you are currently on the app will instead connect to the IP in the field Local Network Address.",2018-02-17 23:45:49

As your previous version of the comment stated that you have tried using your public IP you seem to be on the right track.

You would need some kind of tunneling to get it online if you don't have your own IP. I have very limited space to answer here but post it on the subreddit as well and I'll explain it a bit more

One thing I really wish it had would be an ability to have variable speed with pitch correction on playback.  I use Smart Audiobook Player a lot and I listen at 1.3x normally.  I am not sure I can get used to listening to the audiobooks at a normal speed after doing it for so long at 1.3x.    Otherwise I appreciate your efforts so far!  The server works great too.  I will need to tweak my metadata and album covers though.  A lot seem to either not exist in my folders.  Some of my mp3s have the cover in the metadata as well.

The server should look at the tags (but priority is folder structure). The covers however need to be added as images in the book folder, for example as cover.jpg",2016-10-15 14:50:00
