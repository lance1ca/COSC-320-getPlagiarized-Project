Facebook didn't work at all, and Google does work, but I have to sign in every so often in a single session. Instagram was hit or miss, and I would be signed in, then it wouldn't have any images loaded, and then it would be signed in and I could get my report started. I love the concept, and the UI is great looking, but there's a lot of issues related to accounts and logins.",3,0,1.0.3,2021-01-29 08:37:15,,

There is something quite soothing about it. Not all features seem to be working at the moment and you have to pay extra for some parts. Having said all of this for under 1,50â‚¬ it is great value for money. I assume I will have to pay again for next year? Looking forward to seeing how it develops.",5,1,1.0.3,2021-01-03 00:34:10,,
