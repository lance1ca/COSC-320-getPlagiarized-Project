your typical RPG to it's roots, offering very little depth but what is 
there, simplicity, works surprisingly well. By doing the bare minimum, it's 
hard to say whether it'll keep RPG veterans engaged at all but is a great 
addition to the library of newcomers to the genre or much younger gamers in 
general. Combat is simple & the controls are fine. Visuals are lovingly 
crafted and the cat-puns are a love it or hate it type deal. Despite giving 
this four stars, it still remains a forgettable game & the lack of depth is 
my largest gripe. I enjoyed the ride, but I won't be hopping on again any

While Cat Quest is a fun game, it has a few things that if done differently I would have probably given it 5 stars. One of my main complaints is that the game is just 90 percent random side quests that have really no meaning towards the story. You just pick them up at quest boards and do the same basic tasks over and over. However, the dialogue on the side quests is fun and well written. You spend most of your time leveling up to do the next main quest that lasts 2 minutes. Once you get the key to the golden chests all of the gear you get from quests become useless so you just run around opening golden chests to become stronger so then you feel like you are grinding side quests for experience and that becomes old quick.  My biggest complaint is about the legendaries. Once you receive any one of these items,(which you can do very early on, any challenge the game offered is basically over and the game becomes stale almost instantly. I pretty much lost interest after finding faith and feeling like there was no point anymore. All in all this is a fun game with smooth controls for click and walk and definitely worth the 5 dollars. Just felt the need to put in my 2 cents for what it's worth.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Changed my rating to 3 stars because just when I thought the main story was going to open up and become decent it ends abruptly! The main story is like 20 minutes long seriously. Terrible cliffhanger ending.",3,6,1.1.2,2017-12-11 18:12:08,,

I normally don't go for the cartoon style role playing games but options for games without in-app purchasing are limited. So it tried it. Very pleasantly surprised. Enjoyable to play with enough central narrative and side quests to hold interest. Not a deep immersive experiance but really fun and with enough challenge for the casual phone game player. Would think this would be great for kids because of the lack of having to constantly buy progress with in-app payments.,5,5,1.1.2,2017-12-09 02:16:33,,

The quests are short and simple and allow you to play  when you only have brief periods of free time. The storyline is fun with good humor.

Mechanics have been stripped down to the basics- a weapon, two armor slots, a handful of spells, and four stats that rise by set amounts every level. Not complex, but that- plus short quests and dungeons- facilitates easy drop-in, drop-out game sessions. The plot never rises above the usual tropes, but what it lacks in originality, it makes up in execution. In fact, it's better structured then most ""serious""  RPGs. The characters are likeable, pacing is good, and nothing is wasted- every sidequest chain eventually folds back into the main plot, revealing more of the game lore. The one serious issue is the interface. You tap on an enemy to attack with your sword, yourself to cast a spell, and anywhere else to move there. But combat can get intense, and in the heat of it it's easy to tap the wrong thing. I never got used to it, and died more times due to mis-taps then I'd care to admit. But the game is well-designed enough to be worth pushing through those troubles.",4,2,1.0.155,2017-10-14 19:58:08,,

The world is explorable, the controla for android are actually great. The questing is fun and the game has a quest travker which directs you where to go.

However, I am only a few hours in and I can honestly say that I haven't been able to find a great RPG for Android since the port of Star Wars KOTOR.  Great job, I have no complaints for the game. :)  I was wondering if you could possibly add controller support? It would work wonders on this game. But don't get me wrong, it's brilliant as can be.

I play this on my Stylo 3 and it works perfectly with my stylus. I would love to see a more detailed inventory/character screen, perhaps a paper doll for equipped items, as well as a quest info tab, as sometimes I forget the details of my current quest. The inventory screen looks very bland compared to the vibrant graphics in the game. Equipped items show up on the hero, which is very cool. No IAP, no viewing ads for extra ""goodies"", no interruptions, make for an enjoyable playing experience. Just wondering if there is a way to sell inventory at some point. I'm getting quite a collection of items I'll never use and sure could use some extra cash...then again, who couldn't! üòÄ I don't play Fremium games or games with ads, so this is a true gem for me.
