I was very excited! However, its absolutely impossible to play effectively since the direction arrows located at the left bottom of the screen as well as the jump botton the right side are so small and make it impossible to work with them. Timing your jumps and moves is completely impossible. They should really make them easier to use.",2,13,1.12,2020-06-14 12:36:56,"There are many on-screen choices to currently choose from. Use the ""MENU"" from in-game.

The GUI will be much improved in the next version.",2020-06-15 13:22:48
