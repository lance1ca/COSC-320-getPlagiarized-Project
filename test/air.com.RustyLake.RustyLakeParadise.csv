However, this entry in the series was definitely my least favorite. As always, art style and graphics were amazing. However, the controls for this game were less intuitive and actually quite tedious and tiring. I finished this game in one session like I have with every other Rusty Lake game and my arm was physically sore from having to continually swipe left and right, through multiple screens, just to navigate the island. In addition, the puzzles in this game were much easier than in past games and the content seemed to be sparse perhaps due to the map size. Overall, I would obviously recommend that Rusty Lake fans play this game, but you should just be aware that it won't be the most fun you have with the series.",3,21,1.0.14,2018-09-06 04:59:43,,

The gameplay has always proven engaging, clever, and addictive with a pleasingly macabre and mysterious vibe; and I never minded any of the mild gore or oddness of the series. Needless to say, I had high expectations for this one, and was really let down. The storyline is just kinda blah, the tasks are borderline nonsensical (and yes, I know odd solutions are a staple of the series but these were really out there) and it's just.... lackluster. I'm sorry to say, it's just not worth the money.",3,3,1.0.13,2018-01-23 17:57:27,,

Just completed it though haven't gotten all the achievements yet. Didn't live up to Roots or Hotel, and I think lags behind quite a few of the free RL games. The puzzles were okay with a few really enjoyable ones, some rehashing from older games is expected and enjoyable, but it felt like not quite enough new things. The story didn't quite grab me in the same way some of the others did. I didn't feel like I really got to know any of the characters distinctly, like in Roots. There was a passage of time, but there didn't seem to be noticeable development. Also, why no female voice actor? I think it would have helped here. Mr. Rafferty is quite talented, but for the sister and mother it was odd enough to take me out of the world. I don't know, Bob's voice worked for the mother's few lines in Birthday but it was a bit too odd here. Perhaps it's time to get the women of RL a more distinct voice.

I had to look up two clues from walkthroughs on puzzles that stumped me. I appreciate that Rusty Lake produces walkthroughs for their players.  The game play is exciting and creepy.
