Catamaran. The starboard engine control is underneath the 
wheel which makes controlling both engines at the same time without 
inadvertently moving the wheel impossible.",1,6,1.089,2018-07-31 02:35:56,,

This isn't a game as such. I hope the updates keep coming. I would advise the developer to maybe change the category from sports to simulator. I look for apps like this on a regular basis and only just found this by translating German.,5,7,1.074,2017-03-19 14:33:42,,

I own a 50ft sailboat and I am always faced with new docking and tight maneuver situations with prop walk and wind. I enjoy this app as I can practice handling challenging situations without fear of damaging my boat and others' boats. The app is no replacement for training, but it's useful to stay tuned, particularly over the winter months when my boat is on the dry.  The newest version introduced an option for wind speeds up to 20 knots. This is both realistic and necessary to practice- it's a lot safer and cheaper to practice on an app than make mistakes in real wind storms!! The prior version introduced a nice wind indicator and the ability to practice in current. These are great upgrades to an already terrific practice app. Thank you!!",5,11,1.068,2017-01-20 20:46:35,,
