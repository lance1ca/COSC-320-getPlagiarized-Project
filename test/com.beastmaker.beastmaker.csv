This app didn't provide that as it suggests two fingers hangs for the 5A easiest routine. Used HIIT interval app instead and training plan from M L Anderson's book now. My best bet before getting injured in two pocket hangs suggested for 5A routine. Sorry I love the best maker and the app is not too bad but the training plan is just unrealistic and unhelpful.,1,0,,2016-08-10 15:06:30,,

The timer stops when you switch to another application, I'd imagine many people want to use data and phones/tablets during the rest period between hangs. There is no logging of custom workouts, it would be good if at a bare minimum the total hang time is recorded and then possible to plot within the app or export as CSV for use in other programs.
