Thank you so much for keeping this project open source. My purchase is the least I could do to thank you for a decision that so few make nowadays, yet it's a decision that is monumentally important. You deserve what I paid a thousand times over. Thank you for this app and thank you for keeping it open source.",5,2,2.8.0,2020-12-31 13:12:01,Thank you for feedback! If you have any ideas how to improve the app please write me on mikhail.kulesh@gmail.com. Happy new year!,2020-12-31 13:26:55
