I highly recommend it if you like board games and carefully planning out your moves. It's essentially a board game puzzle with turn based combat. I call it a puzzle because most maps have very little flexibility in how to tackle the map. Quests all must be completed by a certain turn on the board, and there's rarely a lot of extra time to meet it. Most of the time you'll finish a quest at the last moment you can. Because of this, one mistake or bad dice roll can effectively end the map. Also, often they throw curveballs at you, like discovering you have to defeat a flying monster by turn 15, only to realize it's turn 14 and none of your heroes have a bow which is necessary to even fight a flying monster. This means you have to be overly prepared for everything, or just accept you'll spend 30 minutes on a map to lose at the last second to some surprise to have to do it all again. That's why it's essentially a puzzle. I'd give it 5 stars if there were a little more wiggle room in maps. But overall, it's well worth the money.",4,25,1.1.0,2019-08-02 07:30:39,,

The legends are challenging, particularly in 'challenge' mode, but are easy to dip in and out of with the autosave feature. I'm really enjoying the game so far and look forward to playing more of the legends! One possible improvement could be offering some form of rulebook so those who want to know the ins and outsbof the game. For example I havent yet worked out if gold and items gained during a legend are carried forward.",5,26,1.0.4,2019-01-27 11:27:06,,

However, I've been an avid fan of the Andor board game series for many years and I can honestly say that the developers nailed the digital adaptation. It's true to the original in terms of its mechanics, it runs very smoothly on my Galaxy A3, and it provides lots of content at a really low (and up-front!) price. More often than not, mobile adaptations of established brands are lazy cash-grabs, but these guys have really gone the extra mile to make Andor fans happy.",5,24,1.0.3,2019-01-23 02:42:26,Thank you so much Mjeno!,2019-01-23 03:10:10
