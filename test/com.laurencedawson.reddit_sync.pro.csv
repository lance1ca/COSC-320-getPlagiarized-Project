In fact I actually 
prefer it to the reddit desktop site. There is a lot of customisation 
starting with how the app looks. You can choose from a bunch of different 
visual styles and layouts and even customise the colours to your liking. My 
favourite mode is full height cards since I am subbed to a lot of image 
heavy subs but there are also list views if you mainly view text subs or 
prefer to save data etc. There are a few variants for card mode such as 
small cards for those that prefer cards to simply act as thumbnail 
previews. There are a lot of options not related to appearance. Coming from 
the official app I was surprised but pleased at all the customisation. It 
will probably take you some time to wade through all the options but if 
there is something you want to change you probably can which is great. 
Lastly the app is still under development and the dev listens to feedback 
and fixes bugs and adds new stuff which is great. All things considered 
this might very well be the best reddit app!",5,15,16.1,2018-04-24 20:18:40,,

I've checked my apps to see if my phone was compromised but that's a negative - the ads are connected to Sync only, and when I close Sync the ads go away (but not if I close anything else), plus I hadn't downloaded anything at all in months onto my phone so the chances of it being malware are nil. The ads also appear only when I use this app so I'm certain that this is the source. Is the browser automatically opening ads? They usually appear when my phone has been locked or when I first turn on Sync, not when I open external links.

I expected something slick but was rather disappointed.  First, yes the mod functions are supported, but you have to check each queue individually for activity and that can take time. The next issue is the card based interface, it is visually quite good but it wastes a lot of space, particularly the big button for the link. An option for a smaller button would be nice so it would be faster to scroll through the posts. The last thing and the real kicker is that this is the first app to kill my Nexus 5 running KK. Yep, twice while commenting, the app locked up on input and then my N5 rebooted. The phone is rooted and I have loads of other stuff installed that may have trigerred this problem. Maybe I'll try again after I upgrade the phone to Lollipop.  Given other people's positive experiences, I'm probably an outlier, but it don't work for me!!!",1,0,10.7.31,2015-09-01 11:28:45,,

The sidebar wasn't very responsive, and overall it lacked a lot of polish.  The most recent versions of the application have really come a long way, and the app has matured into one of the finest applications on Android.  That said, there are a couple usability tweaks or bugfixes that would go a long ways in this application.  One, the transparent navbar, combined with the small text, gradient, and button overlays, makes for some very hard to read text at the bottom of the screen.  I'm not sure it appreciably adds much, and it also makes apps like Twilight go a bit crazy.  Also, it really needs to remember your settings when it logs you out.  The newest version (9.0.12) logged me out.  When I logged back in, not only did all my multireddits go away (reddit1+reddit2+reddit3), but so did my subreddit order.  Fixing all that is just really unpleasant, especially when you follow as many subreddits as I do.",4,2,9.0.12,2014-05-22 05:39:13,,

Then it annoyingly covers all the text so I can't browse while looking at the image. I know there is a one tap option to open images but the whole interface is clunky. When you have a large screen you should take advantage of it. Show the whole image in one pane and find a place for comments too.
