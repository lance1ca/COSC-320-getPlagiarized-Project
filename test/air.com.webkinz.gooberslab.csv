It's so simple and easy, it's something to do when you're board and best of all, NO ANNOYING ADS! You can play without being interrupted by ads popping up every minute or so! Any kinzcash you earn will be transferred to your webkinz account (But make sure you're online, or else you won't get your kinzcash)",5,0,1.0.1.1,2019-09-14 16:51:25,,

Also, logging in on a galaxy can also be difficult because the keyboard covers the login information and you can't easily click and delete what you've put in. Overall, the app functions and the game works the same as online, I just believe it needs some aesthetic changes and an update to logging in and sending points to your account that is easier.",3,3,1.0.1.1,2019-07-19 10:23:38,,
