It provides the best selection of programs and the best features of any OTR app available. Even better, the app is definitely not stagnant. It's constantly being updated with more programs and features. I requested a feature and next thing I knew, there it was. I've tried almost every OTR app in the store, and believe me, save yourself some time and just download this one. It's the only one worth keeping. It's the only one worth paying for.
