Drilled up the ball using the recommendation from the app and it did not disappoint - actually having fun again during league instead of battling the conditions every week. Thank you for the app - paid for itself many times over.,5,0,16,2020-07-07 15:30:09,,

Hope in the future, there will be an update so you can put your PAP down and have the app help you with different layout suggestions based on the PAP!! Would give this 5+ stars if it was available :)",5,1,11,2020-04-01 15:58:13,Thanks for the kind words Jim. Since layouts are based on Axis Tilt and Axis Rotation of the bowler there is no need to have a calculation for your PAP. üòé,2020-04-01 16:26:08

I bought this to support a fellow bowler and pro shop operator with the hopes that it would be a useful tool. Having showed it to guys who work for me they all say its top notch and easy to use for everyone. It doesn't replace the pro shop operators knowledge but can help every bowler understand why their ball does what it does when then throw it and how to create a different motion via the layout. Great job Gary keep up the good work on this tool.,5,1,9,2020-02-27 12:13:39,,
