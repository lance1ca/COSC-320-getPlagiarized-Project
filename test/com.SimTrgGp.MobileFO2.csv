The sim uses the US JFIRE FM 3-09.32 doctrine. It uses the Adjust Fire (Grid Method, but polar and other mission type's will be added soon). We did develop it under advice of some Australian JTACs so may have some Australianisms.  But always happy to make modifications. Pls send us an email with more detailed feedback",2019-10-03 23:11:57

Also they don't say splash/splash out for the impact of the rounds. Otherwise extremely well made.,5,3,,2019-09-24 11:14:25,Thanks for the feedback.
