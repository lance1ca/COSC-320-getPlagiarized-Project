Basically, flawless. There is one minor kvetch. When the puzzle gets into an unwinnable state, the game immediately, obtrusively points that out. Don't do this. Either don’t have unwinnable states, or have the confidence to let the player struggle with it. Or stick it in a setting if you must. A notice of a misstep comes off as irksome and nagging.

What makes it good is a perfect difficulty curve that always keeps you engaged while never frustrating you and the soothing atmosphere which for me made for a very relaxing experience. The game is also very polished and each of the characters has its own personality highlighting the main mechanic being that the characters need eachother to make it to the end.
