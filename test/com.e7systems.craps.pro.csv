The money slider is way to sensitive. Instead it would be nice to see just a plain simple number pad so we can input our own starting amount. 2.  In the advanced settings some of the setting don't have descriptions as to what they do. For example under the dice roll randomizer it has about 6 different options to choose from but there is no description for each item. So you end up picking things and hoping you see a difference in the game. 3. The game kinda does something strange when playing. If you are betting low you almost can't pay a 7 to show up but the second I place 200 or more on a bet it shows up not just once but it literally came up 7 times in a row at one point. Please make it more true to life or at least let us know how to adjust the setting to get a better feel. And 4. Neither on my tablet or my phone the game doesn't fit on the screen I have to move it up in order to see my winnings and the bottom pass line or down to see the lay bets and place bets. Other than these few things the game is great I've learned a lot and have developed a strategy that make it almost impossible to lose that I actually tried at a real casino and won with a few times.
