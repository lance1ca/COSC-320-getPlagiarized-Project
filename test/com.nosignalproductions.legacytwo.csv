I was wanting more of a similar game so I found this one. I have to say it did not disappoint! I work in the technology field and know first hand how hard it is to storyboard, code, test, implement and maintain an app. And for one man to head up the entire life cycle of this game, it is phenomenal and was highly impressed. The storyline is great, graphics are stunning, and the puzzles are tough! I also found navigation easier than the Room and Davinci mainly because I didn't have to constantly pinch in and out to change directions after I had gotten close to an item to inspect. This navigation allows you to easily double-tap to zoom into an area and you just simply swipe left/right to rotate directions without having to zoom out. I found it much harder to solve puzzles or figure out where I needed to go next than the Room and Davinci. The rooms and Davinci keep you confined to a few rooms or areas per chapter. This one opens up more and more rooms as you progress which I found challenging to remember where exactly I had to go next. I wouldn't say this is a down side...it just made it more challenging which is the point in puzzle games. Keep up the excellent work!!

It was challenging and a good amount of playtime. I wish there had been a few more challenging puzzles but overall it was really good. The only thing I'd change is to be able to fast travel to any room instead of just some rooms and the game was a bit spread out and some items used were a bit vague to me so when u got an object sometime you had to search for awhile to remeber or figure out where that object could be used. I wish it had had more of a area by area flow because I'd forget about usable objects in rooms and be searching randomly but that could be fixed with maybe an exclamation on the map if an area has an unsolved puzzle or if an item in ur inventory could be used now.

It's very dark and also, the game is too hard in some parts (what to do with the lead ball with hole, what to do with pliers) I had to look up a walkthrough because it became boring going back and examing 20 different rooms to figure out what to do. A subtle hint system with clues to nudge you in the right direction would be good. That way, we don't have to look up a walkthrough where it just tells you what to do, that kind of ruins the fun.

Clever challenges and lots of variety.   However, many puzzles are difficult to figure out without some kind of HINT SYSTEM.

I believe this Developer has excellent skills for designing this type of game.  I own 40 Artifex Mundi games (that are somewhat similar) so I applaud this Developer  for the great quality of the game.  A little adjustment in fixing the EXCESSIVE DARKNESS and a friendly HINT feature would make it a 5 star champion.  Please improve it and make many more.

This game is a massive improvement, with better graphics and movement, and loads of interesting puzzles. I'm not sure the story made complete sense, but it rarely does in these sorts of games! It's quite challenging but the couple of times I had to use a walkthrough (in about 6 hours of play) I kicked myself afterwards for missing something obvious. The price was very fair for the content. 5 stars all the way... And I hope we get more of the same from this dev.",5,1,1.0.3,2017-12-02 08:24:39,,
