The only concern I have is about the AI of the units. The AI is a bit... Stiff to say the least, they tend to get stuck on each other a lot and mess up so the resource unit gets stuck on one another and prevents them from transporting money. The AI of the AI (Skirmish) is mostly the same as well there's like two or three different AI types that build differently such as different building styles and different unit building styles but that's about it. Front Armies could also use some more Campaign missions and Skirmish maps as well maybe some different game modes as well. Could also have a few more Land, Air, and Sea units as well as a few more building like an Anti-Nuke building. Overall good game but has a few issues.",5,7,1.2.0,2018-04-05 08:56:49,,
