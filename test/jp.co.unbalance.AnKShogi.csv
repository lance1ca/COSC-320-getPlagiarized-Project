It's all top notch. Every now and then you find something in the English translation that sounds slightly quirky, but that doesn't diminish gameplay in any way.

Took me close to 2 years to go from beginner to get all 100 levels platinum medals (2 piece advantage).   The things i like about this shogi app are:  - play level is decent, plenty of skill needed to challenge most beginners/intermediates and maybe even some lower advanced players. - The graphics look very nice - Earning medals makes it fun to keep on playing - many levels have their own opening style and they application is mixing up some of the moves a bit to keep things interesting   Things that need some improvement: - I am a bit disappointed that the if i let my iPhone4s play against my Nexus7 tablet the iPhone always wins, even though it has a very much slower processor in it. The android version of this app doesn't seem to be optimized for multiple cores. - The ""give piece advantage"" games don't seem to have any ""opening move databases"", making them easier to win then it should.  - The online games vs computer (lv. 100-200) is too expensive. - i really would like a game customsetup/analyse function. Learning shogi just by playing without knowing strong/weak moves is tough.",5,5,1.1.2,2014-01-26 00:35:32,,

However, on the bottom of the screen (changing from menu to in-a-game-menu) I found all the features that I had thought missing. Thus, I am reflecting this in my edited review.  Pros: Everything. Game solid, AI solid, undo button, 1-99 challenge rating, great sound (which can be turned off), highlights potential moves for fast learning, AMAZING ""how-to"" help menu, has 2 player mode, has handicap mod for comp or player (or either player in 2 player).  Cons: Of the 5 or 6 boards I unlocked, only the first has English letters on the pieces, every other board style is ""original"" so english only speakers will have to memorize the japanses if they want to use other board types and know what pieces are what once the moves start happening.",5,2,1.0.1,2012-04-20 13:31:22,,
