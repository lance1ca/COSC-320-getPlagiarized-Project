Easy to finish, hard to get all achievements. If you're easily frustrated by not getting 100% then you may not enjoy the game, but if you like replaying the game and trying many different combinations then it's extremely satisfying to play and gives many hours of entertainment. There are so many subtleties in the expressions of the characters, and the puzzles are very clever. The hardest achievement to get is the ""about us"" one.",5,3,1.0.16,2020-12-19 14:04:58,,

I don't enjoy games where I'm randomly clicking around to progress it and only from there figuring out what to do. It feels repetitive, even with the different levels. I've played plenty of hidden object puzzle type games which I love & this one is more annoying than fun. I won't be sad when it ends & yet I love when I'm sad at a games end, since I didn't want it to because I enjoyed it that much. This for me was not that, sadly.",3,3,1.0.16,2020-12-16 15:49:23,,
