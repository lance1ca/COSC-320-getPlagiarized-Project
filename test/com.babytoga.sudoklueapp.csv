My only criticism with this version is the inability to remove the displaying of pencil marks. That feature is called ""Erase All"" in the PC version. If that were available I would give give stars.",4,0,1.0.4,2021-01-29 11:54:46,Great suggestion! Will look into adding that feature in the next release!,2021-01-31 07:36:09

But the interface is just.... Bad... Too many steps to add a number. Ideally let us select the number first and place it with 1 click after that. Also a bit hard on the eyes compared to other sudoku apps (the good ones without ads, that is).",4,0,1.0.4,2021-01-29 10:22:29,"Dear User, thanks very much for your feedback. We will definitely be taking suggestions like this into account as we enhance the interface in the future!",2021-01-31 07:39:06
