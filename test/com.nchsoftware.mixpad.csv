And I've mixed and produced over 100 songs I've made since then. My review of this app is not consistent and that's because the app hasn't been consistent. It has constantly changed up and been real frustrating as much as exciting at times I just paid the $16.99 for the master version and still having trouble and issues with stuff I thought would it been fixed like???

The latest version doesn't let you fast forward/rewind. The interface is harder to work with & the app takes up a great amount of unnecessary space with the way it saves its files. The mixer could be more fine tuned & the pitch corrector should be more detailed. A synthesizer plug-in should also be made available.,3,10,,2020-08-27 16:27:21,"Hello, We are sorry for any frustration this has caused. Your review has been forwarded to our Development Team.
