You have to completely close the game and restart all the way back over. Doesn't even save. You Should give everyone that you have charged for this game a refund.,1,0,1.6.3,2020-07-14 07:49:36,,

You dev's have put out enough games that you should be at least competent by now. Do you beta test at all? Anybody reading this should pass til this buggy mess is fixed.",2,0,1.6.1,2020-02-23 09:01:31,,
