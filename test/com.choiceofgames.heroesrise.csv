The sole romance option is almost nauseatingly 2 dimensional, and says you like this person before you even have a choice to... Not. Adding on, the way they address lgbt+ things are almost superficial. I've seen others complain about it being shoved down their throats, but to me it feels like it was put in last minute, feels basically like the creator doesn't actually care or know anything about the subject (like calling it orientationism which is like they're afraid of using actual terms)... it just feels gross, how it's included. I'm a gay trans guy and this just bugged tf outta me. I just didn't enjoy it. It's not bad, but just very.. set in stone story for yourself. What you choose doesn't change much besides end game rating, which wasn't satisfying like it should have been...
