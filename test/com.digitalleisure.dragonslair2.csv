I've never had a game tell me it was going to take seven or eight hours to download. My wifi hotspot on my Galaxy S7 usually has 30 260 megabytes per second download and most games download in a minute or less a big file takes two or three minutes. Even if this game were to use 8 gigs of storage I don't think my tablet has that much room so it should say insufficient storage and stop right there. So instead of wasting $5 because you'll be passed the one hour return time by the time the Gallant game downloads I just push refund. It's too bad I love the original Dragon's Lair game at the arcade. But I have downloaded it before and it doesn't work very good. I can't remember if I paid for it or not I guess I could type it in and see if I can download it if I paid for it once I should still be able to get it now. Anyways buyer beware about 90% of the people say it either is very glitchy or it doesn't work at all I wouldn't waste my money on it and it's not like five bucks is going to hurt me but I just don't like giving $5 away to someone for no reason. I won't do it to the bigger on the corner that's going to spend it on crack so why would I give it to this company that's probably going to spend it on crack.,1,0,1.010,2017-01-31 20:45:33,,
