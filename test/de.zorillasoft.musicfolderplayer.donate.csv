You'll love its' powerful, great-sounding playback, its lean, clean, familiar intuitive user-interface & features like gapless playback, quick BT sync to car stereo, equalizer and more. I've tried the top MP3 music players herein and was disappointed frankly. All were complicated and inflexible for my needs. Most looked like gaming UIs or are packed full of bells-and-whistles for DJs. That said, I now have 9,500+ songs sorted by genre in 40 folders filling 129GB on my phone's 200GB micro-sd card.  TWO TIPS:  1. Use an SD card device to transfer (large numbers of) music from your PC to your phones micro-sd card. Transfer time is about 1 minute per GB. Transferring my entire music collection to SD card took about 80 minutes. BTW, 20+ hrs was the estimated transfer time for 130 GBs directly into my phone's micro-sd card.  2. Turn off phone's WIFI-Mobile Data connections when transferring small number of songs directly into your phone. Notifications / actions will stop the transfer.

I've tried a number of others before finally settling on this one. I'm not interested in ridiculous skins that make my phone look like a 1980s ghetto blaster, or whatever. Just a simple, no frills, folder list that allows me to quickly navigate to the music I want. (Note to Devs: Figure out how to offer a playlist. It's the one glaring omission from this app... otherwise, it's great). Edit: playlists added. Thank you devs. Now I have an additional complaint/suggestion. Shuffle isn't really shuffle. Shuffle just plays the most often played songs first, so if you have a playlist with 200 songs and you only get through 20 of them, the next time you play that playlist, those 20 songs are going to play first because the app thinks you want to hear them more than the other songs... kind of frustrating because the other 180 songs are pretty good, too.

With over 1,500 music files and audio books and after downloading practically every player in the Google Store, I kept coming back to the free version of this awesome little program.  Finally saw the ad at the bottom of the screen telling me, HEY STUPID, BUY THIS APP!  (not really but that's what it seemed like)  $1.29 is just not really enough for what you get here, I would pay 10 times more.    I gave it 5 stars but would like to see one addition.  My vision isn't that great and I don't watch much TV and my greatest passion is music, I really need to have a way to change the font size and make it bigger on the screen to see the track info and where I am in my folders and files and I'm tired of getting nose to screen to see the lists.  If you could make that happen I would give this app 10 stars.    Keep up the good work and keep making this miracle app better.",5,0,1.5.3,2014-04-14 17:01:32,,
