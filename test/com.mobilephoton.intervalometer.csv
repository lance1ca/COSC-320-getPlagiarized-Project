Another feature I would like to see is a way to continue a time-laps project with the old pictures semi transparent, so you can calibrate your phone.

Placing it a little bit above the shutter button can still work. The built in timelapse calculator is a handy feature as well.  There are phones that already has built in timelapse feature but why still use this?   1. It enables you to shoot timelapse images in manual mode. Enables Long exposure timelapse  2. It enables you to shoot images beyond 1080p, higher res images means better timelapse quality. 3. It does not render your timelapse into video. Which means you have more creative control in post on what to do with the images.  Tested on LG G6",5,8,1.3,2018-04-09 07:11:33,,
