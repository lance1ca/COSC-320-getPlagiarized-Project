The pixel graphics are nice and the in-game music has improved, plus the game also runs a bit more smooth on my Nvidia Shield compared to older Kairosoft titles.  The gameplay is mostly the same thing as Game Dev tycoon but with a new setting and it works fine, i personally would like to see Kairosoft try something new and fresh with the gameplay aspect, since most games they make are mostly the same style of gameplay besides the changing setting which does impact the gameplay (an example: Dungeon Village). That is not to say that there aren't anything new, they did add something to the game, characters. Characters are vital to the Anime the studio produces and with 150 heads and 136 body types you can certainly create a whole slew of different characters, however you do not have all of the heads and bodies available from the start, instead you have to unlock them.  Should ya buy this ? if ya like GDS you'll most likely enjoy this game as well even tho it did not do anything new and fresh.",3,5,1.0.6,2015-05-12 02:13:04,,

Something new that it adds are rooms you can build, but most of them get pretty useless later on. You can also create characters for your shows, but only one can act in each anime you produce. Anime Studio Story has no treasure hunts or items like other similar Kairosoft titles and not much else to offer besides the ""find good combos and train your staff"" gameplay.   Something that really annoys me is that the game doesn't tell you if a combination you already used is good or not (like Magazine Mogul does), you will have to remember that or look it up in a guide.   Some kind of indication what kind of bonus the head and bodies for characters give would be nice as well.   Would have been nice if from mid-game on some more features would have been unlocked, like using 2 or more characters in one anime (MC and their rival, love interest or best friend) and having that influence the popularity of the show further, or being able to upgrade the rooms, to make them more useful in the end-game and stuff like that would have been nice.
