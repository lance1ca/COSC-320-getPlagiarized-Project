I am not going to be able to finish the game that I paid for because it will not let me click on the rocks in the beginning of the 5th episode.. Truly disappointed in this game. Any way to get a refund?,2,2,1.0.0,2019-09-02 12:39:27,,

Great story line and I like how you did the HO puzzles. This part of the game can usually be pretty boring but I'm actually enjoying them. Kudos and thanks for all your hard work!!,5,2,1.0.0,2019-05-06 11:13:58,,

Half way through the game the saddle disappears from your inventory and you cannot go any further in the game. I contacted the makers a few weeks ago and still haven't received a response. I also saw in other forums that this problem is not new. I wish I had read up on the game before purchasing. I am definitely going to stop buying these games sight unseen because they are offered at a discounted rate. The catch is you have to buy them outrite. I buy  2 to 3 games at a time because they are offered on weekly sales, but when you try to play the games they have problems. Buyer beware.....don't waste your money.",1,1,1.0.0,2017-01-16 20:21:36,,
