Do you have any suggestions?,1,0,1.9.3,2021-02-01 12:31:49,"Please try adjusting the projector settings to have high green values, and make sure that you're projecting neutral color walls (e.g. grey or white). The app looks for green pixels during that step, then takes the most green pixels to determine the bounds of the projector output.

Make sure you're in a dark room. Auto calibration automatically shuts off after 10 seconds if it can't auto calibrate, at which point you can move the blue corners manually over the projector output if something doesn't calibrate properly. Please let me know if this works for you.",2020-12-22 04:39:22

Will you be making adding more scenarios ? If not i would like to encourage it , you've done well on these , but a better hostage scenario would be good , shoot dont shoot . Thanks",5,1,1.9.3,2020-12-08 18:37:58,"Hi Jay, thanks so much for the review. If you could shoot me an email at estewart@crackshottraining.com, I'd love to hear more about the accuracy issue (as the latest app release attempts to address this). I do plan to make some more scenarios and would love to fill you in on some ideas if nothing else. Thanks again!",2020-12-09 07:44:23

I have now gone through two sets of batteries for my laser trying to calibrate this. I put the camera directly behind the tripod then stood behind both in a dark room (though the instructions suggest natural light, a bright room did not work well for me). At best, the reticle was only on the laser when I was shooting exactly on the middle. The further from the middle I shot, the further the reticle got from the laser. USELESS APP! Update: Dev never responded to my email.",1,1,1.6.1,2020-12-03 18:19:36,"Hi Evan, I released some updates for the app that takes the projector aspect ratio into account versus the phone aspect ratio. I see your device has a 18:9 aspect ratio, whereas most projectors are 16:9, this is probably why calibration was off. I patched this in the most recent update and I hope it helps resolve your issue.",2020-12-09 07:37:43

Your phone has a 18.5:9 aspect ratio, and most projectors are 16:9. The math ended up off the further you get from the middle because the phone resolution is wider than the projector's. I hope the latest updates fixes this issue for you, please let me know if does!",2020-12-09 07:39:40

I've never done a rating on any app, but the amount of time I wasted trying to get this to work warrants this. With the camera perfectly squared to the display, accuracy only exists marginally at the very center of the scene. The visible hits on the target are now barely visible on a screen which needs to be set so dim. This is not a tool as advertised or even qualify as a game.",1,1,1.5.0,2020-09-26 23:27:13,"Hi Rick, thanks for the feedback.The problem existed in a previous version (1.5.0) but has since been patched (1.6.1).

Please shoot me an email at estewart@crackshottraining.com. Probably whats happening is false positives due to the projector's brightness and glossiness of the wall.
