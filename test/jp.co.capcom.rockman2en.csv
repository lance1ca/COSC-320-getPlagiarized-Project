My main problem is that its next to impossible for me to not accidentally tap the back button on my phone causing the game to go to its menu screen. Its very irritating though i cant really blame the game i guess. I also had to adapt to a different playing style due to touch screen as opposed to a nes or ps2 controllers that ive used in the past for Mega Man games.
