Wolf explained the various ""menu"" buttons for Android phones which was a hard to find hardware button labelled ""Menu"" on the old smartphone but the Acer's ""menu"" button is a nonsensical icon accessed with a quick double tap (other smartphones use a long press) of the multitask touch button and isn't covered in the Acer's manual at all! With Wolf's help I was able to get into all of the program and he explained some other program features. A big plus is the ability to snap a picture, select an area of it (or all), adjust the colour/tonal properties, scale it down to a 320 x 256 SSTV image with decent detail, then add a text overly all on the fly! Especially useful for EMCOMM when no Internet/Wi-Fi is available to get images to back to the EOC. The old Kenwood VC-H1 is replaced by the new DroidSSTV + Android smartphones!

Tried decoding a typically radio-degraded robot36 transmission - nothing happened. Tried a digital acoustic recording of a B/W12 transmission I had created an hour earlier - nothing happened.  Nothing happened when I tried a similar Robot72 transmission. Tried optimizing volume levels and mic/speaker placement - nothing, several times.  I eventually got some data when I generated a Robot72 transmission live on my computer, whilst practically holding the mic next to the speaker. The app ignored the first ten seconds of it so it missed the VIS and assumed it was Martin2 instead, so it was incomplete AND wrongly decoded. History is broken too, only storing two lines of random pixels.  This is my first one-star review for an app for reasons other than design or utility. It didn't decode correctly under near-ideal conditions, so how can we expect it to work in the noisy, band-limited environment SSTV was designed for? Bad enough that functions don't work at all - it's worse when they try but generate garbage.  TX works though! The timer should be remaining not lapsed.  Refunded. Twice because  I had to buy again to post this review!",1,1,,2014-04-06 13:18:44,"I am sorry but as I wrote in the description and the manual, DroidSSTV supports the ham radio modes Scottie 1, Scottie 2, Scottie DX, Martin 1, and Martin 2 at this time.

Would think about refunding but unable to now. For the money should be able to decode robot 36. Does some strange things with the screen orientation. Also will not transmit in robot 36. *update - Screen orientation does work although you have to exit app and start again for change to apply. Will invest with hope robot-36 support will be added.,4,1,1.29,2013-11-30 10:08:42,"DroidSSTV supports the most common modes Martin 1 & 2 as well as Scottie 1 & 2.
