This game happens to blend both of these genres together seamlessly. I have just started playing but I love what I have been seeing so far. The combat system is pretty simple not visceral like Diablo but I can live with that, since Skyrim really never had a great combat system anyway and that's one of my favorite games of all time! This game gives you a huge map to explore which just makes me drool :D! I just got done going through the Serpent Pit and 100% it. I highly recommend playing this game with headphones; it is actually pretty immersive with the well-done audio and music. I animations of the character is okay, but I wish he wasn't leaning so much when he's running. It makes it look weird like he's about to fall over. Also, I played this game on the PC as well, and I wish they had an option for click to move/attack like Diablo. I am enjoying this game so much right now and can't wait to continue exploring it.

The graphics are retro, it can get a bit grindy when you are doing trade skills, and the combat is swarm ish action. Getting used to the control take a little.. but it comes in time. It has active save states and auto saves every 10 min is very helpful. Pros - NO IAP, NO ADS, NO TIME LOCK PROGRESSION - Solid Open world RPS with basically all you can ask for - Good controls for mobile ( twin stick style ) - Does a good job at tacking your quests - Has a Decent map - Large enough to not feel congested, but not too large to feel overwhelmed. -Individual skills go up based on use ( axe, sword, fishing ect. ) - Achievements ! Neutral - When you leave the map and come back all the monsters are back. I dont mind this on the over world.. but due to the amount of mobs they throw at you in dungeons it can be annoying. - The Trade skills seem a bit low % wise. ( you need 15 Fried Rat Tail, but the drop rate on the tails is 10% and making the dish is 15% when you start ) you can see how this may be a grind. - The skill use progression is good and bad imo.. good because the obv. Bad because if you find a really good axe 20 hours in and have only used swords... you have no skill for it and need to grind. Cons - It can seem a bit Grindy for some quests/skills - There are many many weapons.. but they all kinda do the same thing.. with different stats ( sword vs axe ) so yes there are alot of weapons.. but like in most games to claim ALOT of weapons ( im looking at you Borderlands 3 ) but only maybe 20 ( and even less being viable ) - The Dungeons are a bit cluttered and hard to navigate. Many many levers and gates all over. Can seem a bit like a maze, there is a Map which is very helpful but it doesn't show any stairs, chests, ability orbs. - This moves into the ability orbs.. they are a MUST to advance abilities.. however you have to 100% dungeons to ensure you get them all. This can be very daunting given that each time you go up or down a floor all the monsters are back.. and healing is hard to come by at the very start. OVERALL I'm giving this title 5 starts not because its perfect, but because compared to your other options this is the best you will find on mobile IMO. NO IAP , NO ADS , NO TIME LOCK RESTRICTIONS. its refreshing to see in this era of mobile cash grab games. Also this got 8.9/10 on Chon Mobile Gaming Monthly This is the highest a Mobile RPG has scored so hats off for that!!",5,5,1.21,2020-10-13 07:55:07,,

I might finish just here but only after few minutes I can set many other improvements compared to previous games, like better animations, picking up items, better UI overall...

It's much better than 9th dawn II. I do wish the pet trap and bait prices were slashed to half for the small ones and make it easier to trap small ones since we all know we will eventually go for the bigger ones. The game is a little unbalanced regarding the butterfly enemies when rescuing the nameless one because it's peers are much weaker and it doesn't even drop good loot to begin with. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Worth every penny.,5,10,1.07,2020-10-05 21:07:06,,
