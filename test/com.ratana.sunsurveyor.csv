Since recent installed it on my GETAC Z70 military specs tablet because of its professional GPS unit. This combination : Sunsurveyor with the GETAC make it the very best Sun / Moon / Milkyway surveyor ever. I also have Planit Pro and Photo Pills installed. Neither of them comes even close to the incredible user interface of Sunsurveyor. The accuracy of the app is as good if not better as the others. But as said the user interface is just the best of the best. All the information required to read and adjust settings in one screen without ever having to hop from screen to screen and back is just such a time saver. I use the app for my landscape and architecture photography and every now and then for scouting camp locations to see where I will have Sun or Shadow. It simply never fails. The app is not bloated with all kinds of extra info like 'magic' curves of Sun or Moon paths but gives you exactly that what is needed for the job. Over the years I had some contact with the developer Adam Ratana , always a most peasant conversation and he proofed to be very open to small suggestions. I am a professional photographer with 40+ years experience - now 'legally' retired and often realize that thanks to apps like Sunsurveyor I can make better photos where in the past even after a lot of endless calculations - I could just just missing 'the moment' the Moon for instance showed its face over a mountain. 100% recommended - don't be blinded by the marketing of the big colorful app makers.

Finally - continuous tracking of your position doesn't work at all, it's all but continuous, updating arbitrarily and with very poor accuracy.

I planned my night photo session 100% relying on Sun Surveyor. It was a textbook perfect night out. I did not waste a single moment. The app gives you details of the Blue, Golden hours, twilight and the most awesome 3D compass. I was able to plan almost to the minute my night photo session and was able to be at the locations I had to be at thanks to the information I gleaned from the app. I've learned from the author he is planning to add new features to the app which will make even more indispensable to have.
