Use it on Kodi via plugin, Linux from source, and on Android TV through the $3 app. One thing I've noticed on the Android TV app is I can not set tolerance levels, and it appears on TV it's not in sync with the music a lot. I'm questioning if it's only using mic as source on TV version which will fail and just use default out of sync sequence. I downloaded phone version and it does allow you to set mic, audio, or both. The sync issue on the TV build was checked with the new and old model Nvidia Shield TV (Android 9) using the Spotify app. Would be nice to confirm if it's an audio source issue or if tolerance tweaking would fix this.",3,0,7.2,2021-01-26 17:07:11,,
