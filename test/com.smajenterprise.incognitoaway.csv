I recommend using this app alongside something like BlockerX, which blocks adult content very well and can also prevent you from using the phone's built in browser. This means I can only use chrome on my phone and I cannot use incognito mode. I haven't given this 5 stars because I don't think it's worth the price you have to pay, especially when compared to BlockerX which has a free version which has as many features as this payed app. But this is a good app and thanks to the developers!",4,22,1.05,2020-04-22 06:05:00,,
