I don't know if it's an upgrade with this app or Chrome OS going to 72 (which had huge changes) but now portait mode works the way it should. The people behind the app contacted me and they were concerned about my problem and wanted to correct it. If you have the free version, splurge and get the paid, these people have earned it! LQLarry It's probably a good app but id doesn't work with a 2 in 1 chromebook. I was asked to explain what wasn't working correctly by Google (I think) so here is my problem. Landscape mode worked the way it should, I think, but portait mode did not give me all the buttons I needed to make the app functional. Nothing after the timing bar. No play/pause, no forward, no back back. Since I read mostly in portait mode this makes the app useless. I use another app that works good and I have no problems with it. I did purchase the Simple AudioBook Player and they hae said that they would refund me if I choose. The price is affordable so I'm not worried about the refund and it says tons about mdmt wanting to work with me so if they can get it to work I'll test it. I've read nothing but praise so it has to be a decent app to get a 4.8 rating.",5,2,1.4.9,2019-02-18 19:05:17,"If you are interested in fixing this problem or getting a refund, write me at mdmt.bh4e@gmail.com.",2019-02-06 10:14:16
