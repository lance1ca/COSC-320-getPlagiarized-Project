game on steam, I saw that the level menu was actually the sets of circles. 
This is extremely vague for mobile users though, and difficult to see. 
Maybe a small tutorial showing how to use that menu?",4,2,1.5,2018-05-10 06:44:59,Hey Keen - I'm looking into adding a button that allows you to lock orientation - thanks for that suggestion!

That said, for me the game is too short and limited to cost $3 (compared to other gaming apps). I feel like there was room for replay value that just wasn't executed, and there being only four areas disappointed me. I have been looking forward to getting this game for a while, so it was a let down when I realized it is more of a brief, but good, idea-type game, not a fully developed one. Even with staying in areas to find all items, I finished the game shortly after purchasing it.   That said, I liked that it wasn't some freemium nonsense and I really did enjoy the concept. I would be interested in a more extensive version of the game.  Edit: thanks for replying, not sure if I have the ability to reply so I am editing. I appreciate the active  interest in feedback, especially as a limited character space makes me seem rather short. One detail I noticed was the amazing complexity of the scenes, so I expected that, after the clued adventure, there would be a higher difficulty without clues, and sort of 'achievement' type things. E.g., 'find all 7 people with bags' or randomized sample subjects you'd have to find (e.g.,a golf tee). While the hints helped make the game enjoyable, they also had the double edge of making it almost too easy for some objects. However, finding all the necessary items really helped familiarize me with the scenes, so it would have been much easier for me to find random objects without clues on a 'higher difficulty' replay. I am not sure how the coding would work, but even just giving different objects group identifiers and then randomly pairing those could make for interesting, potentially limitless extra play (e.g., 20-30 possible groups, each subject may belong to as many as 5 of those; initial coding work could then automate randomly generated find its like 'find all folks with both a bag and hat'). It seemed like there was already individual tagging for objects (as different ones made different noises) so I am thinking additional tagging would be 100% possible. And that would make me feel much less uncertain paying a dollar for each level, because I could still search and find things after completing the 'adventure'.",3,1,1.4.1,2018-03-17 20:29:14,"EDIT: I really appreciate you taking the time to elaborate on your feedback, Ashley. Some of your ideas will likely be added to the game later in one form or the other, but we purposely didn't make this a procedurally-generated game because that would remove the 'character' the targets and hints have. But... stay tuned!",2018-03-18 08:26:31

The artstyle and quirky behaviors are tremendously engaging. This brings the Where's Waldo concept to a whole other level with a charming and interactive world. This is exactly the type of soothing and relaxing game that gets your brain going without having to worry about frantic quick actions. Really well done.,5,32,1.4,2017-12-15 06:23:28,,

Hidden Folks is great though. I like how the descriptions give you a hint for each figure you need to find. Also, you can chase rabbits around a campsite.
