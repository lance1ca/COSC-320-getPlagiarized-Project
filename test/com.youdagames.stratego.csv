Like how the game moves pieces that you did not order, this is because you are suposed to drag not click. Others say that the game cheats by knowing all your pieces, this may be true for the campaign but so what, you know the AI'S pieces anyway. The regular battles do not cheat tho the AI either guesses rembers the uncovered ones or sees you move to determine what rank your piece is.Now the final complaint I saw was the price of the game, the game cost money and in the game as well to unlock more levels ($0.99). This cost money but if you are a stratego pro like me that wants to challenge the best stratego players, just suck it up and buy this cause its one of the smartest stratego AI I have ever seen.

On mobile phones there is a small skull in the top right corner during battle and quick battle.
Press that and you will see the 'Graveyard' that shows the pieces you and your opponent lost.
