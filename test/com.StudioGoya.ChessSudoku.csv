Thanks for the response, keep making these apps and I'll keep buying them. <3 Love the handcrafted puzzles created for this app, thanks for the hard work Mark and Simon.",5,1,1.0,2020-03-04 13:05:25,"Hi Bradley, 

You can disable the highlights by setting ""Highlight Restricted Cells"" to off in the Gameplay Settings menu. Also, you might want to try out the ""Tool"" Control Method, it might be more in line with what you're looking for. 

Cheers,
