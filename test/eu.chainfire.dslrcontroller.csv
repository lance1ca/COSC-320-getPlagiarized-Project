I have to say it gives terrific freedom being able to sit in the cool inside air and snap pictures with the phone when my camera is set to shoot wildlife outside.   As an fyi, this may have something to do with my Android version, but recently I'd been having a real issue getting the app to fully connect to the camera. It would say it saw a camera but would not connect. After hours spent experimenting, I found it was the phone connecting to the the tp-link that had an odd glitch. Because the tp-link wifi connection does not actually give internet access, the phone would connect fine but then after a few seconds it would give a pop-up saying the connection had no internet access. The problem was I had to click ""YES"" to close that pop-up! If I simply went on into the app it would never finally connect to the camera. All the times I ignored it and it went away by itself, it wouldn't connect. So, clicking ""yes"" on the pop-up makes it work now every time.

As long as I shoot in landscape orientation everything is perfect. But, the time I put the camera in portrait orientation, the app fills the scene horizontally and I need to rotate the mobile to see it properly (still with all on-screen controls in a horizontal orientation). Even if I could manage the mobile display somehow, I cannot rotate the TV every time I change the orientation! The app needs a thoughtful implementation in the portrait mode. As it will be most useful in a studio environment and most of the time we shoot in portrait orientation, the purpose is not served if it is useless in portrait mode.

But once I purchased the W-E1 WiFi SD card it no longer worked for me. I thought it was an incompatibility issue with the app. Therefore I  gave it a lower rating simply because of that. But it turns out not to be the case. While the WiFi SD card is inserted, the USB is disabled. The WiFi SD card has to be removed in order to enable the USB transmission. Once done, the app come up again and works just fine. So my apologies to the developers of this app. That was a mistake on my part. The only thing I see as a weakness is the small latency that can occur. But that is NOT an app issue, that is simply the draw back of sending video over USB. I find the best use for this as a controller, configuring the settings on my camera remotely, while streaming video to an HDMI display. I would love to see a waveform and vecterscope added to this app. That would really make this app complete and make it a powerful controller when paired with a second HDMI display, like on a jib setup.",5,12,1.02,2016-11-14 10:08:07,,

Like, for example, you open up the app, camera is connected, works pretty much great. Now, if you actually get out of the app, whilst multitasking or just accidentally, chances are that when you go back it just can't find your camera.

I think it's great that I can have a Nexus 5 plugged into the camera and a Nexus 7 providing monitoring via WiFi at a good distance away. The number of controls and options (including 5x and 10x zoom on your focus window, and being able to sync your camera's clock to the phone - nice) is icing on the cake.

I do a lot of time lapse and astrophotography . This  allows for time lapse set up,  start and just walk away while it does it's thing. The ability to do astrophotography on android devises is a big plus with me. I have tried other remote controllers (android) and they simply cannot hold up to this app's power of control with my camera. The Canon 6D not having a articulated rear screen is no longer an issue. Not only does this simple replace the rear screen, I have a much larger screen to view and can sit comfortably at my work station while taking photos. On cold winter nights I can sit inside where it is warm and control the camera using WiFi where it is outside attached to one of my telescopes. This includes viewing the results and changing settings as needed. I am still learning it's abilities and have begun using it in video. My hat is off to the development team!

Biggest issue: not saving jpgs to the tablet (raw+jpg mode). Reviewing a shoot has to be done from camera; android gallery app can do this and it's free.  Second biggest: freezes for about 10 seconds between the main screen and review screen (maybe cable length is a factor?).  Niggles: Follow Shot is my most used feature but takes too many clicks to set up. Has to be configured to full screen on every use.  Can't review previous images in Follow Shot screen. Painfully slow when switching screens. In Full Screen the app still doesn't use entire screen, leaving navigation bar. Image review screen doesn't use whole screen even in full screen mode, still shows image info.  I am one of many people who just need an image review (follow shot) app without Live View functionality. Maybe you would consider spinning that off as separate app? Hard to believe that such a frequently used feature of tethered shooting, a staple of EOS Utility, so hard to find for android - DSLR Controller by far the best attempt so far.  I'll test a bit more but not sure if it's a keeper in it's present state.",2,0,0.98.3,2013-05-31 18:03:11,"Tested on Nexus10+5Dm3. Did you actually configure the app to save JPGs to tablet?

A regular field monitor costs about the same if not much much more than a tablet. And that's for a standard 7 inch screen that's often times sub HD, with the Nexus 10 (what I'm using) you have a 10 inch 2K screen with longer battery life and full camera control. It's almost crazy more people don't use this!!!  Here's the one catch, the lag. It does lag a bit which makes run and gun shooting tough to say the least. I don't really do that kind of shooting as I usually will set up shots for scripted and partially scripted shoots. So for me it's really great.  If you absolutely need a filed monitor for run and gun/ fast moving subjects, it will be a better option. If you use one occasionally during interviews or other non fast moving situations, this is an incredibly amazing option. If they figure out the lag issue before the first official release then there is no reason not to get this instead of a dedicated monitor for the control features, screen size, price, screen resolution.

I practically had to do nothing to get it to work with my rooted GS3 with a cheap OTG cable from Amazon. What I got it for is so that i have a bigger screen for live view while shooting video, since with the MKII, the screen is so small that it's hard to gauge if your subject is in sharp focus (I use manual focus on my MKII since if you put it on auto-focus it spazzes out and makes lots of noise) . For this is works great. One small issue is that while shooting video there's no way to easily get the onscreen controls off the screen quickly, I may just not be seeing the setting. There's a setting for it but you need to go to that setting *after* you press record. Also the onscreen image exhibits a bit of moire; I assume this is an artifact from the program's interpolation/scaling down method. I hope that this is something the developers address in an update, but its a small gripe; i'm still able to judge my focus point a LOT better with the bigger screen.

With my kit though it's faultless, and I'm surprised it's not been released properly already.  More for anybody considering this, star ratings are fairly meaningless at this point and promises of ""extra star if you fix/implement/add"" etc are even more pointless than usual, it's beta software and not really ripe to review.

Having pressed the refund key for this product, Google failed to acknowledge it, so I was left with the software.  After writing the first review I noticed that my Canon 5d Mk2 battery was on the last segment (25%), so I recharged it and tried again.  My tablet is an Asus Transformer with keyboard (needed for the USB), and the link is a Canon USB cable. The software works much more reliably with a fully charged battery, albeit there was still a glitch.  After altering the white balance to K and entering 3200 (I was indoors, electric light), the software produced about twenty shots before I stopped it by depressing the software's onscreen shutter button.  It would have been a nuisance had the memory card been full, but otherwise the software worked well and for the price (about 1% of Canon's wireless alternative) I can recommend it - so long as your camera battery is fully charged.",4,0,0.91,2012-04-09 13:08:12,,
