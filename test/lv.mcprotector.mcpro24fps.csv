Because different phone have different feature that worked properly. Gamma curve selection is many. But not all is good for your camera sensor. Gamut selection other than Rec.709 is bad because it converted from Rec.601 color primaries original. Audio bitrate is many. But it is useless because audio frequency is limited to 17 KHz. Better stick to 160 Kbps. Manual wb adjustment is bad. Sometimes I can't get target 6500K when using wb card.,3,5,034d,2021-01-26 06:18:37,,

Also, there is one thing that keeps me for switching to Filmic Pro - in Filmic Pro you can change framerate settings with exposure for example 1/10 or even 1/3s. Yes it gives lower framerate, but very useful for artistic interpretations or filming in low light. Would love to see this implementation in mcpro24fps in the future!",5,2,032,2020-09-17 00:41:24,,

Only major flaw is the lack of exposure options. By default auto should leave shutter at 180deg and control auto exposure with ISO and only change shutter slower if max ISO is reached or faster if min ISO is reached. Great to have manual and auto but auto should be more intelligent (not increase shutter speed and ISO like it does) and also be able to lock shutter and use auto ISO only.,5,3,030,2020-07-11 19:56:07,"Thanks for review.
