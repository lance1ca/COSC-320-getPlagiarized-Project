Look: The game looks totally accurate to the new art style with all the love and polish put into it. Feel: While the AI will pose a moderate challenge to seasoned players, it is enough not to discourage new players until they understand the game and move on to human opponents. Playability: Sadly, at this time the multiplayer does not work on Android versions as Google+ was the only way to play online with others on this app (which was last updated back in 2017). This is why my review went from 5 stars to 3 because the replay ability greatly depends on this aspect. There isn't even an option to connect locally on the same network or just input an IP address to play online with others easily. Hopefully the Developer hasn't abandoned this project and is working on a way for us to continue playing. Overall: If you love the game and want to play it with a moderate challenge or want to table swap when visiting people to play with then get it. If you are looking for a way to play with others over distance, the only way is via iPad or the free Java version.",3,2,2.6.4,2020-05-17 14:40:55,,

This is one of my favorite games and this app is a beautiful version of the Valley Games edition.  I like to cast it to my TV using Chromecast so I get a huge board to play on.    This app runs smooth on my Nexus 7 (2013) and I have not had any issues with the software.  I like the graphics and the animations of the pieces run smooth as well.  I also like that cross platform play is available.  Excellent job!,5,0,2.5.4,2015-10-27 08:42:15,,
