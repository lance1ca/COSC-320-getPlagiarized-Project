Great job on the mobile side as well.  Works well with S5 neo - but is a huge battery strain.  Interface works well.  AI is at times frustrating.  It's pretty easy to win with no handicap,  so I usually put a 10 handicap for the opposing side I am playing which will make the outcome of the game unknown.   I am wondering if this handicap also affects the dice roll as it gets SUPER FRUSTRATING the coup attempts.  I have documented over 80 rolls/battles cards, etc..  I average 2.65 per coup roll, AI averages 3.9!!  Huge difference and at times makes it nearly impossible to win. They win nearly all war cards, and don't get me started on the imbalance of the re-alignment roles (can never win if even - I documented 15 losses in a row....when both +2).      This is my biggest complaint of the game.       2nd complaint would be the time AI takes to complete moves.  Perhaps it is the speed of my phone.  AI often makes ridiculous moves such as using a 1 ops card to battle a 3 country (and will win).  AI will often lose by nuclear war, and AI often seems to know which cards in my hand especially on headline phase (probably like playing someone really good with a good memory).",3,2,1.1.1,2018-11-16 11:22:41,,

It 
is a fantastic themed recreation of the Cold War, and expertly blends theme 
with gameplay. Very few games tell a story in the way that TS does. The app 
is, in general, a quality implementation of the game. The interface is 
excellent for such a complex game, Unfortunately, this app is marred by a 
number of bugs which have gone unfixed for a long time (the same is true of 
the Steam release). While these bugs are rare, they are almost always 
game-ruining: the game does not leave much room for error, and the bugs 
that are left usually cause major issues. The experience with the Turn Zero 
DLC is worse, and I strongly recommend that you do not purchase it. Enough 
of the cards are buggy, and effectively work contrary to their text, that 
almost every game is unbalanced by one of them. The AI is an excellent foe 
for new players, capable of defeating new to moderately experienced 
players. It does suffer, however, from occasionally making some 
spectacularly good moves, and it should pose no challenge to a seasoned 
expert. If you are a strong player, you can try to build challenges for 
yourself against the AI, such as dominating every region simultaneously, 
never couping, or reaching final scoring with the USSR controlling the UK.",4,1,1.1.1,2018-07-28 23:34:06,,

and find people to play with rather easily via the multiplayer feature. 
Cons: 1 - On certain devices, card text isn't readable because of the 
aspect ratio. But fairly seasoned players should be able to remeber all the 
cards just by looking at the picture; 2 - No way to skip animations; 3 - No 
game log export Food the cons and it's a 5 for sure.",5,3,1.1.1,2018-07-08 08:50:59,"Hello,

AI is quite annoying, have ""lost"" far too many games because of AI ignoring the defcon level.  Particularly a problem  when playing as the USSR. Resolving this issue would be a major improvement.***  This a great conversion, fully recommend it. There are occasional glitches - I've played a couple of games where its my action round and I can select cards but no action is possible (no option for how to play the card appears). The AI does have a tendency to ignore the defcon level leading to alot of games ending in nuclear holocaust, often with a message saying the AI side still won for some reason. So there are a few things to iron out but it's still great and I've spent ages playing it.",3,0,1.1.1,2017-12-21 01:03:40,,

Playing the AI is fun. It plays subpar, especially in the mid or late game where it seems lost, but with luck it can still win and still presents a challenge enough to keep the tension high. It also allows for handicaps so if you're winning too easily you can spot it extra influences or if you're struggling you can do the same for yourself.  It features online play and a rating system so you can play people at your level or people on your friend's list.  On the negative side it is prone to crash when starting a new game or continuing an older game, but it has never crashed during a game for me.  Also, some of the buttons are so small on the screen on a phone, particularly the ones that tell you what events are active, that it can be hard to click on them and read the text. Finally, it has in-app purchases where you can buy promo cards and the optional cards from the deluxe edition. The in-app purchases are nearly as much as the game itself. It's kind of cheap that they did it that way. They should just give you everything straight up. What's nice vs the board game is you can readily see the state of each region (it provides a meter), it keeps track of everything) and it highlights valid moves and warns you of defcon 1 or scoring card blunders.
