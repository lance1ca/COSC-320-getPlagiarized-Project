It was nice and long (for me) and took a couple of days to play. I also liked the bonus game which continued the story logically. I got a couple of ""this video cannot be played"" messages during the bonus play but nothing actually stalled and the scenes played just fine. The artwork was really nice throughout although a few objects were buried in dark spots. I enjoyed the story which was pretty straightforward, not obtuse or full of endless ""walking"" like some games. The clues and places to play the objects were usually nearby, within a location or two from where it was found. Overall, this game is well thought out and quite entertaining for a casual player.",5,5,1.0.0,2014-01-18 13:15:57,,
