I watched the free course with camera in hand and already I feel more confident. The courses cleared all the junk out if my head and put everything in order and perspective. I am a pretty serious amateur and offer my services FREE to anyone. But I still want to give as professional a portrait as possible and these cards and courses have put me many steps forward in my goals. Thank you Chris Bray and team!,5,3,1.01,2021-01-04 12:47:52,,
