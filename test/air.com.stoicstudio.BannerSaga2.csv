EVERY decision has an impact on the story flow, just as every decision will impact the battles as well: allocate your 'Renown' (the game's currency) to buy food for your clan, or use it to level-up a combat character?

Impressive game, very immersive. I could feel the pain of people in the caravan and felt constantly fearful of making choices. It's hard to be a leader.  About android port. Here are some points.  Good: everything works. No matter how sluggish and how accurate you thumb must be. You can do it. Bad:  1. Loading times are very long. 2. Combat setup was a torture. When I had to place units before the combat started I had to be a surgeon. I would always misclick and swap places with another character. Very annoying. 3. Sometimes units are all meshed together and it is very hard to click on the right target or the right action. 4. Interface need to be larger for android. I felt like threading a needle. 5. Not sure if the game works offline. I could only connect on my WiFi at home and not on mobile internet for some reason.   Some gameplay recommendations: 1. Found food overrated. There was never enough, I had to spend all the money on it and I felt no punishment for choosing not to stock up on it later. 2. Don't like the design choice of having one currency for everything - leveling up your characters, buying items and buying caravan supplies. 3. The ending was too abrupt. No closure of any kind.

I don't know if it's just because I made poor choices along the way, and I accept that these are tough games, but I'm now near the end and my secondary team are woefully underpowered against the opposition, even after lowering the difficulty.

Currently I'm stuck on the loading screen that will not load is telling me it needs to download to more things in order for the game to be able to be playable and it will not load. For the past two days it's been stuck on the screen. I reinstalled the app and it's still the same thing. There's also the issue of switching out of the app into anything else completely bricks the game. If I go to take a call or I switch to another app as soon as I go back to the banner Saga and I'm in a match the screen goes black and the only thing that I can see are my characters and the enemy characters on the screen the movement grid no longer exist. Just a black screen and my characters and in this game if you can't move you can't play. At this point I've paid 5 bucks for a loading screen and I'm not getting my money's worth. I played this game on Steam and enjoyed it immensely and I figured having it on my cell phone would be a good look unfortunately that hasn't been the case thus far I would gladly change my recommendation if these issues were fixed s*** identity change my recommendation at this point if I could actually play the game but that's just not the case. I'm using a Galaxy Note 8 on Sprint network not that that should matter I've downloaded all of the files over WiFi or at least attempted to download them over WiFi and it still doesn't matter.

Strange design decision in battles: Regardless of how many or few characters are fighting on each side, one of your characters tajes a move, then one of theirs. This has the strange result that you have to leave opponents almost dead, so that on their move, they lack the strength to do much damage. But consider Crit, or any other skill that randomly increases damage: If you accidentally kill an opponent that you meant to wound, you have effectively strengthened your opponent, because the remaining characters are moving more often than if that character was still alive. This is insanity. One star less for that.  The other star I took off for the long wait times on Android.  I also wasn't thrilled by the abrupt, and anti-climactic ending.

My phone often screen locks due to inactivity on account of the load times. This really is extremely slow.
