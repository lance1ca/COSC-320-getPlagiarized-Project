Biggest flaw in this app was the letter tracing, the letters are hard to trace because they are a bit too small on the phone and also on my kids 7"" tablet. If the letters were larger I would give this 5 stars.",4,2,1.1,2015-09-02 20:00:23,,

It's very helpful for children learning to read and write in such an interactive way. Hats off!,5,1,1.1,2013-10-21 21:47:46,,
