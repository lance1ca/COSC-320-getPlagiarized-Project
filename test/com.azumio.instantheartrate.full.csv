Given that this is not designed for any sort of medical use I don't feel it's fair to hold that data for an extra fee. That's just my opinion and maybe I'm tired of finding too many apps that want to get a monthly fee out of me. It does seem like the program is Well written for what it does,3,0,,2016-07-18 10:37:56,,

You have to subscribe to the premium version at a substantial rate to get any useful records, but that is reasonable to compensate the developers for their time and ingenuity. However the subscription is not always effective. I wanted to download my very first measurements, but got a totally blank link from Azumio.  Click here to see the report linked to a page that said ""NO DATA AVAILABLE IN THIS REPORT""!!!!!!!!! Following a second measurement after finding that useless result, the report was downloaded although it did not contain the comments or notes I made immediately after the measurements were taken.  That was surprising, but worse still, I had to re-enter my name and birthdate.  No problem with my name, but using a scroll wheel for a birthdate in 1943 was tedious to say the least.  It had already been done the first time and really I should not have to do it a second time.  It should default to the first details.  At the very least it should default to the year of the first details.  Why anyone thinks a scroll wheel serves a useful purpose I do not know.

I wish there was more info and things you can do within the app itself though.  Also the adds on the application are too close to the menu option button's.  I've never had any errors or problems with it as far as it not working. Another plus is it saves every single heart rate and you can put descriptions on each one with the date and time attached to it. I highly recommend this application over any other one.,5,2,2.6.1,2015-03-20 00:56:10,,

Only problem is that sometimes at the end of the measurement it will jump up and give you a final reading that's higher than the true rate. ie: the pulse will be 70 through the whole measurement then suddenly jump and give you a final of 92. Overall a great app. A quick way to check your pulse and the variations of the individual beats.,4,0,2.5.7,2012-09-08 20:01:22,,

I have asthma and sleep apnea and I'd love to see this addition to an already great application. It was able to read everyone's pulses that I tried it on, showing the app around to my family although some people had to readjust their fingers on the camera and it took a false start or two to get a solid reading. That's a hardware limitation though I think and the fact that you can even do this on a cellphone with no external hardware is truly a great sign that developers out there are using these devices to their full potential. Keep up the good work and please, add oxygenation levels if at all possible. That alone would secure a permanent place on my phone for this app.  Also, to those reviewers that put their fingers over the flash and complain about it burning them.. try not putting your finger over the led, hm? My led is right next to my camera lens, I got burned the first time being stupid and I learned not to put my finger over both the lens and the flash. I didn't write a bad review, guess what?
