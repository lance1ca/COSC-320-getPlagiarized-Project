Space plan also has a charming and funny story that is well worth the play through and always makes you feel your clicks have real meaning and you're actually making progress in the game. The game also has no microtransactions and instead you only pay the flat purchase fee to get the game. Good for you guys and good for the consumer!

The story was absolutely awesome, very metaphysical and great for anyone who likes to entertain the idea of infinite realities. The game took about 3 days to complete, but only because you do have to wait. That being said, the ending is well worth the wait. One of the most moving and chilling, visually beautiful movies. I even took a couple screenshots for backgrounds. They also give you the option to replay the ending or start the game over completely. At first, the game may seem uninspiring and limited, but after a couple hours of playing it evolves into something completely different than you previously thought.

To start it's a simple clicker game. Many of the mechanics have been done before in some form or another in other games but this isn't bad. Instead Spaceplan does something interesting; it weaves a story. I never really found myself looking forward to getting upgrades just to make more money. I found that I was excited to see what twist the game had for me when I made it over a challenge. So others might complain about the lack of features or simple mechanics but they missed the entire point of the game... the story. I can say that I beat this game in 4 days and once you beat it the first time the second play through isn't as exciting but I would still pay $3 for any game this brilliantly designed. I'm glad to know that even mobile game devs can still make thoughtful projects that combine story and mechanics in meaningful ways. Also the music is really good.
