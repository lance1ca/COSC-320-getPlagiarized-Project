mic connected to whatever device you're using.",4,1,1.3.0,2018-06-25 16:47:27,"Thank you so much!
What custom options are you looking for?
Of course an external mic helps but a quiet environment and the device mic is more than enough to get your melodies down.",2018-07-04 06:16:03

transient detection. Perhaps a function to tell the app when a note or hit 
starts and ends. Playback can also get buggy when using the menu system 
too. In the right environment (I.e. My acoustically treated studio) it 
works fine, but I could use any number of more powerful music making tools. 
For this to be truly a great app it needs to have better detection when 
there is audible background noise so I can use it out and about, I think 
some simple gate functions would help this considerably. In my humble 
opinion this app has some huge potential but is not quite there yet. Please 
keep going!!! :)",3,2,1.3.0,2018-05-30 06:45:44,"Thank you very much for your great feedback!
User function to set start and end time is a great idea.
User menu interrupting playback: Will try to find a device like yours to test on but we have tested this running smoothly on much less powerful devices.
Background noise: Like you said you just need a quiet place and it works.
Thanks again!",2018-06-01 00:27:20
