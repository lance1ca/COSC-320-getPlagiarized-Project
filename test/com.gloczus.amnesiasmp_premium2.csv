it and reloading solved the problem but it happened quite a few times. Not 
a huge problem. Anyway, so far the stories are interesting! Loved the art 
and sound. Haven't played many fully-voiced otome games like this, and I'm 
glad this one was my first! A super pleasant experience, I will definitely 
buy Hakuoki as well and hopefully the developer will release more of 
these!! Would definitely buy all Edit: Finished all the routes awhile ago 
but after playing a few other otome games (mainly on ps vita) I realized 
Amnesia is really worth it for its price and storyline! I wish you would 
bring more english versions over !",4,10,1.0.3,2018-07-03 05:32:26,,
