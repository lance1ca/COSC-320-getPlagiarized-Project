I've had this one wishlisted for awhile because I was having a hard time justifying such an expensive app (as opposed to other apps I find expensive at $5.00..) I worried how limited the gameplay was due to being an app. I can't give it a 5. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic game. The music is good, the farm is nice, we didn't lose out on fishing, and mining. Etc etc. I was not a fan of some of the characters. The harvest goddess is very full of herself. The carpenter dad has, what I assume to be a very strong accent, but his children don't? The mine is very very boring, and without a half way point save is kind of too much. I find myself around floor 40 and I'm falling asleep. Why cant we elevator down to each tenth floor or something? I both like and hate that I can grow whatever almost all year long. I've already gotten married by fall of the first year. I didnt have to work too hard towards it which is okay. All in all its worth the purchase price. If you like harvest moon, you'll most likely like this game, but you will find it slightly lacking in ways you wouldn't expect it to. Think of SNES version basically. It's a great game, but you know that better could have been done. Especially since our phones can withstand graphics and videos usually, I wasn't expecting n64 harvest moon, but even something similar to the 3ds versions of harvest moon would have been a bit more preferable. For the price though, as I understand it comes down to budget, and time given to create the game, it's worth it. You're not getting a sub par game with bugs and glitches, and I hope they do release updates and kind of give the game a bit of an upgrade, but it's definitely fun to play. I have gotten my money's worth. I'd love to see some upgrades for the farm. It's a lot of farm land and not a lot of buildings.",4,23,1.6,2018-09-27 20:54:14,,

It is well worth the money! There are a few changes that would make the game slightly better... 1. Make food cheaper. That was a early on problem in the game. Food was just too expensive! (Ps. Make it so you can use wheat to cook flour. Something like 2 wheat makes flour.) 2. Add a journal with the schedules of all the shops. You should unlock the schedules as you meet the owners. The journal should also include the villagers' likes and dislikes. 3. When you have your kids, they seem rather useless as they grow up. I think that you should tweak it so that you can assign jobs to kids such as planting seeds, watering crops, fishing, removing weeds, chopping seeds, etc. 4. Another thing with kids, you should give them their own stats. If you give them a job they should get tired and loose hearts and stop working at one heart unless you give them food. They should also have relationships (not including between you and them) and be able to get married (with the player's consent of course). 5. As I've gotten into mining it gets a bit boring. Yes, I have enough food to make it to level 100 but I can't bring myself to do it. In my opinion it seems like a chore. This happens around level 50. I would love it if you would add some sort of treasure or achmovement for level fifty. For every 10 levels after that you might get a random item. I think that would add a bit more motivation to mining. 6. Your character should age a little every year. I know there are already birthdays but you should add evidence of the aging in your character's appearance. 7. I would also want another house upgrade with 2 extra small beds, or a bunk bed, so that kids can grow up to adults. Maybe it can cost like 1,000,000 dollars or a little less. Again this is a great game but I think a couple tweaks will make it a whole lot better. (Ps. Adjustment 2,3, and 4 are the ones I want the most!)",5,3,1.6,2018-01-06 20:36:39,,

First of all, not worth the $10. This game needs a lot of polishing. First, most items don't have a distinctive graphic design, all tools look like hammers in the menu, all minerals you collect look the same, a lot of the items placed on the environment look like ""stickers"" instead of physical objects. I feel like it lacks events when compared to previous games. There's only  small plaza, a mountain, and your barn in the game (not much to explore). I feel like this game lacks the natural feel of previous Harvest Moon games. I contacted costumer support to report a bug were the game does not save sometimes and to give feedback some feedback, never got a response. The menus, the dialog boxes, the health status bar, and many other object look underdeveloped. It's unfortunate cause I've been a Harvest Moon fan from childhood, and this game is not it anymore.
