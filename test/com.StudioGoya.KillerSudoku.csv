There's some really neat logic and it can be fun. But when I get stuck, the hints aren't always very helpful. Sometimes they can be rather cryptic (see what I did there?) and I have no idea how they came to the conclusion they did. They also tend to use run on sentences which can make it harder to understand, and I'm a native English speaker. With the puzzles being so difficult and hints not very helpful sometimes, -1 star.
