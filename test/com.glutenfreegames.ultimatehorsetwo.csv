Snow leopards are only found in the Himalayan mountains in the SNOW! hello? They are NOT in American grasslands. #3. The landscape could be made richer and more stylized like your old games #4. The animal scale sizes are all wrong. Other than my complaints. The idea of a horse sim is AWESOME but i hope you make it better.,3,7,1,2020-10-17 11:35:24,,
