It's KILLING THE EXPERIENCE as it is TOO CLOSE TO THE BACK BUTTON so everytime I need to go to the next thread, and I hit the back button by mistake, I exit the comments completely back to the front page! Argh! This doesn't happen with Relay coz their Up/Down buttons are floating a bit higher and they're bigger. Also, Relay has the advantage of saving your spot in the comments (until you open a new one) and the comment pane doesn't have to reload every single time if you back out of it by mistake. God forbid you've read until the second last thread and exit it by mistake and have to go through it all again to find your spot. Seriously, this issue is teeth grindingly annoying and I honestly am considering going back to Relay only because of this. Even left a comment about this to Dev on a Reddit thread months ago. But Dev doesn't seem as responsive as before. Also, there's no jump by Search in the comments like Relay. Old Review many months back: Thought I'd never use anything after Relay, well, I thought wrong! The 1 thing stopping me from making this my full time client is the lack of filters in comments (the famous Relay fab button). It's nice to jump from thread to thread in Slide comments, but nothing beats the choice of jumping comments based on Time, OP, Gilded, AMA & my personal fave, by Search.
