Yet, one semester into Hebrew and there were rogue flashcards in my car, jacket pockets, book bag, and scattered about my office. This app does an amazing job of determining which words come easy and those I need to work on. Its also a great way to learn new words: I typically start with the multiple choice option, then move to the ""spelling"" feature (going from more easy to more challenging). The app allows you to break large ""decks"" (say 100 or so words) into smaller intervals of cards (I use 10 card intervals.) As you move through the intervals, it keeps the more challenging words and replaces learned words with new cards. It has worked incredibly well for  Hebrew: I use the google handwriting keyboard to ""write in"" the Hebrew words en lieu of learning the Hebrew keyboard. It also records your pronunciation of the words which helps with learning words without vowel marks.   The features are endless: on the one hand, it takes some time to really navigate through the maze of settings (the help feature is handy and well organized), on the other, you can modify the app to work in whatever way suites your needs. Ultimately, the strongest feature of the app is its use of varied approaches to learning and memorization. In other words, it does more just flipping virtual cards.",5,11,3.1,2017-01-29 02:03:38,,

It is very polished & pretty easy to navigate through. However, one thing that limits it's use FOR ME is the fact that IT WILL ONLY USE THE ""TEXT-TO-SPEECH"" ON A LIMITED AMOUNT OF WORDS. So, if you have a question or answer that is over the ""letter characters"" limit (which is around 2 or 3 avg. sentences), then the text-to-speech will end abruptly. As someone who usually studies on ""the-go"", this limited feature was a big negative for me......   For this reason, I have made the choice to primarily use the  ""AnyMemo"" Flashcard app which is FREE, is also a great app, AND has no such ""text-to-speech"" limit. However, I still use Flashcard Deluxe for decks that involve pictures.  IF, there was no ""text-to-speech"" character limit, then Flashcard Deluxe would definitely be my first go-to app.   Hope this helps someone........",4,1,1.0.7,2013-03-03 17:07:35,,

Not too bad to input directly on my phone, but the easy syncing with Google Docs makes input on the computer a breeze. You can add new cards to an existing deck from Google Docs, too, and still keep all your statistics.  Spaced repetition is fabulous for learning. Breeze through the stuff you know and spend your time with what you don't know yet.  Great customer support. So far any question I've had has already been answered by the dev in the support forums.
