In my own opinion, I think it would better if everything was called out, as if you were shadowboxing. That way you get used to the combos a lot faster and they will come naturally to you when you spar and during a match. Training always helps when you envision your opponent in front of you; can't do that if you're staring on a screen, ya know?

What the makers of this app failed to do though, was accommodate southpaws, which is why it gets a single star.  Let me explain: When a southpaw does a ""1-2"", it is a right then a left. The app however, puts combos into the orthadox notation.  Basically, if you were practicing a 1-2, you would hear ""2-1"", which is orthadox for right left, but if you're like me, you end up doing a cross, then a jab. In the involved combos, it gets completely muddled up, because you have to sit back and actually translate the combo the app told you into something that makes sense, which is silly and wastes time. Counter-punching mode is again  geared entirely towards orthadox fighters, and is not affected by ""Southpaw mode"". If you're a southpaw, and want something to help you train, this is not the app for you. To the app developer: This was a pretty short-sighted error which I would not have expected from anyone into boxing at all. If you're going to make a southpaw mode, make it actually right. Also, southpaw mode should be more than just combos. It should extend into the counterpunch mode as well.",1,1,1.1,2013-09-11 20:10:33,Your comments and rating are absolutely ridiculous.
