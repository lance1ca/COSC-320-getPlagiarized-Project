I like that they keep updating the game. Not all updates good. Chance basedb update to search system is a bit too RNG. Water filter and dandelion tea etc are realistic and fair nerfing imo. Silly things eg that you can't get salt at the coast. If they change anything should be ability to choose if glue or tape is used. annoying amount of travelling (+ fuel). Map is dauntingly large. Illustrations and story are cool. Save games and easy mode would be nice.,4,1,1.679,2021-01-22 07:22:46,,

And to make it worse, dying not only gives you long debuff, it also removes noticeable part of your resources (not only what you were carrying, also items stockpiled in the cynically named ' safe houses'), and on top of that removes up to two levels worth of XP from you (if you were lvl31 with 90% XP towards leveling up to 32 the game will delevel you back to lvl30, making you lose HUGE ammount of progress) ... and in game with quite limited and finite looging possibilities where the only way to progress is to expend resources all these penalties combined easily snowball to put you into spiral of failure where you keep losing hard to replace resources and keep being deleveled even more (which seems to be the reason why save feature was removed ... implementing possibility of sliding into this death spiral of failure is probably very profitable) So now this game is poster child for everything wrong with mobile games industry. 1 star seems like a very generous score for the game in the current state.",1,137,1.641,2019-10-18 09:26:09,,

Give option to turn on & off specific items in pick up all like turn on heavy items to also pick up bricks and furnitures, or turn off unwanted items to not picking up normal clothes or other unwanted items. 4. Need more use of unwanted foods like rotten vegetables & contaminated food. like turn it into compost for faster or better quality of the greenhouse farming maybe? 5.

It was maybe the best post-apocalypse game on android, now it is just a shiny IAP trap.

Also they removed the premium starting set, no armor and weapons for you, no save/reload, the game automatically save on exit. That could be okay, kind of roguelikeish, but the game became frustrating and difficult. You need items to decrease your radiation level and that is limiting your scavenging ability. Wearable items (like armors, bags etc.) and vehicles brake down too fast, my bicycle broke down faster than i can scavenge for new parts. You need to reach level 30 for the first serviceable armor, until that anything can defeat you easily, except the most weakest enemies. But if you lost a fight, you lost a level (and items) so this - fight but don't die - can be a very frustrating experience, and you have to fight! But fear not brave survivor, the game shop is there for you to buy some remedies, THAT level 30 armor and experience multipliers! Btw, the shop has EA like loot boxes, so maybe you have to buy some to get the needed item. Really, i just skimming the surface of all the bad things in the game with this review.

I cant understand why same enemies have different chance of win like first radilactive rats easily killed by hands, but later on its getting harder. Maybe its better if its still constant. Another, at late game, skill building seems pretty harsh and make it little hard to completed, maybe there are ways to balance this.

Played it for like 2 hours straight and didn't even realize how much time had passed, so it was able to captivate me while I desperately looked for materials in order to survive. I also like the mystery theme while you try to figure out what in the world happened... To the world. Although given the radioactive state of everything, and the giant craters, it appears like you've (some how) survived a nuclear attack and are now in the middle of the fallout. While I look past that unrealistic outcome, unsure how much time has passed given that there already giant mutated rats hungry for radiation tingling flesh, I hope the story continues to intrigue and interest me. For those that would like a first or third person perspective... Yeah that'd be cool, however I can understand and appreciate the simplicity of the top down design. I feel like it does take away from the immersion, however, and I would personally like to see some customization for our character, and a visual representation of how we look, what gear we're wearing, even possibly our physical state. If we're sick, cold, or wounded, show it. If we're a decked out badass wielding a cross bow like Daryl Dixon, show that too. Simply put, the battle screen is boring. I feel no sense of danger at all. I've only battled a couple rats and the first rat I killed easily with a survival rate of like 30% using a flint axe, but when I fought the second rat with a cross bow with a survival rate of like 80% I got wounded and the rat ran away. Whaaat? I guess that was just random luck. I'm also uneasy about the cash shop. It appears very pay to win to me. I don't know if there is any pvp in the game, but if you wanted to, you could apparently easily survive in this world with just your wallet. Overall, I can like this game so far and I hope it continues to improve. I hope the developers really improve the immersion by incorporating character customization.",4,0,1.544,2018-11-27 17:12:24,"Hello! We are glad you like Day R.

We both started to get really into the game. I spent $30.00 and progressively got extremely far on the map. Then one day while my character was sitting in their safe house crafting, I continued to redundantly tap the craft button. Before I could notice I did not see my character's ""fatigue level"" rising and all of a sudden to my surprise my character died and then the game sent me back to restart with a clean slate. All the time I had spent on leveling, forging, and surviving over the past 6 months of my life and all the items that I have accumulated over the past 6 months are now permanently lost. Most of my items were purchased in the shop are now erased or non-retrievable. The only question that comes to my mind after all of this is why isn't there a save feature for the Mulitplayer Online Mode? After experiencing this grueling setback I don't think I can continue to play this game because it is not worth grinding another 6 months to try and recover everything I lost in one simple accidental death. This game also did not even reimburse my cash or items so that I could at least have the option to start again. I do not recommend this game for people who may feel the same way as I do. The developers should add a save mode in multiplayer.",1,9,1.607,2018-11-18 01:03:28,"Hello!

So I uninstalled it for a while and recently got back into mobile gaming and decided to go premium and I'm really glad I did. This game is definitely not for everyone. It's difficult and unforgiving and requires you to make hard choices. This is the exact kind of game that's perfect for mobile but would still work great on a PC. My only gripe is the IAP. I have no issues with paying money (hence paying 5 dollars that's basically just support since you only get like $2.50 worth of your 5 dollars). My issue is what the purchases get you. Everything is temporary. And in a game as challenging as this, you're going to be tempted to spend that dollar and another and another and ""just one more because I'm doing so well this run!"" To buy little things like water or food. You can get all this stuff in game, but the temptation is there because the option is there. Anyway that's my only real gripe with the game. When it first came out the translations were laughably bad, and now the games dialogue and descriptions are very well written. so they clearly put the work in In a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give this game a solid 9. It would get a ten if it either had no in app purchases or if you got more bang for your buck when you did spend money. Honestly. I wish I kept the free version and just spent 5 bucks in the shop. Would have gotten me further. So I say don't buy this. Get the free one and spend 5 in credits if you like it you're better off.",3,0,1.597,2018-09-23 14:42:49,,

I made a review on the premium version of the game a while back and I'm happy to say that the game has very much improved (to my tastes). However, I did find the leveling system unfavorable when it comes to crafting. When you level up, for example, mechanics you have a set goal of 5000, but your previous goal was 2500. After you make the goal of 2500, you automatically reset in points it takes to again. This is very annoying because now I have to spend more time than I'd like to. I just thought it was an inefficient way of leveling up. Other than that, I think combat as a whole is decent but I should not be losing fights with rats and they shouldn't be able to cause lacerations unless you're talking about rats the size of Bob cats. Also a minor nitpicky thing with the cars, they only last a few days of traveling not counting gas. That's kind of a turn off considering the game heavily relied on vehicles.

This game, to start, is amazing. Instead of going for cheap repetitive gameplay, Day R: Survival offers an open ended RPG experience, where each playthrough feels like a new adventure. There's all sorts of things to craft, discover, and, of course, shoot stuff with. From homemade pistols to T-90 tanks, this game has it all. The story is also wonderful, I think, as most mobile games barely even have one—at least, not one that makes you feel like you're hurrying across the nuclear fallout-ridden Soviet Union to save your family... if they're even alive. In the end, I'd recommend giving the free version a try, and if you enjoy that, then most DEFINITELY, get the full version. It's challenging, completely offline, and tons of fun for months.

complete the gameplay is, and how there is still continuous updates to 
improve and expand the game. The only gripe I have is with the controls, 
you find yourself having to zoom in and out continuously when traveling and 
searching. This is fine, but it seems that the two finger zoom control 
doesnt work when I'm holding the phone sideways and using my thumbs. 
Needing to change my grip to zoom can get frustrating when it's a 
constantly used function and changing grip can cause inadvertent inputs 
that can hurt you in game. This would also be fine if the zoom buttons were 
more precise, but at the moment they only cycle through 4-5 resolutions so 
you find yourself needing to zoom by hand anyways. I'm sure this will be 
fixed at some point, but it's something to be wary of if you're starting

Saving and almost expired animal carcasses don't interact well: if you saved with an almost expired corpse in inventory (ie 25% or less left) it will expire instantly if you load back to that save, this isn't unique to corpses either all fires can do this aswell. This might be by design dono but sometimes i noticed it turning new fresh meat into rotted meat along with it aswell. I notice it most with the mutant fish as it is too large to consume in one go unless you got a basement. Curently with the improved fishing rod i cant eat enough till i catch the next ""big one"" xD",5,0,1.560,2018-03-18 00:58:05,,

Now as for the loading screen, background wallpaper and first look into a new game for someone thats playing.. I think the main loading wallpaper should be based on the floor based game not a third person view cause at first it looked really interesting then you get in and its only movement based.. Now as for the difficulties I think they did a great job evening everything out based on how the exhaustion, posion, bleeding and health/food increases and decreases.. Now for a free game I Totally get the $4.99 for premium just kinda sucked without premium you couldnt play on multiple devices using the same profile even when you sent your profile to the cloud.. So heads up to thoses free to play players. Lets get into the gameplay and graphics.. First of all right off the start with the main quests to get started and the rat fights back to back.. I think its pretty addictive for thoses who really enjoy survival games.. But if your going for a higher difficulty you gotta pay attention to detail and what items youll need the most.. right at the start you'll wanna get a lot of water for radioation for food youll need to focus on searching house to house and town to town.. I start with the main quests tell the part when the characters daughter comes to him in a dream and tells you to go to the town on the bottom of the map.. so at that point I started travelling to towns and searching everything and tearing clothes I didn't need for treads and cloth and bandages.. Going south, but always made camps out in the woods where the lynx and wolves are for plenty of meet.. BUT dont leave the fat behind make sure to collect that because it does food and water not evenually of course.. youll have to reach level 3 cooking though to make the Smoked Fatback.. Helps when you arent near a save point and pretty far out with no towns.. Saved my life.. Now for Graphics lets say i havent quite changed it from the defualt settings yet just turned off the the music and sound thats it.. But i think for a floor based, movement function game its pretty good graphics for zooming in and out on the map to skout locations out. Just remember even playing sand box difficulty youll still have to pay close attenion to the top bar and how much you carry and where your at when it comes to not having enough supplies. Lets just say i think this games pretty addicting for a survivor game, there are some things I'd like the creators to add as for battles like when your out hunting or just traveling and something pops out I'd be nice to have more detail and info on the predator such as attack and the actual weapon derability when in battle to kinda know more then just to select aa weapon and hit attack and hope you dont get injured.. But anyways thats my rant for the day, if anyone has a question or thinks I'm wrong feel free to leave a reply.. Have a great Day everyone..",5,0,1.560,2018-03-11 13:41:17,,

I just love it! The Devs are updating frequently, the Premium currency doesn't affect the real playability (everything purchased from the shop is findable/craftable), and the community is very helpful (albeit a bit sarcastic at times ;). I'm excited to see where this game will end up when it comes out of Beta, as it's already pretty awesome!   Just as a minor negative: There should be some sort of in-game guide for newbs regarding online trading etc, as the neverending ""How do I do X"" can get a bit.. tiring. Also hoping for more end-game content, as personally it becomes a bit dull after finishing the ""Moving Town"". Perhaps a some sort of minor city-building goal? Starting your own survivor base such as the NPC ones. Just a thought.  Nevertheless: a great game! Thank you, Developers, for one of the best survival games out there!

One problem i had but i have no clue if it was just a glitch or just bad luck on my end. But i lost against a radioactive rat when i was equipped with highway clothes and a frag grenade with 95 percent win chance. So more than likely bad luck haha. But anyways amazing game is made. Its not for everyone though. Either you will love it or hate it. No in between. A masterpiece in the making. You should develop a similer game or just a dlc with the world ruled by robotic creatures.

If you really love the game spending only 5 dollars (one time) for premium is beyond worth it. I do wish that there was a place you could set up a house that wasn't just a camp site and fast travel to super big cities that you have already located because the map is HUGE.

The game starts out slow, as you make your way across Russia searching for supplies and trying to figure out what happened to the world. It picks up when you finally find survivor camps, where they give you quests. Resource management is tough, but its meant to be. Skill progression is good, as you learn new skills and can craft better items. Some items are too scarce (cement is really scarce, and made me a bit upset, since it's needed for most settlement builds).  Some developer recommendations: Need more variety of enemies. For the first part of the game, all you encounter are rats, wolves and lynx's. The fight system needs more interaction... All you do now is choose to fight or flee and it determines the outcome (boring, no control). It would also be great to allow users to customize the sandbox (users could choose if cities respawn goods over time, if gas stations always have gas and don't run out, and if certain items have unlimited uses like utensils). And, settlement traders should be able to buy/sell more items (a world wide economy would be awesome, where supply and demand affect prices).

Ok so I thought of quite a good way to resolve a cheating method; it is very used and it consists in saving a lot in difficult areas for example: there's a very difficult enemy Base you have to defeat and you only have  10% chance of beating it so what you do is save very near the Base and every time you fail load the saved file and try again until you succeed so to resolve this simply put a timer between saves, like 3 days (in game days) or 5 days depending on the difficulty and put a timer between loading saved files like 5 or 10 minutes (real life time). I really hope you implement this; it will also probably mean more money for you devs. Love the game but until you put back the old fighting sistem i'm only rating 3 stars. Finally I would love if you finished the retribution quest, add more main quests or put more story into Family matters and searching for truth.

I am quite impressed.  I can see some work that still needs to be done just to make it a better experience.  While I'm still working on figuring exactly what that would be I can say that it is a great game, with a huge map and crafting system.  There is a lot that the tutorial doesn't explain and it's not the easiest game to just pick up and master. But if you enjoy the fallout style games you will most likely really enjoy this game.  I haven't gotten very far into the main content but it seems to have a very detailed story and progression system and will definitely kill tons of time. I'm currently using on a Motorola X which by any means isn't a small screen, but I can tell the experience will be a lot better being played on a tablet.",3,4,1.545,2017-12-01 00:46:47,,

I wouldn't say it's graphically amazing but it a good look and the many menus are unintuitive and you will be flying thorough them in no time. The map is HUGE but once transportation becomes available you start zipping around. Rivers are not your friend.. It plays out somewhat like a table game. There are no animations even when fighting but it's done well. Your pretty much managing your inventory and health in this game. Move, search, collect, manage weight, eat/drink/sleep, manage health, build and fight. Repeat. Monaughtny sets in fairly quick then it drops a part or resource you need and the build/skill trees explode a bit then back to the grind. While grindy it's also damn addicting. You can play free which I did then I bought it. Supports the hard work. From there caps are the IAPs and seem very well priced. Well worth the ""door"" fee. The rest of the IAPs are setup to kill the grind time but you can play without them. I ended up buying gas as I stranded myself in the middle of nowehere on accident. Micromanagement is the core of this game but it's surprisingly satisfying. I'd like to see interactive fight mechanics and more npc interactions. Maybe I haven't gone far enough. Needs some diversity. All the settlements look the same overall. Wiki is a must. There are tons of features hidden throught the game. So it's worth tossing money at and the IAPs are priced fairly if you want to progress faster. I recommend playing the free version to test the waters and the paid version if you like the game. Few more hours in with a car to haul stuff around. Seems a bit light on missions and could really use NPCs and random mini missions. Maybe I just haven't run into people yet. A NPC dialogue tree would be very welcome. Old school portrait and text story would break up the search/build grind. LOVE THE GAME! It's a damn time machine.",4,5,1.514,2017-08-25 20:24:32,Hello!

It autosaves when I don't want it to.  The health status is across the screen at the top instead of stacked on the side.  The easy to see icons are now words.  I can't scroll through screens anymore. I can't sleep after eating. Instead I have to exit the menu first.  I have to go to submenus to see my equipped items and equipped items clutter the inventory.  The color status of sleeping changed for the worse and the recipe levels changed so I can't make things I've made before.  And you removed the feed saying experience and items gained? Why would you do that?  I just bought it when the update came out and was unpleasantly surprised.  I can't drop one item or see its info without hitting the little down arrow? I hope some of these things change because it takes more work to do the same things.,4,12,1.510,2017-07-31 07:12:13,,

Day R is a survival simulator in the nuclear post-apocalypse world. 
You can find equipment that increases protection from radiation and reduce the poisoning level with activated charcoal at the second level of chemistry.

Hackers run around gifting game breaking amount of resources everyday so play for free. Told my girlfriend to buy it so we can play together online. That night I was very upset over the hackers ruining the game for everyone. Moderators were scaremongering the kids and didn't know what to do. It was chaos, 50% was about hackers, 30% was about how to open said parcels, 10% was mods telling people they'd lose their game save and 10% was actually about playing. I said that in the game chat and mods even agreed with me and we're upset as well over dev not fixing the issue. I actually feel bad for them. Woke up the next day to jump on with my girlfriend and I think I am currently banned for bringing up the issue about hackers...Guess that's my fault. I currently cannot talk in chat but can still see the nonsense and I can't see/trade with anyone in the map making the game unbeatable. My girlfriend and I unable to play together as a result. There was no message explaining or if it is temporary so I  thought the game was broken for a while but it must be censorship. Told my girlfriend to try for a refund since she barely played. I guess dev doesn't ban hackers but the customers who actually paid money for the game and support them are punished.

You made all the vehicles guzzle fuel which is hard enough to maintain need to rethink that. Also maybe something to ponder, maybe add a way to make fuel through chemical tab might help offset some of the negative chagnes. Still enjoy the game but would like to see the development team show little more support to those of us who support them.   Update 4-20 So while the new update added some new goodies I noticed I get attacked almost 300% more then I did before sometimes I can't even heal one injury before I get totally screwed have to load a save. Gas harder to keep the vehicles still guzzle like heck finding things not quite as good either. Risks seem to have gone away used to find everywhere lately they like a unicorn super rare same for a lot of the meds.

It's just another pay to win case. I was really excited to finally have the chance to play it, but the game is very monotonous and extremely RNG based, cuz you need to spend so many caps to really progress to a steady pace. Even if you do buy the premium edition thus won't make much of a difference cuz you cannot select how much of everything you want to trade for. For instance, at one point I really needed some gas and I had to trade some caps for it.. But the trade had fixed amounts so I ended up leaving most of it cuz at that point I only had a motored bicycle. Besides, these trades are just totally stupid cuz irl you don't have a silly magical system changing tokens for gas or car parts... Please make this game interesting... Make it complete and leave the microtransaccions behind... They are running the gameplay and the survival experience... You can add a trader via quests or something to really add some extra things to your equipment... But this materializing things from nowhere via caps trade is just creatively lazy and greedy and  ruins the whole experience....",1,0,,2017-04-02 17:42:44,Hello! Thanks for your feedback!

It was the only game I've ever bought on play store, and I truly saw a blossoming game. However, this recent update has shown a disturbing trend of removing permanent benefits of premium membership, and making this game horribly expensive. You've removed the 20% discount, bumped up all the regular prices in the shop, and your prices in the shop are quite ridiculous. 150k caps for the mine truck? That's the equivalent of $75 USD for something that you never even see in real life. Also, you've moved the buttons around to where the shop button is now located conveniently at the explore button's location. If this game seems to get more and more greedy, I don't see much purpose in playing",1,15,1.453,2017-03-21 04:19:21,,

Edit: the latest version makes the explore window cover the whole screen so it's really tedious to search for stuff and move forward. Looking for cars is especially annoying as you can't see when they're nearby while moving. Edit2: combats are even more simple now with no tactics at all.
