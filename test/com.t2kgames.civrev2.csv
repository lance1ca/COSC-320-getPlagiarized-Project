I put this on my tablet for when I am not able to play on my console. It stinks. The problem with this version is that the AI cheats. It doesn't let you finish your turns after a save. Where normally you must ""end turn"" to signify you have ended your turn, if you have saved the game and load it later, after some reflection on strategy, it will automatically end your turn immediately without your consent. Thus, if you have things to do- troops to reinforce, production to change you are out of luck. I have lost a shocking number of cities this way. It is super irritatating. But this is even worse. Apparently, the AI doesn't have to abide by the same rules of the game as players. If one of the civilizations I""m playing against has a democracy, they glean the scientific and economic benefits of a democracy. However, in this version of the game, they do not have to accept the cost of a democracy, which is to cease war if offered peace. They simply refuse to engage in talks. As a player, you must pay this cost, so it makes your odds of winning where the rules are uneven based more on chaos theory than actual strategy. The two stars were for the expanded leaders and the expanded techs, which were nice but not critical to game play, unlike unfortunately, the flaws with this version. I played every civilization and won in every way on console but honestly don't think I'll pick up this poorly designed version of the game again.

I like it for the most part. I like how the different civilizations affect gameplay and that you have to play to their strengths. You can use terrain to win battles that you might have lost. There's naval battles, fights for air superiority and fighting over choke points and resources. Plus they leave options for using culture to beat a militarily stronger opponent. What I dislike is the lack of diplomacy. It's always ""give us this technology or die"" and then it a strength check. Also, it seems like there is a flaw in the combat system. I don't think I've ever heard of a fighter jet being shot down by a musket, but it happens alot here. Also, the units are usually represented in 3s but some of the stronger units only have 2, so sometimes the 3s beat the 2s or 1s just because it had 3 troops representing the unit. It leads to some frustration. Then there's a huge skill gap in the Warlord and King difficulty. It feels like you'll play regular and suddenly all enemies have Infantrymen attacking your Archers because they somehow managed to all discover gunpowder in 3 turns (exaggeration). All in all, I enjoy the game, just wish there was a little more depth to the diplomacy with other nations and the combat mechanics were tweaked.",4,0,1.4.4,2018-10-30 18:41:58,,

Random enemy units spawn by your cities and attack them in the same turn. (Normal in other Civ Rev games too)  Once you give an order to move a unit several spaces it can't be cancelled.

I've been playing the Civ series and its spinoffs for nearly 20 years. My gripe is with the inability to access the city screen - it just disappears, taking the ability to manage the build queue and your ability to wage war with it. Sometimes it comes back for a turn or two but then goes away again. Looking back in the reviews shows this glitch is several years old and the developer still hasn't fixed the issue despite releasing subsequent updates. This is disappointing on a few levels - this app costs money and it has Sid Meiers' name on it, both of which entitle a consumer to believe an app won't be so consumed with bugs that it precludes essential functions.",3,1,1.4.4,2017-12-20 13:30:36,,

Strategy is important - you can only win the game if you have a good one Unlockable world leaders - beat the game on king difficulty to meet the challenges and you unlock leaders with different attributes  Bad stuff -  Controls - frustrating to move units, especially when a city name gets in the way, or you select another unit when trying to move another. Also, you can't put a unit to 'sleep' - for example, build a nuclear missile and you have to tell it to wait every single turn, often more than once per turn   Winning - if you achieve a victory, the game won't let you keep playing beyond that. So you can't get an economic victory and then stay on and wipe out everyone. You also can't play beyond 2100, which is a shame   In all pretty decent, but some tweaks and TLC could make it 5*",4,1,1.4.4,2017-12-12 00:52:25,,

But this isn't the game I envisioned it would be. The core gameplay is intact with minor differences, but the AI is seriously impaired. That alone kills almost all enjoyment. Other problems include the controls which are very tedious to cycle through and bugs which prevent you from receiving rewards for reaching new tech first or milestones first.  But the biggest letdown is the AI.  In CivRev 1 the AI would attack barbarians and each other, in CivRev2 the AI civs don't attack barbarians and for some reason never ever come into contact with other civs.   This just results in every AI player just attacking you, no diplomacy between AI civs at all kills so much of your diplomatic options which defeats being a 4X game.  The game hasn't seen an update in a long time and I doubt any will come out soon, if you want 4X on android, this one barely scratches it.  I'd give this 2 and a half stars if i could, but since i can't, it'll be 3 stars.

I'm playing on a tab 4 and the game play is pretty solid. Sometimes it's a bit much to handle and it gets jumpy, but that's to be expected. I have two minor problems with this. Special forces? Their junk. Idk if your trying to make it more like the comp games where archers and such are used as offensive units? If that's the case here's your problem. Unlike civ5 these cities don't have standalone defenses. So 1. either leave both special forces and infantry as choices, or 2. raise special forces defense some. And the other issue I have is the troop movement. I like the idea of the bar at the bottom to shuffle through your troops but it gets absolutely annoying when your trying to unload a ship or troop transport and every time you get one unit off  it jumps to an idle unit all the way across the map. Actually now I have brought up an issue I had forgotten,  the ships. I think you should implement the ability to unload troops from ships like in civ rev 1. Make it a button opposite the defense button.",4,2,1.4.4,2015-05-21 10:41:28,,

Cities keep pumping out the same units until manually stopped. Troops cannot be sold, causing them to fill up your map if production is left unchecked. Technology tree is an abomination; it doesn't let you select an advance tech to work towards (or select a tech in the tree), nor does it show the relationships between techs at a glance. Tabbing out saves your turn, but makes you reload the entire game. Other countries constantly try to take money from you.

It's fun, it runs well on Shield, the games can be fairly long, it looks pretty, there is lots of variety (the full tech tree is there, and has similar effects).  Simple negatives (why not 5 stars): - No hotseat multiplayer - Winning ends the game instantly - The AI has a tendency to just... roll over and die. (your tanks vs their warriors) - The game asks permission to manage my Google calendars on boot. Never happening! - The game is complex, without much guidance! e.g. armies are made by stacking 3, civopedia is stowed in a menu, and you can micromanage city production.  Finally, let's compare to Civ 5. That it even bears comparing should say something. Civ 5 is like a pinnacle of strategy gaming - and this is a different range of hills, but also a high point (and certainly a pinnacle on native android). Civ revolution plays more like Civ 4 (e.g. stacking units). Everything is smaller (maps, cities, etc).   All in all: Very enjoyable!",4,1,1.4.4,2015-04-07 13:20:19,,

It has nice graphics and animations and it works well on my Nexus 5. There are a few flaws though (writing them down in case developers look at this review): - 'Allow Offline Access' is not sticky and appears every 10-20 minutes. There's an associated bug where the screen goes black and the game crashes occasionally when this happens. Luckily there are autosaves every round. - The game has an enormous battery drain, to the point where my phone discharges slowly even when the charging cable is plugged in. - For normal games (starting BC) I don't see the point in all those late technologies and city improvements -- the game is pretty much decided. - Trying to move a unit up one tile into a city doesn't work well, I always activate a different unit in the target tile instead. - Loading is too slow for my taste. Saving is quick. - If you are a bit ahead in technology the game becomes easy around renaissance time because you get lots of goodies for discovering things first. I find that a bit too generous. - Units have only a fortify but not a sleep mode. That can result in the enemy approaching without notice.",4,25,1.4.4,2015-01-12 06:33:59,,
