Thanks for letting me know about a problem with saving your videos. The usual way to save a video is to select the export button once the video has stopped recording. This will copy the video to a Luminancer album in the photo gallery. 

I will look into why this isn't working for you.
Thanks for the feedback!",2018-12-19 08:53:29

For the videos to show up in your gallery, all you have to do is move it from the Movies folder to DCIM and they will appear. EDIT TO ADD: Thank you for making this change in less than 10 minutes! it works perfectly!",5,13,1.0.11-rc,2018-12-19 19:06:34,,

However the videos are not being saved to the correct place which makes them unsharable. Instead of being saved to your gallery or photos like expected it's saving to MyFiles-> Internal storage -> Movies -> Luminancer. When you go to the video you can watch it on your phone but you can't share it to facebook or Instagram which is why I want this app. EDIT: Figured out how to share it but the videos still do not show up in my gallery which I would expect to see them there.,4,4,1.0.10-rc,2018-12-19 13:38:23,"Hello Zurka

Thanks for your excellent feedback. My intention is to have the videos save to a Luminancer album in the photo gallery. I'm looking into why you might be having this problem and I found that the videos take some time to appear in the gallery.  I've submitted a fix in 1.0.11 that improves this and possibly fixes this for you.

Thanks!",2018-12-19 15:24:23
