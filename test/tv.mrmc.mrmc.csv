Secondly, some of my ripped DVDs no longer play - the video stutters. I had to go back to my old Dune HD to play the videos which are only 2GB (not like I was trying huge BluRay rips).  That ancient Dune box can play the .mkv files, and MrMC *used* to be able to play them, but no longer.  Oh, and my phone can stream the .mkvs no problem using a different app.  So it is definitely the MrMC.  So let's review:  user interface since the update is horrible, and some files no longer play.

When passthrough was disabled it would play fine in stereo. As of the 3.8 update, the multichannel audio plays via optical passthrough quite well. Very pleased. Side notes: the FireTV 1 box played the same content over optical passthrough fine using 3.7.1.
