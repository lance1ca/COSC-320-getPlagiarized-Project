the pro version because it has more features. I also downloaded and use 
Whitenoise Market to download sounds others have recorded. The best part of 
this app is the ability to mix sounds. The screen has an icon at center 
screen representing the listener. You can then add up to 5 sounds. You can 
arrange the way the sounds move from left to right, right to left, whether 
to keep a sound on one side of the earphone, or just keep it centered. You 
can change volumes independently and a lot more. Obviously I highly 
recommend it!",5,2,7.3.1,2018-05-06 21:51:46,Thanks for the awesome review!  We are thrilled that you are enjoying all the awesome features White Noise Pro has to offer!  We appreciate your support and recommendation!,2018-05-08 12:41:42
