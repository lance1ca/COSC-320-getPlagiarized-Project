Unfortunately online games are currently not working. Using the friend menu to create a game - it seems like it's trying to create but then doesn't actually initiate a game. Online lobby games let you put in password and join but as soon as it tries to load it gives an error about internet connection.

Multiplayer is one of the biggest downfalls this game has. You are immediately replaced with an AI if you loose your connection. I was replaced while I was answering a text and the game was running in the background. This is frustrating to say the least. There is also a bug where the game goes completely black if the phone screen was locked during play. You have to force quit the game and start over. All games except campaign are lost including Multiplayer.,3,1,1.3.10,2021-02-05 17:55:13,,

The game is competitive but it is not stressful which I really appreciate. It is not a game centered around disrupting or sabotaging others.
