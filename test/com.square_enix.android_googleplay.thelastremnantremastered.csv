I'm actually impressed how well this runs on the Galaxy Note+. I played this on the Xbox and now it's available on the phone and they kept the speed feature (which fixed the slowness of long battles). The is an excellent jrpg that runs well on the phone. In my opinion it's worth the price of admission.,5,73,1.0.0,2019-12-12 11:37:55,,
