Please add more adjustment options which helps utilize usage of processing on high end mobile devices for a richer experience, as on PC steam, game is doing much smoother, where I can even play the game in 144Hz. Other than that, character controls are simulated like gamepad control, a bit uncomfortable. UI looked a bit small from my view, probably due to resolution",3,8,1.0.2f,2020-12-17 20:43:57,,
