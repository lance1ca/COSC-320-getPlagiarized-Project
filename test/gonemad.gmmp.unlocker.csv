The one thing I didn't find very easy to figure out was how to make the app find the music I had copied over onto the phone. If you go into the albums or artists page and then go into the menu and there's a ""Refresh"" option. Intuitively, one would think that's what you need to press in order for it to find the new music you've added to your library. Well, it ain't. After a lot of frustration and almost getting to the point where I was going to ask for my money back I happened to drop out of the Artists or Albums screen back to the home screen and then out of desperation went into the preferences menu. There I saw a ""Scanner"" option. Thinking that would only show me preferences for the scanner but having tried pretty much everything else that I thought was obvious, I went into the Scanner preferences. Well, lo and behold there's where the developer hid the ""Start Scan"" button. Touch that and the app can now find your new music. How much more of an non-intuitive place could you come up with to hide that function? Fix that issue and I would give 5 stars.",4,4,1.1,2012-03-08 21:28:06,,

I know that poweramp also has scrobbling, gapless playback, high definition volume steps, and an equalizer, but what sets GoneMad apart, for me, is how it hands playlists.  'Clicking' a song enques it to my current playlist if I already have a song playing.  I can long press the song if I want to play it immediately or as the next song.  And playlists can also be arranged by dragging and dropping.  These options are all customizable, so if you want to handle your browsing and playlists differently, you can do that.  The player is being updated constantly by a developer who seems very responsive and active. He added one feature (ignoring ""The"" for artist sorting), and fixed one bug at my request (ignoring capitalization for folder sorting).  New skins should be coming out soon for the already nice looking interface.  TL;DR - Best customizable feature rich player on the market with a very active dev, look no further than GoneMad",5,2,1.0,2011-12-28 11:37:04,,
