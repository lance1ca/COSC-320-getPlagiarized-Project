Even the basic aren't solid colors except white. Wish the was a purple selection.,3,2,2.1.9,2020-09-08 01:12:51,"cjgodiva1977, thanks for suggesting the solid colors. I had something similar on my backlog and moved it up to fill your request. It's a feature where you can tint the color of the dice. If you move the sliders in the new tint setting you can get purple dice of any shade! This will be out on the 2.1.10 release. Thanks for the request!",2020-09-12 09:43:05

The sounds go off the roll before they are supposed to. So for example say you roll a 14 you might hear the critical fail that's supposed to go off for when you get the 1 for your next roll. Thanks for the fast fix,5,1,2.1.8,2020-05-15 13:27:27,"Thanks for checking it out James! I had not seen that bug, thanks for reporting it. I will try to replicate it and get a fix out asap.

I never want to add ads to any app that I make, so to offset upkeep costs I just make it as cheap as I can and not lose money. I am glad my decision is noticed.
As for the success threshold, that is a great idea. I will add it to my backlog and work on that soon. Hopefully I will have that out in the week.",2020-04-28 08:26:46

For removing properties, you can long-press on the property button to reset them. I will look into making that more obvious/easier to do. Thanks!",2020-02-01 13:37:33
