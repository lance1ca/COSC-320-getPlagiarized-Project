I have to relaunch the game everytime it happens and it stops responding less then a couple minutes after opening. Pretty disappinted about it because i didnt want to buy it initially but my nephew likes playing the games a lot. Hope it can be fixed.",3,37,1.5.6,2016-12-04 20:01:48,"Our apologies about this malfunction, Elora.
