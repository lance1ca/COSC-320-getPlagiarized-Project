Thank you so much THUP games - VERY impressed by how seriously you took my complaint :)  I will be buying all the THUP monkey games as my 2 year old adores them so far.  Thank you very much!!    Original post:  My Daughter loves the Monkey apps - we started with Monkey Preschool lunchbox which she plays at childcare (she is not yet 3) so I got her this one for a bit of a change.  However, after any race, it says to hit the arrow to continue but there is never an arrow!  I have to exit the game and restart each and every time.  Please fix and I'll update my rating :)",5,21,1.09,2014-08-28 03:15:45,"Sorry for the trouble!  Can you let me know what kind of Android device you are using?
