Now the alarm sound continues even while typing on the keyboard which means that with an alarm with a few hard problems to answer to snooze/dismiss, it could take a long time for the alarm to be silenced and this is a huge problem.

Uninstalled, going to try and reinstall just to see if it'll work....  I had been using Alarm Clock Extreme, even paid the $4.99 for the no ad version, but this one has all the same features and more!  My favorite option is using it as a bedside table clock.

It's been the way I wake up almost every day. Thanks for all the excelent features! Two requests, however:     1. In my sleepy stupor I have occasionally hit Dismiss when I meant to hit Snooze.  It would help to have an option for ""Double-tap to Dismiss.""  (I would also suggest having the non-rotating mode as the default. Using it was much easier once I found that option.)     2. I use the countdown timer function frequently, but find it rather awkward.  It always opens centered around 40 minutes, yet I almost never select something in the visible range. I usually want between 8 and 20 minutes. It would be great to have it open centered around your last choice.

Well, this one has a clean design; throws in enough features to make it stand out, and not so much that it's a nuisance to use. I'm currently using the Nexus S, which has a curved body. This physical design prevents the front of the phone, the glass, from touching a surface when placed face down. I mention this because my favorite feature is the flashing screen for an alarm. On the Nexus S, face down, with the screen raised ever so slightly above my desk, this creates a subtle effect when you don't want to disturb others.

I use at least four alarms a day. Yesterday I upgraded and backed up & restored my alarms to the no-ad version. Then my next alarm didn't go off! It was set, both the lock screen and ACP showed it, but it didn't alarm. It was set for 3:30 am Saturday and at 5:00 Saturday it still said the next alarm would be 3:30 Saturday (when it should have said 3:30 Sunday). I restarted the phone and I think it's working now, but I'm definitely nervous.  Moral of the story: be sure to reboot after upgrading.  Also, to the developer: I love the ""skip next alarm"" feature, how about adding a ""skip x alarms"" feature? I have an alarm set for my kids to go to the bus and use ""skip next"" when they have a day off of school. I'd love to be able to skip a set number for when they have several days off, i.e. spring break.",4,0,4.9,2012-03-24 02:17:17,,

I would prefer to dump the extra news items and get rid of The Weather Channel because The Weather Channel seems to pick and choose which ever location it desires in my area (random locations not anywhere near me and where I live, temps can vary greatly with just a few miles).
