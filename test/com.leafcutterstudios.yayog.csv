About a year ago I started working out in earnest and I started with some generic app to help me. Over the next 6 months or so I used several different apps that I enjoyed and was able to lose 30 pounds. I hit a rough spot and didnt work out for a few months and to get myself back into it I decided to start the you are your own gym program. Now I'm in week 9 of the program and it's been pretty different from the other apps I've used. For one I haven't lost a single pound, but I believe I'm losing inches and I can tell that I'm stronger. I feel better and have more energy which was my original goal anyways. What I like about the guided program is that I feel like it stretches you but it also feels possible to do. I also like the variety of it because I find I get bored when I do the same workout week after week. Hands down though I would recommend this to anyone.

It handles a variety ways to structure the workout and you can select a variety of exercises, substituting for cases where you can't do a particular exercise that day due to fatigue or injury. Where it falls apart is attempting any sort of custom workout. There's no option to hold an exercise for more than 9 seconds despite several stating that you should be holding it for longer periods of time. The repetition parameter is ignored. Workouts that require you to repeat the same set of exercises as a circuit repeatedly only run one circuit and then tell you your workout is complete. I have seen reviews stating that this was a relatively recent thing, broken by an update.  Outside of that, the app is prone to freezing, particularly between exercises, and will sometimes start up an exercise 15-20 seconds in, acting as you started before they told you to start.  The developers need to spend a bit of time fixing their product to actually work again.

Also, during exercises video plays just one, doesnt loop like when you play it in description. That bothers me when the exercise is new for me.

For anyone who's read the book and uses the exercises and programs this app is like having a personal trainer with you pushing you harder. It automatically steps you through whichever of the predefined programs from the book that you're working on.  All exercises are documented with at least 3 pictures per exercise, and you can also download an additional (ca 500mb) add on that adds video demos of each exercise for free. This is truly unbelievable value for money.  Mark's book ""you are your own gym"" is an excellent book, this takes it to another level.  I've rated this app 4 stars because I've found two bugs that need to be fixed:  1. When I try to change an exercise in one of the daily routines of a program, no matter which exercise I try to replace it always replaces the first exercise in the routine.  2. When using the quick workout option, the next exercise starts before the rest period has finished.   At the moment I'm working through the programs from the book so these bugs don't affect me. If you can fix these I'll give it five stars for sure, but I'll probably drop it to 3 when the bugs get in my way.  My Phone: Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300, Android 4.1.2",4,0,1.60,2013-07-16 22:58:50,,

I'm three weeks into the program, so it's not like I know exactly what trajectory I'm on, though, feeling healthily sore all the time is an awesome signal.  But I can say with confidence that this is an extremely well crafted workout application.  Throw your phone in an armband, plug in some headphones so you can hear the trainer instructions, and jump into your workout clothes, and you're good to go.  I was already impressed with this app the past three weeks.  But the new redesigned UI just blows me away.  Integrated videos. Vastly better workout descriptions.
