So I downloaded the app.  It turns out this is one of the most surprisingly detailed board game adaptations out there. The train, originally a cardboard model, has become a 3D train chugging at high speed across the Western landscape. The player pawns become colorful, partially animated drawings straight out of the instruction book's illustrations. They look like cutouts come to life, even though the original game uses wooden pawns.  And then there's the music! It captures the Spaghetti Western feel perfectly, with hummable tunes and a theme for each character. They practically scream “make my day.” Try listening with some good headphones sometime! There's a lot of musical detail that will go to waste if you don't.  As for the board game itself, this is an excellent tabletop title that I definitely want to own, and will be reserving a spot on my shelf for it. It takes programmable movement, secret actions, unique character powers, and a clever theme, turning them into something fun and unique.  Despite my high rating, there's still some room for improvement. Here's what needs attention:  1. This game is rated Everyone 10+, but the bonus comics — which are easily earned and accessed — contain some strictly adult subject material and even an early instance of the F word. Really, this deserves a teen rating, minimum, with the comics included.  2. The AI doesn't understand the rules variants very well... or in one case, at all. AI opponents never seem to brave the Flames, they don't know how to “give” the Cursed Amulet, and they are completely befuddled by the Flat-Bed Car, to the point where the Flat-Bed Car variant kills all semblance of a challenge when used in one-player games.  3. Online mode is so unintuitive that I've yet to manage to complete an online game at all. Players don't join and rarely invite, and the chat room is dead most of the time. Quick Play never seems to live up to its name. Something needs to be changed to entice players into actually participating.  4. What really irks me about the game is that even though it intentionally tries to include a wide variety of races — white, black, Hispanic, and Native American — the charter designer / comic artist obviously put no research at all into the Native American character “Cheyenne.” Heck, her name is the name of a TRIBE, not meant for an individual person. Her brothers in the comic are dumb and lazy, while Cheyenne lectures them on respecting the law (i.e., white European law).  Even her music sounds like a “mystic savage” racist stereotype.  Come on, guys. You've got a great game: bring it into the 21st century. All you need to do is abandon the pre-1960s stereotypes and look up some history online rather than making stuff up.",5,4,1.2.0,2017-02-07 21:31:59,,
