But, I was looking for a good strategy game that wasn't limited by 10 or 20 levels; something I could play a lot and often, that would take a bit to master, and wasn't thumb-reaction based. WotZ seemed to fit the bill. Usually, I play turn-based RPGs on my tablet and ARPGs on my PC. I also now own a couple JRPGs (tablet), but could never find a good RTS that I liked. I always return to Baldur's Gate type games (KotOR, Shadowrun, etc.) but need a break from those every so often. I am also a big fan of having to use my brain. If you are anything like me, don't pass on WotZ! It is unique and almost exactly what I was looking for (I say ""almost"" only because I haven't come close to mastering it yet; half the challenge for me is mastering the game). I highly recommend the game and, as a bonus, no IAP and it is continuously developed. For revenue purposes though, I recommend a donate button be added somewhere inconspicuous. -1 star for no proper WEB site, only a Facebook page that is totally useless for people who don't have an account (and don't want one).",4,29,1.2.93,2016-12-16 18:45:17,,

I had zombie speed at Medium but once I discovered dogs I turned it down to Slow as one of my guys had the katana and the dogs could hit him before he could swing even on a one on one with no distractions so for me the dogs were too fast. Also, I would REALLY like some feedback when your guys take damage (from zombies not rebels) - an audio effect would be helpful because I just had a top guy die using the katana when he seemed totally fine. I was watching him the whole time - hacking up zombies and then suddenly he just died. There was no indication on screen (other than his health which I wasn't looking at) that he was getting hit - no zombie animation, no sound, no soldier reaction... nothing. I had no idea until he just died suddenly and his health had been fine when I checked it 10 seconds prior. So an audio effect for damage would be a big help as well as maybe a critically low health warning or something. And a way to eventually win the game would be good!
