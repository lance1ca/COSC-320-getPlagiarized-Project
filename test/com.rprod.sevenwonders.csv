There is/was a bug at one point with deciding the science symbol for a wild science card or spy. The leader that gives 3 additional points per set was not factored in and the app would incorrectly choose maximizing a particular symbol over getting the next set.  There was a sporadic bug that doubled the military value of a card when played, but that seems to have been resolved.  The interface for choosing a trade scenario to build a card can be limiting especially considering the leader that gets you a coin from the bank per neighbor. The app may give you the option to trade for two resources from your left or two from your right but not the option of one to the left and one to the right, which would get you an additional coin from the bank.

And the tutorial explains really well the game for beginners. There are however some small things that should be improved. First, when playing a multiplayer game, if the host switches app (e.g. receiving a call or replying to a message in another app), the connection is lost for every players and we have to restart a new game. Multitasking should be well supported, for host and clients. Second, during a game, it is hard to swipe down to see the compact overview of an opponent's city. We have to put our finger to a precise point to swipe down (open the overview) and swipe up (close the overview). It's not intuitive. Swiping up demands to put our finger at the extreme bottom of the overview, and sometimes we accidentely grab a card by doing it. Third, the timer should be customizable by the host (on/off and duration). Fourth, games history with stats could be nice :-) But despite these small demands, the game is great and fun to play!
