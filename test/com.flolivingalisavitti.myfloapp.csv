you that your period should come. The other miss , the most annoying one , 
is that in the same fix it tells me that my estrogen is too high and too 
low : so I need both increase it and decrease it at the same time :( Also 
it does not list my symptoms of the day when I try to track them ( I guess 
because it is not relevant at the particular phase? ) and does not let me 
save data unless I tick ""no symptoms."" At least call it ""no relevant 
symptoms "" if headache or bloating not relevant in particular phases. It 
also constantly pushes to buy additional products that are very expensive 
(250 to 400 dollars). I wander how is my free app can send me analysis of 
my period and all other good reminders without pushing any in app 
purchasing. And my app I can get free for both Itune , desctop and android

The premise of this app was to help you track your symptoms and period, to then actually get back to a normal 28 day cycle. The app doesn't deliver on this at all.  The symptoms that it asks for are too simplistic (and heavily geared towards the developer's overpriced programmes).  If you buy this app to try and get your cycle under control and find out where you are in your cycle, DO NOT BUY IT. When I started I had no idea when I would get my period (maybe once ever 6 weeks). Since then my periods have normalised, but the algorithm in the app has zero learning capability which means now I still am none the wiser when I am supposed to be getting my period, because the app still insists on having my cycle go for 6 weeks.

Now it just crashes or throws a 'Not reaponding' message every time, rendering it completely useless. I've kept logging against WomanLog (the free app) all along so will just go back to that. Not great really considering My Flo is a paid app. Also, as others have said, it links your symptoms to different times in the cycle, so you can't have nausea at one point, it's as though the app thinks that's impossible (I wish!).
