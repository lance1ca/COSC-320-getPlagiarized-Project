You still need to have a solid swing, but so far it's helping me hit it longer and straighter. And it is fun to use and play around with different swing speeds.",5,5,1.5.2.0,2019-10-04 15:26:21,,

A quicker well timed back swing put a lot of pop back into my driver. Also all those swing thoughts have quieted down and now there is just a tone to listen for. So far this app has had alot of positive effects on my swing .,5,6,1.5.2.0,2019-05-03 17:06:44,Thank you for taking the time to write a comment.

After purchasing ""Mobile Golf Tempo"", I really realized how true that is!  At first, I thought I would never swing that fast. I persevered, and now I have a more flowing golf swing, the ball goes straight and far. What impressed me the most was the tempo of the putting swing. I discovered that my downswing was really too slow. I now have a consistent tempo in the putting stroke that provides me a better distance control. I really recommend this app to golfers that want to improve their golf games.",5,3,1.0.5.0,2013-10-23 05:40:29,,
