The focus here is definitely on the combat with story taking a backseat to the fighting. The characters offer a good mix of skills and specializations although I definitely felt certain builds worked better than others (tanks are kings in this system). There are some minor bugs and glitches and the level up system is quirky but I'd definitely be back for another go from Wavelight.,5,0,4,2021-01-10 15:33:51,,

If u like rpg strategy game with random item loots and difficulty selection. No iap and offline then this is for u. U can play anytime u want. Item drops maybe little but there are tons of random items u can equip on 6 party members. No Items will be the same all the time. Only thing using smartphone to play will be the small fonts.
