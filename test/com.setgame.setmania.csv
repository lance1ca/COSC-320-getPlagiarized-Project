I love that it tells you if the set was right. The hint option is super useful for times when we can't find a set. I wish it had an option to automatically track the score for multiple players to make it like the original ""family game"". When we played, I kept score on a piece of paper which meant I was slower to find sets because I had to look away from the screen each time to track scores.",4,1,1.0,2021-01-02 06:57:13,,

His response was polite and very helpful, so I changed my review from 1 to 4 stars. When I tried to play this game (classic mode, by myself), there was some kind of timer/ticker going at the bottom of the screen. It kept going the whole time I was playing, and it was so distracting that I stopped before the game was over. I couldn't find a way to turn that off, so I sent an email to the developer. They didn't respond, so I requested a refund. Google Play declined my request. Now I am stuck with a game that I don't even want to play because that timer (which has no relevance to the game) won't stop. Most games I have that have timers include an option to turn them off.",4,54,1.0,2019-03-24 19:07:39,,
