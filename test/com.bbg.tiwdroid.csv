Mainly, things disappearing from inventory. Had to start anew from the very start on those occasions. And once finished, the achievements were inaccurate. I was never able to claim the 'Complete Chapter 3' achievement even after finishing the game twice. Nor the one for speaking to all available Asposians (even when I played a third time just to tap on all the dialogue bubbles). Other than those irritating glitches/bugs, the game was interesting and mostly fun. (But starting over again and again was frustrating.)",3,0,,2018-11-24 19:29:15,,

I couldnt wait to get to the end to find out what happens. I had zero bugs or glitches as others have reported. Problem solving in the first couple of levels was fun but I found subsequent levels incredibly frustrating because many problems are completely illogical. There wasn't any reasonable or intuitive way to solve the puzzles, it becomes mindless trial and error. The solution to some problems are so unintuitive that I felt I was wasting my time trying to think them through and I fully relied on the hints for more than half of the game. I also found it frustrating to backtrack between scenes. Rather than having a progressive flow through rooms or scenes, you have to backtrack to pick something up - not because you missed it but because something random such as a conversation triggers eg. A wall to crumble which creates dust you need to return to retrieve. For those interested, this game does not pass the bechedel test. I found this mildly annoying, but noticable enough to add to my review. + The character Laura is cool but ""bitchy"".. hmmm. I rated 3/5 for plot interest and novelty but it is frankly quite frustrating to play because it is so illogical.

The dots indicating the clickable areas only appeared if I dragged a tool icon onto the screen, which was cumbersome.  There should be a switch of some sort that will toggle the clickable areas on and off.   These problems render the game almost unplayable.  This is a shame because it's such a wonderfully written game.  That being said, I wouldn't pay for another game from this studio",3,1,1.6,2014-12-20 16:01:55,,

In all, it took nearly four hours for me to complete this game, which I'm not entirely sure was worth the price, but I enjoyed the structure and gameplay.  I didn't love the way the principal character was drawn; it looks creepy. And his voice is even creepier. In fact, so many of the other parts are so poorly voice-acted that I found it a great improvement to turn off the voice and just read the subtitles. Dialogues are frequently too drawn-out and puns tend to fall a little flat (but that might be in part due to translation issues).  That aside, the game also crashes far too often. This is not too bad because it auto-saves after (almost) every significant progression.  I bought this game hoping to find something like Discworld or Monkey Island. It falls short of that lofty goal, and unlike those games I don't think I will go back and play this one again, but it has done all right in keeping me amused for a day.",3,1,1.6,2014-10-28 19:33:13,,
