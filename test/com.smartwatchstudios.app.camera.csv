I purchased it to be able to record video so I can setup my phone on a raised tripod and have the ability to start/stop the video while also keeping an eye on what is recording without needing to reach the phone itself. I haven't used it for photos so I can't comment much on that other than to say that the couple of test photos I took seemed to be fine. There are two important features that are missing that prevent a 5 star review. First, I was really wanting the ability to pause video recording and re-start instead of having to stop and re-start a new video thus creating a new file. I am filming sporting events with lots of dead time and this is a critical feature. Second, I couldn't find anywhere to change the storage location of the videos so they can be stored on my phone's SD card instead of its internal storage. Other than that, the app seems to do what it claims and I haven't had any issues with connectivity.",4,4,5.2.3,2021-01-06 09:49:01,,
