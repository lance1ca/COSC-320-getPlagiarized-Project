The website is great for manipulating the cards and organizing them, if I don't have access to my laptop with the CardScan software on it.   I would like to see both Android app and desktop app updated to reference newer email clients so I don't have to do the ""tricks"" to transfer the info. The camera use on the phone is not fabulous, so I will often only scan a card with the phone if it is urgent. I have another temporary option available on my phone, if needed (take pic and clip into Evernote). It doesn't have a lot of sensitivity with the camera, is very difficult to focus right to get the card ""flat"".

If your handset also has these symptoms, you'll understand why I wrote here that it ah... sucks!  But within minutes the ScanBizCard team reacted to my negative post here and to tech support first by email, then with a call!   They directed me to ""Please touch Settings on the main page, then uncheck Use Device Camera (or vice-versa).""  I also rebooted the phone, and though it'll need more testing, it all seems to be working fine now!

Extremely easy to snap a picture of the card and scan it. I love the fact they added the ability to take a picture of both the front and back of the card. You can scan it or sign up for websync and work from your computer. Best part is the ability to export to vcards into outlook. Great app...well worth the few bucks!,5,2,1.0.44,2012-03-27 18:16:57,,

Built in LinkedIn request capability makes it even sweeter. Support is fast, friendly and personal (and only occasionally needed). I rarely buy apps, but it's worth it to get the Premium version of this one because it's simply loaded with features and options. I use it especially when I meet a lot of people at conferences and need to follow up efficiently with them - take a photo of the card (and the backside if I want), 30 second check to see the app has scanned the card info correctly, save it to my Google and Outlook accounts and send a LinkedIn request if appropriate. Eliminates the need for secretarial assistance with my cards. Eliminates the need to carry them with me, since I can access the original image through the app.  Simply brilliant.",5,3,1.0.43,2012-02-19 09:37:24,,
