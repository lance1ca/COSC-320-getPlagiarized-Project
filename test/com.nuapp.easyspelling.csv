What makes you foolish enough to believe that everyone wants to announce to the world around me. That I cannot spell every second word on a bad day?? I am deleting this app and getting a refund... Now cya,1,6,2.1.5,2019-10-23 17:33:46,"Hi Noel, we are sorry you felt uncomfortable using the app. The app is designed to aid with spelling through voice recognition only.

Tapping on this icon allows you to change the Media Volume. Disable silent mode. Press ""Power"" button and hold it until a menu appears on the screen. Clear the ""Silent Mode"" check box in the menu to disable the Silent Mode option. Thank you",2018-03-13 19:38:10

The app is extremely easy to use and it has worked wonders in that my students are able to express their thoughts into writing with confidence. The handwriting option prompts them to write neatly as they transfer their ideas into their writing books. I highly recommend that the app is also made available offline.",5,9,2.1.2,2017-05-06 05:40:39,Thank you very much Ann for your review and 5 star rating and sharing with us how the app is helping your students in the classroom and with their writing confidence.

She is at the age where she needs lots of help with homework, spellings, story writing etc. As she kept asking me "" how do you spell.....?"" I was struggling to help her as my spelling is not great. This app has changed both our lives, so now she just press's the mic and off she goes, she isn't very confident and uses a shy voice and  still this fab app gets it right every time. I have recommended it to school who will be using it too. If I had just one grumble it is that it's a shame there's no lines on the screen when using the coloured screen, I would have thought this essential for a learning child. But I would still give it 5 stars x",5,12,1.9.6,2016-02-11 02:34:43,"Hi Andy - your feedback, review and recommendation is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for sharing this with us.
