This app only works in portrait, looks cheesy, has a much less capable search, and has fewer knots. After some digging, I realized the older app is Knots 3D. Well worth the extra cost.",2,8,1.8,2020-04-12 04:40:05,"Thank you for your feedback. Talking about rip-offs at a price of € 1.99 for 130 knots can only result in € 1.99 being too high a price for you.  Since your financial situation is so bad, I would reimburse you for the price.  The landscape mode for tablets is currently being worked on and wide nodes are also following.  greetings",2020-04-12 05:53:15
