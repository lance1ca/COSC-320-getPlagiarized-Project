This one paces the learning very well for a beginner and has good repetition to learn reading notes well. I wish there was a way to have an extended keyboard (two octaves) and to take the letters off the piano keys so that my kid learns to remeber the location of the piano key instead of looking for the note itself.,5,12,1.3.64,2020-11-20 13:57:59,"Thank you.

Great app, thanks!  :)",4,7,1.2.0,2018-01-09 13:31:27,"Thanks for your comment :)
The ""no mistake"" rule is based on learning process in french music schools and was approved by the music teachers I worked with ;) For young children, you can use the +75% extra-time. Example : for an initial timer at 1min, it adds 45s, for 2 min, it adds 1m30s and so on...",2018-01-13 00:21:49

Just a bunch of icons and arrows and you're supposed to guess what it all means. Horrible! An app is only as good as its internal support. As the reply indicates, the developer is so lazy that he cannot put an inside help with instructions that explains things. A demo video is no instructions. Terrible. I can't believe I paid for this.",1,3,1.1.9,2017-12-23 23:46:19,"Hi. I'm sorry the app does not suit you. Watching the demo video shows you how icons, arrows and the whole app works ;)

My new years resolution was and continues to be learning how to play the piano. Talk about teaching an old dog new tricks. Specially when an old dog such as myslef has never played an instrument, nor had any idea what those funny little things on the staff were. After spending countless hours searching online for an actual computer software and apps that make false promises, I came accross Jungle Music. Jungle Music is entertaining and gratifying thus prompting me to share this GATEWAY! to learning the music theory. Initially, this was only my new years resolution but has turned out to now being my entire families new years resolution. Jungle Music's unique attention to details makes this app fun for anyone at any level or age. My wife, both my four and five year old sons are also captivated and we can all enjoy it through the multiplayer option. Allowing me to track everyone's progress which then pushes me to learn more to be able to teach them. I am always looking forward to logging in to start my session finding it hard to stop. I strongly recommend Jungle Music to anyone whether you're a beginner or a more advanced person as you will affectively achieve the desired results while being exhilarated by the different levels and the growth of your character.",5,11,1.1.5,2017-02-26 02:22:22,"Woah !
