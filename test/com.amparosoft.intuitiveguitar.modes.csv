This app is setup from the start to really help anyone that wants to be 
smart with the guitar or bass fretboard. Breaking down into smaller 3 
string chunks totally helps learning gains. It also give a sense of 
accomplishment that is not usually felt when dealing with such a large area 
of theory. Kudos for helping musicians everywhere. Great app.",5,8,1.6,2018-07-14 18:52:48,"Thank you!, we're glad you understand how this app intends to help you so well",2018-07-16 07:03:53
