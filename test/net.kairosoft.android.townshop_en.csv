I feel like more people should buy games like this rather than ones you have to pay for to win. Kariosoft is the only ones that make it feel like a real game and not a cash grab. But since roller coaster tycoon came out they are one of two companies with real tycoon games and I love them both. But kariosofts variety of games make the best tycoon games on the appstore to me personally. Thank you kariosoft for translating and I look forward to playing more.
