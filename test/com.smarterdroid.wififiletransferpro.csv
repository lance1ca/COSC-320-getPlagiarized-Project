The bad part? It is *dog* *slow*. I have 5 GHz wifi and gigabit internet where I live. Speedtest on my phone shows me pulling down and uploading around 200 Mb/s. OTOH, as I type, in another tab on this browser I see my phone downloading files using WiFi File Transfer Pro. It nicely shows an indication of how fast the data is moving. How fast? All of 0.02 MB/s. That would be something like 0..2 Mb/s, a whole 1/1000th the speed that Speedtest shows my phone is capable of. It's been going a couple of hours, and made it a whole 5% of the way through the transfer of 7GB, rather than being over and done with in a few minutes. I do note that when uploading, the app creates a .zip file and sends that rather than pulling down one file at a time as it's doing now, which may very well be a major source of overhead. Which reminds me--there's no button to push on the web page via which one transfer files to let me break out of this mind-numbingly slow file transfer.",4,0,1.0.9,2021-02-09 18:34:55,,

Additionally: ""but it's slower than a wired connection with usb-C"" This is simply incorrect, with WiFi 5 or WiFi 6 (AC or AX respectively) get 100+MBps, the speed you get out depends on your WiFi connection, a few reviews say they get slow speed, this app is not the bottle neck. this app can access SD cards with no problems as well. This is a fantastic app that is quick to set up and is universal, but due to not understand the issue, negative reviews have been posted. Another app won't fix a slow WiFi connection.

For transferring videos, this speed is incredibly important, and so I will likely not be using this app as a regular method of transferring files. On top of that, the GUI seems old and outdated. It also doesn't do a very good job of mimicking the directory structure of the phone and memory card. The emulated filestructure is very confusing and seems to be missing folders. I was able to pull files from the memory (SD) card, but there was nothing intuitive about how to find the files. I'm still not even certain that I would be able to find all the different files and folders as they exist on the memory card. I think perhaps this app may only recognize and display known media files (don't quote me on that though). Transferring multiple files at once is also clunky as you have to save the files individually, and with Chrome, it seems you can only download 5 at a time, and so you have to wait until the first one of those five completes before more ""Save As.."" dialog boxes pop up for the 6th file, then wait some, then ""Save As..."" another, etc...

Boxcryptor makes PC-android phone seamless but it isn't intended to completely hide private folders/files... takes an extra step to do that. Folder Lock app for Android is kinda weird, won't show folder structure and I had to experiment with how to get those private folders/files to be protected on my phone using the forced ""folders"" of Pictures, Videos, etc. The company said they're working on a seamless sharing of protected/encrypted folders/files but no mention when to expect it. That should have been accomplished long ago.

straight to the point for the most part. The only thing that I do wish it 
had was away when you tapped the IP address that is given to not just have 
an option to email it to somebody when it could just be tapped on and 
stored on the clipboard to send it to someone but I can Overlook that 
because when I make the email all I have to do is copy and paste it from 
that and delete the draft. And that's good enough for me. THANK YOU!",5,0,1.0.9,2018-08-13 19:14:05,,

You now have to hit the home page GUI, then browse the root directory for it.  Pay attention to what is written after the ""Current Directory:""  If you want to read/write to or from your external SD card, just browse to:  /storage/extSdCard/  It's  that simple.  When you do this, it will say: Current Directory: /storage/extSdCard/  All of the contents of the external SD card will be available here, but it will not show the size of the SD card on the right side of the screen...still shows my 11.47Gb internal storage capacity but at least I know how big my external SD card is and my phone can tell me the available space on it.   Original Review:  Forget the cables for PC to mobile or even mobile to mobile transfer.  Have you ever purchased a non-OEM cable for your phone and tried to transfer data from your PC to your phone just to find out that your PC can't recognize your device with that cable.  You can now keep those cheap after market cables for charging and just use this app for your data transfers.  Great price and very convenient for file sharing.",4,1,1.0.9,2017-03-07 22:42:17,,

Awesome app. Good interface and it plain works. I love the way it packages bulk files into a single zip file for a continuous and fast file transfer and it makes management of finding what you just transferred to your PC easy. Uploading is also a breeze. Just choose the folder you want to send the files too and hit send. It uses your web browser. Do not give mind to the negative reviews. I have read a few and it simple - those people tend to not understand how to use network software or web browsers as most people do.,5,0,1.0.9,2016-08-23 17:00:18,,

It would be nice if the product had a slightly more modern interface, but the developer probably felt the improvement would not be worth the added expense. I prefer a product that works that seems a little clunky over one that looks pretty but doesn't work. Excellent value. Love the product. Use it all the time.",5,0,1.0.9,2015-08-21 17:37:36,,

We need to exchange data between our phones and PC (I have used it with Windows, Linux as well as Mac) and this app makes it an enjoyable process. Especially for Versions running Kitkat and above, where usb connections are an issue for most, this app is a complete blessing.  I have tried others in passing. Airdroid is good, but is more for using your computer screen instead of your phone screen, for WA, SMS calls etc. However, where exclusive file management is concerned, in my humble opinion this app beats them all, hands down.  It is fast, intuitive, reliable with an easy to work with UI. I use it to very quickly organise files on my phone as well, even if transfers are not required.

If you set a password to protect your device, transfers stop working -- when you try to kick off an upload or download in your web browser, it prompts you for the password in a flashing text box that doesn't permit you to type anything. Disabling password protection in the app's settings allow the transfer to proceed.   The obvious workaround for this is to hit the ""Stop"" button after you do your transfer, shutting down the app. Most likely, none of your neighbors will happen to be searching for mobile devices to hack into in the couple minutes that you're using the app -- but you are leaving your device wide open, so be careful.   ALSO: The app will only send files to the root directory of your device's internal storage. If you want to put the file on your SD card, or a different folder in internal storage, you have to do that as a separate step. If you do this 2nd step through this app's ""Move"" button, it requires you to type the file path by hand (e.g. ""/storage/emulated/0/Movies""). It would be much nicer to be able to navigate by clicking on folders!",3,0,1.0.9,2014-06-12 04:06:16,,

So if you are looking for an specific file you won't find it unless you sift through all the installed  folders. Externally or internally. Which makes it more difficult if you have no idea where a particular file may be stored at.  And the Preview thumbnails for pictures are too small and difficult to distinguish. Unless you hover over for every single one of them . You can transfer FROM the computer multiple files from ONE folder but cannot transfer multiple files from MULTIPLE folders. Other than that it does the transfers back and forth without hassles and the password does work.  I had a particular problem and I can say support is awesome.,2,0,1.0.9,2013-12-29 05:52:55,,

I use it to transfer lots of files to and from my rooted Nook Tablet running 4.2.2. The transfer speed is excellent, and the web interface is clean, quick, and easy to understand.   Look no further - this is the file transfer app you want! :)  I've encountered some issues, but none of them are caused by the app itself - if Wifi File Transfer PRO crashes, or your device reboots suddenly, check to see if another app is running in the background causing issues - in my case ""The Simpsons: Tapped Out"" was causing the problem, and the fault was not with Wifi File Transfer Pro.  Two recommendations/wish lists for future versions of the app:  1. Option to 'keep wifi alive' while in use. On my device, when the screen goes to sleep, Wifi drops, terminating any transfers in progress.   2. An on-screen indication on the Android device as to what is being done would be nice - I often step away from the PC and would like to see how the file transfers are going on the Android devices' screen instead of the static start/stop button.",5,0,1.0.9,2013-12-03 08:54:21,,

I'll be honest and say that I do tend to use a lot of the free versions of many apps that are available, but from the very first time I used this one I knew it was worth the asking price so basically within an hour of using it once I purchased it and haven't regretted it for a single second. Using Wifi File Transfer Pro on my home network (and others as required) saves me a lot of wear and tear on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active microUSB port - I even have the wireless charger for it too so I rarely have to open the little water-resistant protective cover on it.  So if you're sick of swapping cables and plugging/unplugging over and over again just to move some files around, or sick of popping the back cover off to get the microSD card out if you have a phone with one, this is the app for you. Sure it's a bit slower than a true USB wired connection, but considering how much some repair shops charge to fix those microUSB ports when they break, this app pays for itself the first time you'll use it, seriously.  Don't thank me, thank the developer when you do.",5,0,1.0.7,2013-09-13 19:22:45,,

Better than the Kies Air that came with my Samsung Ace Q,(except that I can't select for ringtone, but who cares?).

It's ok, because I just open the files I want & then drag'n'drop them. Very easy. I wish I knew what the issue was with the button tho.  At any rate, the button doesn't subtract anything at all from this great little app.  I'm on gingerbread 3.2.6   The interface is very nice.

In reading the Android forums, it appears that was apparently a glitch and many others experienced the same thing. I use my phone camera a LOT, and got warnings on my phone that I was just about out of room and had to clear some space on it. To keep the phone from crashing and losing the files on my phone, I started to use Google Drive to upload the files to the cloud and then download them from there. What a slow and painstaking process that turned out to be!  Then I found this gem of an app. I paid the $1.49 for the Pro version since many of my video files are well over the 5MB limit on the free version. WOW! I am very impressed with not only how much faster and easier it is over doing it through Google Drive, but it even blows away the performance of the software on the phone that is supposed to be used to do the transfers. Because my phone was so full of pics & videos (24G), it took a few minutes to load everything, but once it did, it was very easy to use.  Now I don't care if Google fixes that glitch or not!",5,0,1.0.6,2013-07-07 12:37:23,,

Creates a mini web server on your phone and the web interface is intuitive and easy to use. The connecting device - whether it be a computer of another phone - doesn't have to be connected to WiFi; it only needs to be able to access the device running WiFi File Transfer Pro. In fact I'm writing this review while uploading a bunch of files to my phone from my laptop that is connected via an Ethernet cable to my company network. I'm using a Motorola Droid RAZR HD as my phone.  In fact, this app made me realize that, along with WiFi Direct, an external SD card is not needed. That was a feature I absolutely needed when I was searching for a new smartphone a few months back. But I never owned a smartphone before I bought my RAZR and just figured I'd need an SD card to easily transfer files. Apps like this make it stupidly easy to move files back and forth. So, when looking for my next smartphone in a year or so from now, I'll ignore the SD card option.",5,0,1.0.4,2013-03-14 07:48:52,,

I purchased the Pro version because many of my manuals are larger than allowed with the free version and I have never had the first problem with it. What got me to try this app in the first place is that it runs on my local network and not through a third party server nor is it necessary to install additional software on any of the computers I access.
