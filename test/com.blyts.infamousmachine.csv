Cartoon style is different and has certain appeal. Generally speaking the game play is collecting and using correct objects at different locations. There are a limited number of locations in each chapter which does mean a lot of to-ing and fro-ing and this gets a little frustrating as you have to guide the character across screen.

First, you can only tap on things, no look, no use, no open, no pull, no talk, only tap on things. And there are many things in the environment that you cant tap on, so I'm constantly holding down on the screen just to see what I can tap on. I like to look at something before I pick it up, so I know what I'm picking up, nope not here, you tapped on it now whatever it is, is in your inventory. Also the pace at which the character walks is too slow, I think just to make the game longer. The voices cut out sometimes so I have to keep the subtitles on just to know what is being said and the voice acting is ok at best.

For the first 30 minutes you won't see anything and just click on hotspot indicators. If you want to see more you will have to play in a dark room which you probably won't since this is a mobile (!) game. Maxing out the background illumination on my Galaxy S6 didnt help. Other than that an ok but for modern point and click genre standards unremarkable game. Neat art style but mediocre animations.,3,12,1.0.7,2016-12-01 15:23:41,,
