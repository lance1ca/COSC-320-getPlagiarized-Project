As I tend to spend quite a lot of time doing amateur time-lapse videos manual exposure and ISO controls are critical to what I'm trying to do, these are present and correct on the Windows version but nowhere to be found on this version... maybe it's just my phone that's at fault?  If this situation somehow changes in the future then I may be back, otherwise it seems I'll have to look elsewhere for an appropriate app for my purposes (or go back to the Windows phone).  <edit> It seems that manual exposure isn't even possible on 4.4, maybe something for a Lollipop update? ;)",3,3,3.3.8,2015-02-11 16:24:13,,

Now, it records video with or without the headphones :) But still wished the camera had option to control focus manually like in Nokia Lumia 1020 series (focus dial in video record mode) and also wished I could record in a flat profile (any suggestions?)
