It be nice if you could give yourself enough ex to level up. Then it helps to show you what you've unlocked. Very nice starting point app though.",4,5,22,2020-12-21 00:04:27,,

For example: i wanted to use a race that are not among the ones that are in the core rulebook, therefore it wasn't available in the app and i also had no way to add it. I do like the app, and if you make room for customization, i would love to use it instead of the pdf :)",3,2,,2020-12-18 15:12:10,,

Contains content from every book, as far as i can tell. Worth spending money on. One thing that would improve it would be the ability to add 3rd party or custom content if you wanted.
