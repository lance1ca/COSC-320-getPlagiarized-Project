My family loved to play it. I upgraded to the new Shield over Christmas to find out this app is not compatible with the current model (2019 NVIDIA SHIELD). Please update this app!!! it's a 5 star app if I can play it... 1 star until then.,1,9,1.1.1,2020-02-23 18:20:48,,

If this gets fixed I will redo my rating.",1,9,1.1.1,2020-02-01 09:11:05,,
