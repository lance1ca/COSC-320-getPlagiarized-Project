This one is far better than other apps I have experienced. It is very customizable to each users needs. They continually add options that make it even better. Unlike some apps, the updates usually present you with options instead of forcing you to change to a new way when you may have liked the old way better. If you like the app, buy it. I believe this will encourage them to continue taking care of it.  Update: some alarms failing to go off. So far unable to troubleshoot.

This happens randomly but before I stopped using it it was becoming more frequently. I never had this issue on my S4. Another grievance is that the alarm doesn't show nicely in landscape mode. If you use the math to snooze option you have to scroll down to see the number keys, and up to see the problem. Annoying if you have your phone in a dock that has the phone in landscape mode. I have emailed the developer about the issue with the S7, but never got a response.  Another thing that would be nice is Google calendar, or Tasker integration.

It also allows you to setup many different categories to group your alarms into, to keep the main screen from getting cluttered with alarms. It is very useful to me to be able to separate the alarms I want to go off on a permanent basis, from those that are one-time reminders to do something today (or at any future date). There are very flexible settings for the snooze function: you can set a default and all future alarms will use that snooze interval. Or you can set it to ask you what you want the snooze duration to be each time the snooze runs out. I've moved most of the calendar reminders from Outlook to Smart Alarm.

So I have to remember to run the app before going to bed otherwise there is a very good chance that the alarm will not fire and I'll oversleep.  I don't have any memory optimizers or app killers running, so that is not the issue.
