Is it the average speed / time spent traveling or average speed / distance traveled? The reason I ask is, if you go for a walk for half an hour at 2 mph, and then travel in a car at a much greater speed, the ""average speed"" remains at a low value for an extended period of time.

My current setup works perfectly, automatically switching digitalhudpro on & off when the vehicle ignition goes on & off but it's a bit of a pain (which, to be honest, is often forgotten) trying to remember to switch off the phone before setting off driving....... And on again when leaving the vehicle.  Yet again, THANK YOU for a fabulous and straight forward, easy to use 6* app    This is, without doubt, the best app I've ever had, I use it continuously and now use an old android phone JUST for this app.  It's proved itself super reliable over the last 3 years or so that I've been using it, with many unexpected, useful, little extras. It's a world apart from so many other lesser, apps. I spend a lot of time driving outside the UK in a UK car - the Metric/Imperial simple changeover is a Godsend when outside the UK. (The kilometer speeds can be easily read by my slightly older eyes!)The app is far more accurate than the vehicles' own equipment (which is about 10% out)  A massive THANK YOU to the app developers for this one, it's truly a pleasure to use and worth every penny.

The app is THAT good.  Accurate, useful and user friendly with nice features.  My speedometer is blocked by the steering wheel when tilted at a comfortable position.  I have my phone mounted on the dash with DigiHUD running and clearly visible.   I've tried many speed apps.  This one is by far the best.  Two suggestions:  Please add the road speed limit to the display, similar to GPS map devices like Garmin, with DigiHUD's speed alert auto synched to the posted speed limiit,  and; the ability to record video of various loop durations, if possible.  My phone won't run DigiHUD and the video camera concurrently.  I know that's asking a lot, but those additions would make a great app even better.  Great job, James!",5,4,1.0.7,2014-10-19 09:03:48,,
