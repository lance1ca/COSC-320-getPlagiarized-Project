Google's own app also now lets you download routes for offline use and this app will still work if data coverage is lost in a bad area. All you have to do is think ahead to what type of area you may be traveling to and download ahead of time with the Google Maps app if you think coverage may be spotty. This app doesn't have a mini map on your watch like some of the others but that is of very little use due to being so small anyway. What it does have are Google's actual turn by turn directions with how many miles or feet till your next turn or merge, and a vibration when you are 100ft from your turn. Along with Google's absolutely excellent voice directions, you have everything you could possible need. It keeps in absolutely perfect  sync with Google Maps.
