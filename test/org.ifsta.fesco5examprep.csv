It is a useful study aid and the provided page numbers and study deck are great. However, I need to ding the app for not being super user friendly. The biggest issue being that it will not save your progress on a quiz. Multiple times I've been going through a 500 plus question quiz and I'll accidentally hit the back button and completely lose my place, or the app will go idle and I have to start over again. It's very frustrating.",3,4,1.2.228,2019-05-11 09:22:48,,
