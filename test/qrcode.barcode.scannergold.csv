Had to replace 2 phones and re-input barcodes and info with another app, but with this app I can have all barcodes and info, then export it and if ever have to replace my phone I can just import them in. Already did it with another phone. I can't wait till they have a search within the app so that I can bring up the barcode and scan with my other phone, for now I have to manually search for that barcode and info, but by me shortening the notes helps. Please add the search option.",5,0,1.0.0,2020-08-31 10:39:33,"Merhaba, gerekli düzenleme yapılacaktır. Desteğiniz de dolayı teşekkür ederiz.
