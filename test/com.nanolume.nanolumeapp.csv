Doctor who administered cortisone into my foot. This is much easier than 
writing it down. Particularly as I'm not very mobile currently, it's saving 
me from hunting down pen and paper. However, there is one very big flaw. 
Hence why 3 stars and not 5. I cannot zoom into a limb to draw the pained 
area accurately. I'd suggest that at the next update, the development team 
look at hands, feet and head having an additional and separate page each or 
at the very least, allow for a zoom facility. It's near impossible to draw 
a pain area that consists of one toe and a bit of surrounding tissue, yet 
such data would be very valuable for the physician.",3,3,1.50,2018-06-02 06:47:35,"Hello Wayne. We added the ""zoom"" feature you suggested shortly after you brought this need to our attention.
