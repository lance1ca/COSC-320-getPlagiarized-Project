The characters, animation, and range of settings are great. I was easily able to pick a slower speed and reduce the symbol size to my liking, as well as tweaking the color. I haven't played with the photo feature yet, but it seems like a great idea. And the idea to reverse the flow when charging was clever. Thanks for a great live wallpaper!",5,1,1.4.5,2021-01-23 17:01:46,"Thank you for your great review! The default settings try to match the movie's animation as in the very first seconds of the episode one, hence the default speed. UPDATE: The latest version of the application has just been released. You'll notice that the range has expanded in both slow and fast speeds. Again, thanks for your feedback!",2021-01-12 17:09:13
