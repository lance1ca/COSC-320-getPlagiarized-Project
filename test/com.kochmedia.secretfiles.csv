I have only played a handful of games through to the end, and this is one of them. The graphics are nice, the storyline is excellent, and it makes you want to keep playing to find out what happens next. There were two errors that I found. First, in the naming of objects (on the rare occasion I used the hint system). The hint system calls objects by very weird names, and often it is not the name used for the object in the game itself, so it was sometimes tricky figuring out what specifically was being referred to. It's a relatively minor issue, but still a bit weird/frustrating at times. The bigger error was in saving - the game almost never saved exactly where I was progress-wise. I usually had to redo several things I had done prior to the last save when resuming the game, which got annoying. That said, this game is absolutely a must-have for anyone who likes casual adventure gaming. The game itself offers pleny of playtime (more than almost any other adventure game I've tried), and when you're done there are some really funny ""extras"" to watch as well. Definitely worth the money. For me, it's on to the next game in the series!",5,4,1.0.28,2015-02-18 17:06:50,,
