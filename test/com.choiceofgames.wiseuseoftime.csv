You are a normal person that suddenly gains the ability to stop time. What this story does well is sell the normal person part. Working for the life insurance company was kind of boring and the boss fights were somewhat anticlimactic. The characters in game are very well developed and the plot was good too. The author did a great job with world building and tying up loose ends at the end. Its got romance and replayability. Overall it's a good read.,4,6,1.1.2,2020-10-09 20:48:19,,

There's so many different routes you can do! Two things I'd like to say though; Firstly, the relationship point system is somewhat inaccurate. Ex- The main character always treats their roommates as friends, even when they're labeled ""enemy"". Secondly, can you make a route where befriending Barnabas is possible? The most you can do at the moment is get him to trust you enough to be led to the scientist. The most relationship points I've gotten with him so far is ""adversary (71)"".",5,6,1.1.2,2020-05-20 20:09:44,,

It runs smoothly on my tablet, and I love the fact that it works in landscape as well as portrait modes (I wasn't sure if it would based on the photos above). The story is fun, but as a writer I have to say it feels forced quite often. Nobody runs into that many accidents, burglaries, etc around them every single day. I've played other, similar games by other companies that managed to pull off the ability to choose your adventure, shape your character (in even more depth than this game allows), etc without the storyline feeling so forced (read: fake), so I know it's possible to make that happen and wish the dev had found a better writer. Also, the story sometimes flat out ignores your decisions. For example, on one page I chose not to tell my roommates about my ability, but the very next page acknowledged that choice then said that I decided to tell them anyway because it wasn't fair to keep it from them. Annoying, as I had good reason to keep it from at least one of those people. Overall, it was more fun than not, but I'll probably stick with other devs' products in the future.",4,25,1.0.4,2015-09-16 09:16:29,,
