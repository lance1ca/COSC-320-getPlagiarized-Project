However, sadly you cannot listen to audio and watch video (it's one or the other), and the video playback when remote is fairly slow - it appears when you're remote, the video feed is streamed through a server far from me, rather than through a more local cloud-based server, or at least device-to-device, which results in the round trip time being longer than necessary, and the video playback being super slow. You get can around this by setting up a VPN service within your home, and connect to that before using the app, and you'll stream HD with no problem at all.

Please add a separate ""Doggy Is Noisy"" Android notification which stays in the notification shade until dismissed. This would allow me to receive alerts on my watch and also check on noises that happened while I could not be near my phone.

Generally, this is a really useful app and can't be beat considering the price. I have had issues with it crashing partway through the day: refusing to connect to the dog station.   It would be great if the dog station could log barks, regardless of whether a person station is running. That way I wouldn't have to constantly pay attention to my phone, and the  person station wouldn't always have to run (&run down my phone battery). It would be really useful to graph barks over time to see when problematic times are.

We saved so much time and money on an app that fits our lifestyle and eases our mind when we are away from our dog for short periods of time.  Customer service is extremely helpful if you have any questions/concerns.  I am not tech saavy at all and this was easy to set up and go within minutes especially using two separate systems.
