I've applied Spiricom tones, Spiritron application(13 tones of Spiricom), and a variety of audio via radio, phonemes, and other, through EVP Maker software as well. This application provided excellent results!! One thing, is I wish there was finer settings for scan rate. Need more than 2 settings for scan rate. Also, radio is pre-recorded files from scanning radio??",5,10,2.10,2020-08-29 19:02:22,Hello! Thank you for your feedback.

Thank you for your comment.
