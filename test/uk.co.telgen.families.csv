I've read some of the negative reviews and they seem to be mostly about not being able to sync their devices with their Legacy files. I have not had any problems doing this with my Android; it works well for me. Having my genealogy data with me at all times has been a lifesaver. When I go to a library/archive or out of town on a research trip, I am able to look up anyone I have a question about to be sure I have the right person, right dates, right places, etc. There's no way I can remember all the details for everyone in my file, so the Families app is essential for me. One of the best things about the app is that when I am at a family gathering, my relatives will come to me knowing that I'm the family historian and ask me questions. I grab my phone, look up the person in question, and am able to provide the answer since I have the person's details as well as all my notes and sources in the Families app. People are very impressed when they see that. I love this app!",5,7,3.2.3,2020-07-16 08:12:57,,
