Every sound you could need to locate, call down or call in a turkey in any situation. Each sound has a mouth call and slate call sound bite along with tips when it's best to use. Add in the suggested sequences and you are in your way to speaking the language of turkey. It's the Rosetta Stone of turkey talk! Already I have changed my calling approach thanks to Scott's guidance and enjoying the harvest. Highly recommended, Kevin Hardman",5,1,2.0.1,2020-04-23 22:40:14,,

The app helps out with how to use various turkey calls in certain situations, calling instructions and calling sequences. With the small interaction I've had with Scott via DM or his IG Live videos he is more than willing to help out anyone that has a passion for turkey hunting, novice or advanced. Top notch dude if you ask me. Good luck and God bless!",5,1,2.0.1,2020-04-23 12:20:06,,

Thank you for the review. If you would, please shoot me an email at tayler@gotgametech.com, and we’ll make sure all the videos are downloading for you. On occasion, due to the size of a few of the videos, they take a while to download, and if that process is interrupted, then the download won’t finish. Look forward to hearing from you.",2020-02-19 22:26:30
