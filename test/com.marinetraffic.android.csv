My friend in Poland sent me a couple of photos that he shot of a cargo ship passing him on a relatively small waterway. It was the LONGVANN. Now I follow the LONGVANN and with Google maps I can get closer look at the ports and the clues of what the LONGVANN is transporting.

Just for peace of mind. However the new update today means that when I look at the ship's information it doesn't fit upon the screen like the older version did, it just looks a bit messy and if I try moving the screen so I can read the info on the ship it ends up disappearing and Just showing me the map. Plus if a vessel location hasn't been updated and you try Searching for it then it doesn't appear in the list. Please go back to the older version",3,48,3.7.2,2018-02-13 16:28:27,,

I'm just a hobbyist using it to monitor my home port and so far it has done everything I have asked of it which is not surprising as once I visited the website I realised that really this is aimed towards the professional user (and has pricing options to match!) - guess I've just become cynical with some of the rubbish that abounds on Goggle Play....  So given thats the angle I'm coming from here are a couple of things / improvements I would like to see in the future.  It would be great if user generated off-line maps could be viewed so public domain charts or annotated charts could be used as the chart option is prohibitively expensive for a hobbyist. I am using wifi so I dont know whether this would be good for mobile users also rather than having to access the same data over and over..  It could do with a +/- zoom button option to ease 1 finger use.  The ship info ""bubble""would be better related to ship icon rather than interface size.  The ports option would benefit from a basic frequency / channel list although I realise that for world wide coverage this is probably a whole new project in itself.
