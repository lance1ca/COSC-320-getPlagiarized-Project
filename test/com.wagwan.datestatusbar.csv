There are Free version of all our apps available which allow you to get the look and feel you need and then you can purchase the Pro version if you like. The difference with the Pro version it has more color options and no ads.

As we stated in your previous review for this features to work the app needs to be installed on the phones memory and Not the sd  card. This is a bug on Android and not our app. The app was recently tested and works fine on auto start. If you need to discuss this further email us on wagwanapps@gmail.com

This is because the app is installed on the SD card and not the phone. Because the phone initializes the SD card at the end of the start up process sd card  apps that need to start up miss the call from the phone to start. This is a well known bug on some android devices.
