Everything that was great about Golf Peaks is present here: wordless, smartly designed tutorial stages that introduce concepts, a tranquil, calming visual and audio aesthetic, and a very confident difficulty curve that ramps up smoothly. The visuals are minimalist but utterly charming, and the gameplay simple but compelling. The reason I am giving this three stars vs. the five I rated Golf Peaks is...I just don't find it as fun. And the main reason is how difficult it is to iterate on solutions to levels. Once they get complex, it can be difficult to identify which ""layer"" of pieces need to go in first (blocks, pieces to move blocks, etc.), and as a result I was more often than not starting stages from scratch - rather than backing up a few moves - to start a new approach. This quickly grew very frustrating. About midway through the game now, I have hit a particularly complex level and gotten stuck, cold. Been stuck for days, but while Golf Peaks stumped me now and then, that game was always fun to go back and iterate on my approach to solve it, and I cleared all levels, including the newly released challenge course. Here, that process just isn't as fun because of the need to reset over and over. This might be a way of saying the game is too hard for me - it is - but there's something about the main design that made solving the levels much of an enjoyable process than others puzzlers I've played; the process of slowly dialing in on a solution and then cracking it, just wasn't there for me. It clearly is for others, so YMMV.",3,129,1.06,2019-10-11 10:17:52,"Thanks for the detailed review.
