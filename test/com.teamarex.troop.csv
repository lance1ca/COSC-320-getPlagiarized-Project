It's so good and so rich, combat is easy to learn but punishing if you decide to relax, the story is great and at one point 2 of my knights started talking together.

Loved the combat mechanics and art style. Procedurally generated and perfect amount of difficulty. I beat it on normal on my third attempt but I had sunk 3.5 hours on it üò≠. Did it all in one time and it didn't even feel that long, I thought maybe an hour had past. Even though I beat it once there is still more new enemies I haven't faced and still more story I have to discover as well as side quests I missed. Not to mention I need to try out hard mode. Sequel pls!",5,12,2.221,2019-12-31 02:19:04,"Thank you for the positive and helpful review! :D We're really happy to hear that you liked playing Unknown Knights.
