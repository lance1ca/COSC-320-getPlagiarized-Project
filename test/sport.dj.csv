Many, many great features, and give it a strong 4.  However, there are significant issues that need prompt attention: 1.  The settings drop-down menu at the top right of the display is completely obscured in portrait and landscape when the large buttons profile is being used, and mostly obscured when the default mode is in portrait.  The only way to access the lower portion of the drop-down menu with the 'New Game' toggle is in landscape in default mode.  Please fix. 2. In order to link a button with music or sounds, you have to define the directory where that music or sound is located.  So while you can easily browse to the chosen directory, you cannot actually select the directory - you must type in the directory filename.  This is very counter-intuitive and frustrating. 3.  There appears to be a lag when you start/stop songs from a playlist in rapid succession.  I have encountered two songs playing at once as a result. 3 Recommendation: Provide a large toggle named 'MUTE' that overrides everything.",4,1,Version 17,2018-02-26 07:09:57,Thanks for the review Dan and reporting of the problems.

The best app of its kind for playing music at sporting events. Version 7 made the button labels easier to deal with and fixed a couple issues with timing and stability. Bumping up the rating from 4 to 5 stars but would still love to see a scrubber for previews, and a smaller font\better list when importing songs.  Criminal this isn't over 1000 downloads yet! Completely worth your 3$ and more. Buy it now, set it up, and give your kids team an almost pro level presentation.",5,1,Version 7,2016-01-10 22:23:06,Thanks Matt.  More features are now available in version 10.  You can change the font size in the settings.  Also there is a new UI that allows you to see which song will play next on the buttons.,2016-09-27 18:56:56

Also it would help if it would play music at same level as sometimes it is not heard and others it is blaring.,3,0,Version 5,2015-11-09 15:29:40,Version 7 (now available) resolves the stability issues on some devices.  Sport DJ plays songs at the recorded volume level and downloading songs from different sources can cause the problem you describe.  I have a separate volume control device to easily adjust the volume on the fly.  The volume controls on a phone/tablet are not great for this.,2015-12-06 04:26:28

Ability to refine the interface. I don't need the song list on the main interface. I'd like larger buttons so that I don't press the wrong one. Some choices would be WONDERFUL.  2. Ability to create buttons for my own playlists. (Apologies if that option is there and I missed it.)  3. Ability to set start point in a song (minutes/seconds) and the fade-in time.  Thanks for the effort you put into this!  Nov 8th 2015 update: It turns out most of the features I asked for were already there, but I missed them. Bumped review to five stars. This addresses 99% of my issues. The app's author was also incredibly helpful via e-mail -- best Google app support I've ever had. Seriously think this app is worth $10.  We were livecasting a minor hockey game last night and the parent doing the play-by-play is not a 'techie' and found the app super easy to use to fill dead air during stoppages of play. He's an Apple owner who is looking to buy a Droid tablet specifically to use this app.",5,1,Version 5,2015-11-08 06:47:54,Thanks Sean.

And goal horn together makes a minor league game feel like the BIG LEAGUES.  Could be improved by allowing for a pause/start button so that if there's a quick whistle, users don't have to begin a new song but instead pause then continue with the current one.  When in, say the 'special' songs section, change the song list to reflect what under this button.",4,0,Version 4,2015-01-07 10:49:49,Version 5 now has the feature to continuing playing the last song where you left off.

This app is great it lets you set playlist easily for game stoppages intermissions penalties goals and works flawlessly.  You can even merge the sample goal horns with songs just like the big stadiums do.  It only takes a few minutes to get your playlists set under each button.  Awesome.

Version 5 now allows you to customize the fade out time from zero to 1.5 seconds.  The default is 0.5 seconds.
Let me know if you have any other suggestions.  Thanks.
