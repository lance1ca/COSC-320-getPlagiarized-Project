The :beacon of time"" idea especially allowed devs to double the content in very creative way that fits the setting. Very replayable, as there are many options that are not obvious during the first playthrough, I replayed the game many more times compared to the first two. The QoL changes like improved rewinding was another nice feature. Certainly looking forward to the part 4.
