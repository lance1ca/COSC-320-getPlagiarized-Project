The demo was very buggy but I was interested in the game anyway - glad to see that this version is somewhat less buggy, though not perfect.  Can have 2-4 armies on the board at any time. Comes with 4 unique armies, and I'm interested in buying the expansions (5 extra armies, £5.87, or each army is £1.46). The challenge is learning how to play each army to best effect, and how to exploit weaknesses in the enemy army.  Anyway, it was easy enough to learn and it's fun to maximise your chances. (Though, luck of the draw plays a big part and even the best laid plans can be pointless when you draw 6 movement tiles over two turns while nothing can move - as happened to me.)

I know some people complain about online multiplayer, but I believe online multiplayer won't make the game any better or worse. The only reason why this game is Average and not Excellent is the AI. In a 1v1 situation the AI is great, but as soon as you go to 1v2or3 the AI has one strategy; Kill the human and neutralize any immediate threat.
