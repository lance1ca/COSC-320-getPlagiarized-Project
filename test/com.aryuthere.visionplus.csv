Quickly gives you the ability to fly autonomously so that the camera is steady for video shots.  Allows you control speed, and orientation in sensible ways.   Has track, follow, orbit, waypoint, features so you can easily program a route and go take video.  Plus a lot of other features I haven't figured out yet. My galaxy tab e seems to like it.

Another thing that really stinks about this app is that when you want to look at the pictures you have to force close the litchi app and then go over to the DJI app and look at the pictures in there. The litchi app should be able to do all of this from its own app. It's a pain in the neck to look at the pictures that you took in the litchi app. Can't really say it's worth it.

I downloaded this app specifically for the Waypoints program. And to be fair this would be at least a 4 star review if it weren't for the fact that you have to do business or shoot films in the middle of nowhere to get it to work. After many forums read, it appears Litchi blames this on DJI, which is probably true considering DJI's Orwellian business style. Though, it doesn't make sense to me that I can override DJI in certain zones with permission, but Litchi waypoints still won't let me operate the drone. At this rate, I'll be a god at manual flying by the time these two decide to actually align themselves with what the ACTUAL rules with the FAA are.

It offers greater customizability for all the buttons of the Mavic remote compared to DJI GO, and since the interface is different, I 'm still getting used to it. But... aside from the ability to calibrate the IMU, compass AND gimbal, and check for/install firmware upgrades, I can't think of a feature DJI GO has that this doesn't. I find Litchi's interface cleaner and easier to use the more I fly with it, and this may just be me, but... I'd swear Litchi's using less of my phone battery than DJI GO 4.0.1 does for a flight in the same weather, distance and time span. I''d like it if the ""auto-takeoff"" function toggled to ""auto-landing"" when in the air instead of just disappearing, so I could take advantage of landing protection when not returning to home for landings.  I'll update this review if my opinion changes. So far... nice app. Enjoying exploring, and appreciating the manual online.  4-month update: I like this interface better than Go, find it easier to use, and it DOES use less battery. The only thing I ever use Go for anymore is IMU calibration, and occasionally reading the compasses.",4,13,3.10.8,2017-05-16 13:01:46,,

The picture quality is better than the DJI APP. I sent it out on the second way point mission with a cruising altitude of 98 feet.  I got too close to a water tower lost GPS and my drone crashed into the water tower at 60 feet and is stuck on the water tower over the weekend until I can get permission to retrieve it. The sad part is it has been raining pretty hard today and I'm not sure if it is under enough cover to protect the electronics from the eliments. Not sure why it was at 60 feet when it was set 98 feet? After watching some videos on YouTube I see that other people have had problems around water towers. I hope that my drone is salvageable when I retrieve it Monday. Just thought I would write this note so maybe you can learn from my bad experience.

I bought the app for the sole purpose or using my new Google Daydream VR set and my Google Pixel XL. Installed and connected immediately with no problems what so ever.

Got out to the place to fly and everything went great, Really love using the VR Headset to fly.     I also love the fact the you can turn on voice to tell you your alt, and distance . I haven't tried much else cause it was really too cold to be out today but had to try the VR.

The main faults I see in this are that it deviates too much in style from the DJI Go 4 app, being the defult user experience. On to flight modes starting with waypoints. Flat out disappointment, though this might not be primarily Litchi's fault. Waypoints must be a minimum of 2 mins in duration or you cannot do them.  Didnt bother with orbit or follow me, it is a native mode with no additional function in Litchi. I tried out the POI function. Now with this I was impressed. It is a simple function with great potential to get those cinematic flybys. The only things I didnt like was that it seemed to be in a ""sport style"" control mode, in that when you released the sticks it took an inordinate amount of time to stop Pano. Nothing ground breaking here and does a remarkable effort to copy Denis Baldwins Dronepan. A bit slower than Dronepan, but effective. What would have been nice is if someone at Litchi put the time in and calculated the minimum amount of photos required for a 360 Pano with the appropriate of overlap.",3,4,3.10.1,2017-01-01 20:52:14,,

Wow! Takes the DJI Go app to another level... I've only played around with this a little now, not so far very impressed... I like playing with way-points. THIS app allows a few things more - You do not need to fly from location to location. In fact you can draw or plan out your route at home! You also have much more control at the way-points, like pausing or changing the camera and stuff (Something like 6 or 8 things you can do at each point). Here's a selling point for me: At home plan out a route WAY out of range (Just make sure you set a way-point back home before battery runs out).   Very good advancements to the DJI app. Also adds visual tracking, panoramic pics and stuff that I haven't yet tried. Would be 5 stars, but $25 is a bit steep.   ALSO: Shut down (Kill) the DJI app! It will fight you. Also when/if you loose signal and regain it the DJI app will again fight you. I ""Force stop"" it when playing with this...",4,0,3.6.8,2016-09-05 16:39:06,,

It would be great to fly using your goggle mode then hit the button and go to phone camera mode to see in front of you. Also maybe incorporate a full screen goggle mode, split of course for when you want to see all the info. Ideally a 3 hit button to give me in goggle mode 1. VR mode 2.phone camera mode and 3. Full screen mode(split for goggle use). Are you planning on utilizing the mode in DJI 3D that when you rotate your head the P3 rotates? Now my review...GREAT...GREAT...GREAT!! Love it! You have so many more options than DJI Go! 31 channel, Quick buttons for programmable functions, Way points without flying them first, the list goes on and on. Also we found out the way point function will work even if after starting you accidentally unplug your pad. Goggle use review: I use a set of VR goggles off Amazon (VR Box) that are $22.00. The head tilt tied to the gimble is fantastic as is the view. In theory it works great but having to pull off the VR goggles and yank out the phone when wanting an open view is touchy.",5,1,2.7.1,2016-01-28 20:50:52,,

I fly in NAZA Mode and have tested COURSE Lock and HOME Lock as well as FAILSAFE and had zero problems. I had a surprise the other day and see that the app has been updated to remove a bug in using Follow Me when flying with version v3.14 of DJI's firmware. I am looking forward to testing that feature as well as Ground Station. I have conducted my testing using a Nexus 7 tablet running Android 5.1.1. IMPORTANT UPDATE to my initial review . . . VC Tech you were right! Although my Nexus 7 does not have an SD card slot it does store flight logs and Ground Station missions within my device as you advised.. It was an oversight on my part. The flight data logging is way cool!! AEWSOME App!!,5,1,1.3.6,2015-06-11 04:14:49,"To clarify, you do not need an external SD card, just an internal one, which most if not all Android devices have.
