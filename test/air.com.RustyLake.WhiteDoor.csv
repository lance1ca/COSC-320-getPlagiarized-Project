I love all the Rusty Lake games which I just finished playing through. I would like to lodge a small complaint however. I am colorblind and most of your games have at least one color based puzzle. And it sucks. It sucks so much. They ruin the mood of the game for me. These reduce me to guessing or on one occasion googling the answer. Please keep the many colorblind gamers in your thoughts for future projects!,4,61,1.1.23,2020-10-10 12:59:28,"Hello, thanks for your constructive feedback.

It alternates between gameplay screens and cut-scene storyline screens where for some reason you have to push the story along by moving the characters, such as ""he opened his eyes"" and you have to manually open his eyes, which I find rather silly. The puzzles are easier than in other Rusty Lake games, some a bit tedious. The only one I found enjoyable and intellectually stimulating was the ""hacker"" puzzle where you find the personal passwords of the employees. What frustrated me was that controlling the game was a bit glichy, unlike the other RL games I have played, in that for example I try to open a cupboard and only the right side opens easily. After many attempts at the left side I become unsure whether the left side is supposed to opepn at all, so I leave it and then that holds me back in advancing in the game because it finally turns out that opening the left side not only was possible but was essential. The other minor frustration was that the English was poor in a few segments of the game. Maybe pay a native speaker to correct the English?",3,18,1.1.23,2020-08-01 05:49:49,,

It brings a cleaner version of their aesthetic to the party plus satisfyingly kinetic interactions that really sold the entire thing.

It ties into the rusty lake lore and I absolutely love that. And I don't know if I just play too many of these games but I finished in a single sitting. Still a fantastic game! A note to the devs. The dragging mechanic, like when sliding things off screen, is incredibly knacky and you have to get just right otherwise nothing happens.

I would consider this one as a solid stepping stone for more storyline-rich games in the future. Lots and lots of callback for my obsession with the lore, and hell, for the first time ever, I struggle with finding all achievements! Nevertheless, my complaints are with the general: the game is quite short, the puzzles are much easier than usual. I still haven't got used to the new mechanic, since a sudden change from a 3-dimension cube to a 2-sided comic book pulls me out of the common immersive playthrough, when you play as first person. A combination of both mechanics would be nice, though it might seem risky. Look forward to any of your future titles!",5,305,1.0.33,2020-01-09 08:47:56,,

Already my head gears are churning. I can't wait to see how this goes. I have every Rusty Lake/ Cube Escape game on my phone. So, this was a very easy purchase for me. I've been hungry for more since the amazing Paradox one you guys made. (The film was so good as well) I can't believe it's been so long since Hotel. I still play that game from time to time.

But it may not worth the price cuz the game playing time is kinda short. I was expecting more contents or difficulties than ""paradox"". In short, I'd say it's fascinating to see the change of game and story style, but a 7 day treatment for Hill is not enough.",4,22,1.0.33,2020-01-08 16:08:42,"Hi Jason, thanks a lot for liking the switch we made. It took a lot of effort and a year of development to change the style, gameplay and way of storytelling.
