Okay... I guess. It tries to build on The Room games. And it is more ambitious in some of the storytelling aims, with an interesting style. But it has poor collision detection for touch and swipe mechanics (which is pretty important in a game like this) and a very samey pallette that means hidden objects (and, frankly, unhidden objects) tend to be very missable. Way too many of the puzzles are dull takes on the Rubik's cube, and plenty of others are just boring. Play The Room instead",3,1,1.0.4,2020-08-16 11:12:02,,
