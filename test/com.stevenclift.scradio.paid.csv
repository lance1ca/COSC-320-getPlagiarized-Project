This only seems to occur on the playmix. If I remove the station from the playmix & re-add it usually works.  And then I have to go back into my playmix settings and put the station back in the order I want.   2.) No search function.  If the above issue occurs, it can be a big hassle to have to scroll through the full list of stations to find the station to add it again.  The frustration is further magnified by: 3.) Frequent crashes when scrolling through stations. 4.) No playback controls except play/pause.  Sometimes I would like to rewind or fast forward or skip to where I left off if I leave the app.   The Hourly News app on iOS allows this and it uses many of the same feeds.",3,0,2.2,2016-07-04 19:51:45,Would love to earn another star!
