I am a Crew Chief for the UH-60 Blackhawk and this saves me a lot of time in my crew station. It allows me to spend less time fidgeting with a calculator and more time focused outside.

If you do not, your fuel check timer will reset and you will need to start all over.",4,3,1.0,2019-05-31 21:51:03,,
