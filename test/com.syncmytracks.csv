As it insists on performing a full sync of all data, between all known accounts, the minute you add any new account details, and as each sync can take a couple of hours and you can't add any further accounts while it's syncing, it could take a day if you wanted to merge the data from 6 trackers you've played with over a couple of years, into say Endomondo. So probably safest to merge two accounts, delete one of them and repeat.  There are a few cosmetic issues with ENGLISH labels being truncated, as I guess the placeholders were sized for the original Spanish, eg. ""Activity: Accoun Caus:"" on the sync error page.
