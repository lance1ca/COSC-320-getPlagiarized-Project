The character sprites are amateurish and the movement controls are a bit clunky, but these definitely aren't game-breakers.  Why the 3-star rating then? Because I DID find an inexcusable bug/oversight that can completely prevent progression. SPOILERS AHEAD.  In Cyan's Dream, in the Phantom Train sequence, there's a puzzle involving treasure chests. There's a set of 6 ""reference"" chests that are either open or closed that you have to match up with a set of 6 ""switch"" chests in order to progress.   In this port, all 6 reference chests are open, but matching up the switch chests does nothing. Then I tried the arrangement I remember from the original on the switch chests (top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-middle closed), and the door DID open. This basically means that unless you remember the code from the original or look up a guide for the original, you're completely stuck. Even worse, even though Cyan's Dream is optional, if you save inside and don't know the code you could easily be stuck in the dream forever, as there is no way out until it's beaten.

The music is fantastic (I dance to it while playing); it has one of my favorite OST to date. The characters/story is extremely well-written and quite a memorable experience (the cast isn't your regular cast of characters; there are some real zany people in this game [Kefka anyone?]) I also highly enjoyed the change of pace halfway through the game when you enter the WoR, and thought the Esper Magicite system to be a well-developed and easy to use part of the game (that helped make the game easier towards the end due to ALL my characters having become mages.) All in all I give this game a solid 5/5; it's one that has really withstood the test of time and is still just a great as when it came out.

The most welcomed graphic update was to the mine cart escape from the Magitek research facility. The only issue was I wish the D pad overlay could be anchored to a single spot on the screen. All the old SNES bugs are fixed as well (so no vanish/death) but this is an improvement in my opinion. This is a must buy for any fan.,5,0,2.0.8,2015-07-28 22:53:35,,

The story and music are as great as they ever were. The higher-resolution sprites are nice, though the character sprites on the field map look a little too much like Bratz dolls to me. The touch controls and UI changes for the touch screen are pretty good. Supports a controller.  Cons: It hogs the CPU unnecessarily. It pegs the CPU 100% even when you switch to another app, even when FF6 is left on the title screen. This causes my phone to get hot and reduces the battery life to just a few hours. There is no excuse for this, I have a modern phone with good battery life (Sony Xperia Z3 Compact) and the game should not be taxing.  The game also has an obnoxious phone-home feature. I purchased this for an international flight without wifi. Before leaving, I tried it in Airplane Mode and it started up and played. I didn't play it again until the flight home two weeks later,  when it refused to work in Airplane Mode. I was able to get it to work by enabling wifi and connecting to the in-flight network, then disabling wifi once it tried to connect.

Forget the missed opportunity that was a FFIII/IV-style remaster - the ridiculous D-pad made me want to throw my phone against a wall, and the dodgy targeting system resulted in me casting Arise on perfectly healthy characters.

Some folks have noted that there are 2 blue bars on the side of the screen (i.e., the game is 4:3, not 16:10), but this isn't a big deal IMO.  Also, the revised sprites are good!  I've noticed a lot of complaints about these, but the original sprites would look terrible on a 1080 or 720 display.     A little worried that Square won't update the compatibility of this (or any Final Fantasy games) for ART in the upcoming Android L release.  If any of the Square reps are reading these reviews, can you give us any  info here?  Leaving 3 stars until I see ART compatibility.  Edit Oct 8th, 2014:  Another thing that needs attention from Square Enix is that there is NO way to back up your saved games on an unrooted phone.  Thats a pretty big inconvenience to anyone changing phones, especially if they don't want to repeat the hours and hours of progress they made.  Taking away another star until is this addressed, and no movement on ART compatibility with Android L coming down the pipe is also a concern......

It may be more literal, but Woolsey's take was more fun.   3. The virtual stick.  Probably the single worst and most distracting thing about this port.  PC adventure game developers figured out how to move a character around in a 2D environment long ago, Square-Enix.  Just tap the ground where you want to walk, or tap the object or NPC you want to interact with.  Is that so hard?    4. The app has to phone home to launch.  Actually, THIS is the worst thing about this game.  Come on, Squeenix. I paid 15 smackers for this half-assed port, and I can't even play it with the phone on airplane mode?

Because it is on a tablet, Square Enix opted to provide an odd d-pad control that makes navigating difficult. It certainly takes getting used to and even then the control is simply not intuitive. Fortunately enough, most traveling is not time sensitive or nothing will ever get done!  The second problem is the big one. In order to play the game, Square Enix requires the player to be connected to the internet to make sure that the copy of FFVI is valid.

I also suspect many gamers like myself lack 3g/4g, and because when I travel (about once a month by plane) I often have no access to even wifi, I cannot play the game because of Square's insistence on being online to boot up the game. If piracy is a reason for this decision, with no gameplay changes or real add-ons in terms of items or weapons, are the differences between this and ported version that different?   After reading the reviews since the game's release, the most commonly reported complaint is a lack of an option for a fixed d-pad.

Now controls, not gonna lie they take some getting used to, the 8-way movement is finicky (I know you can change it to 4-way in options, it didn't help) the battle system's touch controls were fine to get around and the autofight button elevated the hassle of frantically tapping every fight, Sabins blitz, really not a big hassle everyones making it out to be, not hard to figure out.

I was so excited for this port because Final Fantasy VI is my favorite RPG of all time. But It will not work on my phone with Xposed installed. Like it will not even load. Period. I am refunding until they can fix  this issue. There should be no reason for Square Enix to block phones using Xposed. I am highly disappointed and lost a lot of faith in Square because of this.,1,20,1.0.0,2014-01-15 08:55:33,,

A pointless block that renders the game useless.	There's nothing more to say. The game flat out will not boot with Xposed installed and active.
