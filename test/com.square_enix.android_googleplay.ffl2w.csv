That said, the annoying stuff about f2p RPGs--gacha systems, stamina--have all been removed from this version. Still, if you don't enjoy those types of games, you won't like this one. But if you're not put off by the design of mobile RPGs, then you'll enjoy FFD2. It can become repetitive, but that's probably not an issue if you're looking for an easy way to spend time with auto battle on.  This game has a lot of content; I spent about 35 hours on the first story arc, and there's plenty more side quests and a second story left to go. The story isn't amazing, but it's enjoyable. It's sometimes nonsensical--one sidequest in a post-apocalyptic future involves confiscating video game systems, but who's even manufacturing them during that time period?--and the world doesn't always feel tight and fleshed out.
