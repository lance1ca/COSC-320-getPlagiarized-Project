Come on, that's ridonkulous.... I love noisli and used it for a long time until they implemented a daily timer, and took away a lot of the features. On top of that when using the android app, I like to a lot of times to play background music with the white noise and that's not possible. It's either one or the other.

One is that the sound keeps playing on headphone remove. I noticed the developers mentioned they were working on this, but the app hasn't been updated since April, which is a little concerning. Also, the app doesn't suspend or close itself after muting it for a while, which uses more energy than necessary. Finally, it seems to use an unusual amount of battery. I get constant notifications from my phone saying that the app is draining my battery, which is understandable when sound is playing but shouldn't happen when nothing is playing. I've never had a battery usage issue with any other app (including music players) , and this one just plays a couple of sounds. Very unusual.

So many areas for improvement. Biggest concern is missing notification for background playback. No visualization for countdown timer.  Timer countdown timer setup is very painful. Although it does meet app's UI, it's not a good UX.  Continuing developing app further, fade out feature has only 3 predefined timers (1-15-30s), it would be much nicer to spread fading-out to longer period of time. Also fade-in feature would be really nice as a alarm clock for example.  As a biggest disappointment is the fireplace sound.

High quality realistic sounds, a timer and a clean design that makes it easy to use. What else could you ask for? Worth a dollar if you act now or two if you wait till later. It scales between screen sizes, but doesn't rotate in landscape mode, so if you are using a tablet or phone in landscape orientation it works, but is sideways (to be fair, the IOS version suffers this too). I would like to at least see it rotate to landscape mode to take advantage of tablets and phones with front facing speakers.
