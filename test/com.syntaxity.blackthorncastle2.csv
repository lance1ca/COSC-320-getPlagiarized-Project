I love this game. I only have 2 pieces of confusion. The first is that the flute puzzle doesn't connect with it's clue. It tells me to play incorrect notes. My second problem is when I try to restart the game after having beaten it, unless I close the app the backpack doesn't show up. I otherwise love how long you made the game, and how engaging it was.",4,7,1.2,2020-08-14 13:36:44,,
