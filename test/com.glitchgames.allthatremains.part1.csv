Good game. The gameplay itself is well-executed and there weren't any bugs or glitches that I came across. Puzzles are fun and have a good balance between obvious and cryptic. The voice acting is okay. The girl's is very well done but the male voices are a bit exaggerated and the tone doesn't match the situation they are in. Two critiques though. *minor spoilers* First, when you go into the bedroom the main character asks if she remembers having sleepovers and her response is ""that's why I never go down there"". Odd..but ok. Later on the main character talks about how creepy the shelter is and she has the same exact response. I think the latter makes sense and the former is the wrong dialogue response. Second, in the sections that have the ""my furture self is the past of my brother whatever"" puzzles. I had no idea those were two separate floors. It just looked like the door was half open. I eventually had to find a walkthrough to see that was what I was missing. Consider making delineating the floors a little better. I also had max brightness on. Cheers~",4,9,1.0.6,2018-11-16 16:24:59,"Thanks for the review!

Re: the 1st issue, the ""that's why I never go down there"" is implying that yes, she does remember the sleepovers, and never lived them, so chooses not to go down there now. And the reason she didn't like them is specified in the second response of it being ""creepy"".
