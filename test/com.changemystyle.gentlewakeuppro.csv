Before I purchased on of those wake-up lamps from Amazon, I decided to explore the Google Play store and I came across this app. It's about as close to perfect as you can get. The wake-up alarm gives you so many ways to wake up... wake up to light only, sound only, or a combination of both. Adjust the levels of light and/or sound, how fast they get brighter or louder, choose from a wide variety of sounds including nature, industrial, cheerful music, or even your own sounds/music. For example, I wake to both 'sunrise' and low bird song because I love camping and this recreates that early morning experience for me. At the designated alarm time, the song birds stop singing, and one of the gentle melodies plays softly. When I turn off the alarm, I'm greeted with an inspiring message of my own on the screen. After than I can review the current weather and the upcoming weather for the day. All of this happens within the app. At night I use the 'Sleep Timer' to lull myself to sleep with a 'sunset' and the rhythmic low sound of a dryer which slowly decreases in volume. I use the 'Power Nap' function to either catch a quick 20-minutes snooze, or to replace distracting background noise with something more pleasant as I meditate. There is also a countdown calendar function and a nightstand clock function, neither of which I use myself, but I can see how they might be useful to others. As a result of this app, I've noticed that my sleep has improved and I wake up in a much better mood ready to take on the day. It only took me a few days of testing the free version to upgrade to the Pro version. I have it installed on all my Android devices now. It's a well thought out program that I strongly recommend for anyone who wakes up grumpy, or who has trouble falling asleep. It's my hope that the author doesn't try to 'enhance' it to the point where it starts to get bloated with frivolous features.",5,10,4.6.8,2020-01-23 15:37:44,,

But it works on  Gentle Wakeup app. The only thing I think needs to be improved upon, or  fixed I should say, is if you're using sound to wake up you, there appears to be a cutoff before the alarm sound increases (but the time it takes before the sound starts depends on the duration you set for ""Rise duration"") and the duration for when it increases thereafter also depends on the duration you set for ""Rise duration"".  I ran some tests. Assuming the ""Start to rise"" is set to wakeup time, if the ""Rise duration"" is set to 0 min, the start cutoff is 6 sec and the increase volume takes half second. If it's set to 1 min, the start cutoff is 11 sec and the increase volume takes 6 seconds. If it's set to 2 min, the start cutoff is 17 sec and the increase volume takes 17 seconds.
