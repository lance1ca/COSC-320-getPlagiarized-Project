Rangefinder There really is no use of it in this game,  I would love to use that equipment and don't put it in feet,  use yards becaused that's really what it should be.  2. Make the deer stop when he/she is close,  to me I don't want to be shooting a deer when it's on the move.  3. Long range shooting I tried long range shooting and have no luck hitting when the cross hair is dead on.  4. Be able to adjust/move blind and treestands I don't want to keep spending $400 to make a new one.  5. Controls are okay but...  Have more options in settings to adjust.  6. Overpriced!!!  Buying licences or equipment is crazy,   I know you need some way to make money but its really overpriced 7. More game to kill Have more choice of animals  8 .  Finding deer When I shoot at broadside or head-on deers,  some drop but some run,  I give if about 2-3 minutes and then track the deer,  but when I get close to them,  they're still alive even if they are shot in the vitals.  9. Despawning deer I've shot a couple of deers and tracked them,  but if they are still alive,  they de-spawn....  To me that's a waste of time,  fix that problem.  10. Bad tutorial When you start games these days,  they show you a tutorial,  you don't even show how to hold the middle of the screen to make calls,  user range finder,  use binoculars,  use map,  use dog,  return to lodge.   OVERALL!!  I feel like this game was rushed,  like you didn't try it yourself and see if it didn't have any problems,  this game really has some potential,  its different from other hunting games.  I have no knowledge in creating games but I'm giving you constructed criticism/tips to improve your game,  I am not refunding the game because I like it.  Just need some fixes!",4,1,1.5,2017-12-27 22:06:09,,
