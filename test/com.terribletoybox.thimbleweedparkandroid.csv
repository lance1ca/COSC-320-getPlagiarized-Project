the gameplay will be extra long and challenging. I have NEVER paid this 
much for an android game. While $10 isn't a lot of money really, it is a 
lot when use to paying no more than $5 for a game that is well known. 
Anyway, after looking at the 4.9 rating, reading the reviews, and just have 
a strong interest in point and click adventure games with good humor I 
decided to give it a try. I am very pleased so far and LMAO! UPDATE: I 
finished the game. Took a break when I felt I was nearing the end and I 
didn't want it to be over. So, the days I spent not playing, I felt good 
knowing I had more to play later. I know. I'm weird. Anyway, I was sad when 
I finished because it was over. Don't get me wrong, this game is long and 
well worth it's price, but I enjoyed it so much I probably wouldn't have 
been happy it ended even if it was ten times longer. That's how great this 
game is. I really hope the developers make another one soon that's just as 
good and long ( or longer) than this one. By far, the best retro point and 
click game I have ever played. From the humor, to the puzzles, the story, 
the layout, and being able to follow the lives of and complete specific

Loved the feel, art, story, humor, puzzles (they nailed the puzzles, IMO), everything.  The only downside I had at all (which is more if an observation than complaint) is the Teen rating content, which will keep me from sharing it with my 6 and 5 year olds. One character is crude as a character trait, but censored. With the censoring it is probably fine for 12 or 13 year olds, but still a bit too much for 6.
