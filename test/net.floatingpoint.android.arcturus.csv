I do like this frontend, quite a bit, but there are a few reasons I'm not using it any more, using DIG instead: 1.) The reliance on controller support to the detriment of using it via just the touchpad. This is a requirement for me now that I'm on a tablet rather than my old GPD XD. 2.) Visually, you can't do as much as you can with DIG. I like each system having its own screen with its own wallpaper and music track. You also get more icon layout options with DIG. 3.) All scanned images are contained in a not-so-easy to access format, that, when you have enough images, can increase instability with the application. Using your own images can help with this. With those aside, I will say that this is likely the better emulator for support - you can choose what file types to include and ignore, and create custom systems if you so choose. I heartily recommend this frontend, especially to those who exclusively use controllers.",5,9,1.21.3,2020-04-23 12:16:10,,

Perhaps also use these resized thumbnails in the oreo channels as well since the issue persists there.  2) Improve the loading screen. Just showing the box art in full screen for x amount of seconds looks kind of weird. Perhaps look to how Gamestream presents it's loading screen for inspiration. ie smaller box art with blurred background. Adding an progress circle would help as well even if it is arbitrary since it's for a predefined amount of time. It at least gives the sense that something is happening.  3) Allow us to manually select / rearange the artwork/boxart since sometimes the scrapper grabs a less than ideal one.  4) Add a kiosk mode that hides the bottom database/settigs/etc row.

MAME scraping is something we're working on, hopefully we'll find a solution soon.

Picking from installed apps is unfortunately not as easy as it sounds. The way Android works you don't just launch an app with a rom. You specify a bunch of arguments that differ between every app and have to be discovered manually. Hence the templates =)",2015-12-17 23:57:17

I know the icon doesn't suit everyone, but it's actually meant to look a bit pixellated for a more retro feel. I hope you'll forgive that, it's hard to cater to everyone's taste with just one icon =)",2015-11-16 04:13:52

It works well and is easy to set up.  The only thing is that I wish that the game rows didn't take up the whole screen.  Similarly to the Netflix app I think it would look nice if you could see the background art in the upper portion of the screen and have a bit cleaner nav., or at least have the option.  Great work!",4,1,1.6,2015-11-04 09:09:46,"Glad you like it!

An alternative UI, with some info and artwork for the currently selected game in the top half or so of the screen, is already planned. Will take a while to get there, but it'll definitely happen.",2015-11-05 01:52:45

Things I think it really needs are as follows.  *Voice Search *Fast Scroll (a-z) on the side of the grid layout *A better Icon - Material Design guidelines *Colorize the description card with color pulled from artwork *Indexed into the main launcher so games shows up in suggested row. *Index into Google App Search so you can search for games from the home launcher.,4,1,1.5.1,2015-09-27 23:04:22,"Thanks for your comments!

Most of this is already on the roadmap (timeframe unknown). Adaptive color for the description card seems nice, adding that aswell.

Recently played games should already show up in the recommendations row. Last four games I believe.

I decided to give Arc Browser a shot after hearing about it in one of Nvidia's forums, and the fact that the latest Gamesome build introduced some bugs.  It turns out that  Arc Browser has more features, flexibility, and customizations than Gamesome.  The presentation of my games looks better and fancier (which is a big plus for me).  I also have the option of having all my emulators accessible on one page if I want to.  It is very impressive and easy to use.  In addition, the developer quickly responds to our suggestions.  Floating Point has done an outstanding job with this and I suspect it will even get better.  Suffice to say that Arc Browser has replaced Gamesome as my new frontend.  It is simply awesome and worth every penny!",5,1,1.3.3,2015-09-07 08:45:18,,
