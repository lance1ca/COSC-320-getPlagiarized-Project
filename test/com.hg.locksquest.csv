No framerate issues, and it's optimized well for a single screen device. My only complaint is the controls work well but I do run into difficulty in using the analog stick efficiently; some fine tuning would bring this up to being nearly flawless. The tower defense-RPG style gameplay has held up so well; It's a hidden gem!",4,28,1.0.357,2019-09-25 23:45:04,,

It's nearly impossible to get from one point to another without catching on a wall, which then makes it hard to get to a wall or tower to repair it. At this point I can't recommend it.",3,18,1.0.357,2019-09-25 22:05:37,,

did you, by any chance, miss that you also have to repair both walls next to the turret too? There are arrows on the elements that you need to interact with. If your issue still persists, please contact our support: support@handy-games.com",2019-09-26 02:01:46
