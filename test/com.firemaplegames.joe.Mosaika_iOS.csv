I enjoyed this one, but THE LOST CITY by Fire Maple is their best and most enjoyable app. The Hidden World required hints, which you often have to wait about 6 mins before being released. THE LOST CITY was different and did not have locked timed hints, although it gave clues. The Hidden World included witch scenes, so that took away from the enjoyment alot. THE LOST CITY was pleasurable, calming and the best mystery game I have ever experienced. Thanks for interesting apps!",4,6,,2020-08-08 07:45:45,,

I feel this game had the same great graphics and great scenery as the other two. Unlike the other two this game's challenges were lacking. I found it to be extremely linear and too easily were all of the puzzles solved quickly. Perhaps this game was designed for a younger audience other than the grizzled veterans of the genre. Keeping that in mind I easily give this game a 4 star because it is still quality.,4,11,1.0.2,2013-11-16 09:27:06,,

The problem was that the puzzles were severely dumbed down. 95% of the time right when I got a new object I knew exactly what I needed to do with it. Part of the problem was you there were only a couple puzzles going on at a time.

The puzzles are much more challenging this time around, and really make you think of your next step - the nice thing about this game is that you have a magnifying glass hint button, so anytime you are stuck, just tap the magnifier, and it tells you the next step - if there is a puzzle involved, you even have the choice of revealing the solution, or waiting to see if you can solve it yourself.
