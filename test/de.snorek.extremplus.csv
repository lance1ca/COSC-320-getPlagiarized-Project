It does what it's supposed to, it vibrates everytime I snore just enough to get me to roll over. The only problem is it vibrates everytime my wife snores also....lol....so I would never get sleep if I kept this on. On goes the endless battle to end snoring.",4,2,1.50,2019-02-02 05:31:07,,

The only problem I have with it is that it only logs 50 snoring events in one sleep period and then stops logging AND also stops signaling my Gear to vibrate after that...This bug MUST het fixed. Thank you.,5,1,1.50,2015-05-13 06:08:00,"Hi Cyrus, thanks for your feedback about Snorek App some time ago.

We have addressed your requests in our last Snorek FREE version. Now you also have all-night-graphics, the App counts the snores and you can save results for the last night. Maybe you'd like to give it a try.

We hope you enjoy our last Snorek App !

Kind regards,
Snorek Team",2016-08-12 07:14:05

Unfortunately it just triggers the gears notification and that's not strong enough to interupt me.  But that's not the apps fault.  Would be nice if there was a test button and the app did not have to run in the foreground.  Still the best snore tracker I've tried so far.,4,0,1.50,2014-10-30 01:32:42,"Hi James, thanks for your feedback for Snorek some time ago.

We have addressed some of your ideas in our last Snorek version that we have just released. Now you also have all-night-graphs, you see your snore noise level and also your inspiration/expiration time. You can choose your warnings from within the App and much more ! We hope you enjoy it!",2016-08-12 07:11:50
