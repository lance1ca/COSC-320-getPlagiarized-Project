Alarm names…   2. Reminder option doesnt have photo…   3. Add more advanced repeat functions example…  every date of a certain month…   4. Lastly how do I export my alarms if I get a new phone?    Otherwise good app!,3,2,1.0,2018-04-06 01:29:01,"Hi Arnold, thanks for your feedback, we are working on version 2. We always care about our users feedback.
