Not this time.  Maybe my habits are unusual but I typically buy to solve a particular problem. So at this point I can only offer my opinion specifically about SuperBeam Pro's video transfer functionality.  My particular ""problem"" was getting 63 videos off my Samsung S6 and onto my computer. I tried a number of approaches and had settled on using simple Bluetooth when the failed transfers and mobility limits (can't wander more than a spitting distance from my computer...), proved too discouraging and finally forced me to ""learn"" something new.  Like: ""What the heck is Wi-Fi Direct?""  After reading just enough about the subject to be dangerous I did what I typically do which is: Go to Google Play, search for try out the highest rated solutions what looks like it might work.  I tried SuperBeam first and HOLY COW was it fast!   e.g.: A 100 MB video via Bluetooth: About 10 minutes. The same video via SuperBeam: less than a minute!  Upgrading to Pro: A 12.6 GB zip of all my videos: 20 +/- minutes!  With these results, why try anything else?  I couldn't be more pleased!  THANKS SuperBeam!",5,0,1.0.1,2017-02-04 10:12:28,,

I just downloaded the lite version, and liked it so much that I bought the PRO version. This helped me a lot, very often I download ROMs to test out on my Nexus 4, but I usually download the ROM to my Nexus 7 instead. Here is how this application has helped me: Instead of finding my phone and downloading it through there, I can just download the file I want, and transfer it WIRELESSLY to my phone. That is amazing!
