I find the AI to be very good and not so easy to beat. On my S8+ game transitions are smooth almost all the time with occasional and very rare stuttering. Music and card sfx are relaxing and thematic. Tutorial is fairly done but I think it's missing some info regarding how's calculated the final score (what are those numbers on red card and blue card next to the score?) *My wishlist* - Stats? Stats! We need stats! - Moar expansion please! :-) - *A campaign mode would be cool as heck!* - Wish there was a chance to see how many Spoil Cards you have in your deck (accrued also while playing the match). - Also, is there any way we can see the main playing area during the ""discard card"" event triggered when playing a card like (for example) Mindful Owl or Pacekeeper Druid?
