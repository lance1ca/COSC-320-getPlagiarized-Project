Little Rock was not working for a few weeks though. Said buffering then stop. All other stations worked but I needed Little Rock. That was why I bought the app and was disappointed. I contacted the developer and its now corrected.,5,0,2.9.1,2013-08-19 20:34:45,,

I'm a storm spotter. Sometimes you don't want to look geeky with to many gadgets on you. And severe weather doesn't care where your at. So to have a live broadcast is very nice. Also has the best tech support.  Thanks Joe,4,0,2.9,2013-06-26 07:10:32,What is the station that is not streaming?,2013-06-25 21:45:37
