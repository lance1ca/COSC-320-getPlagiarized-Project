Also it would be cool if in sandbox instead of fighting bots and placing buildings u have infinite money and u control all the teams and can test units out without putting buildings. Also add more units..maybe add soldiers. What I am saying is that there should be a free play mode in sandbox u can place anything in it and controll all the teams and can make some teams allys with each other would be coo,4,33,1.14,2020-12-12 03:59:55,,

For one the AI will always gang up on the player even if you custom make teams, for example 2v2v2v2 the player will be attacked far more often than their AI teammate regardless of positioning. Also double income only affects AI. Finally, multiplayer has a problem, because there isn't a spectator option you have to hope the host is considerate and chooses a map that will allow everyone in the lobby to play otherwise some people will be forced to watch. [Edit] Thank you for adding spectator mode next update but shouldn't that mean that the host now has to pick a map able to hold everyone that isn't spectating, I mean it only makes sense.

even create your own, then maybe polish the menu and over-all UI because it

Something to show when the data has actually saved would be awesome. Next 
of all there probably need to be more troops or stages of progression in 
the car as it is a pretty big leap from fire mech to experimental spider. 
Also it would be good if map size could be increased to have absolutely 
enormous games. Finally something at the start of the game like a demo to 
use the advanced settings for games would just make the game better.

I've played 4 hour long games against AI letting everything build and if their defences are too strong to bust I enjoy a good nuclear  festival. I've been able to dominate a large map in 20 minutes on hard. There's a website to download mods if interested. I think the developer(s) should focus on another rts with seperate factions as another pointed out. I'd definitely be will to pay $10 or more for that. Keep it retro though.

Add factions: how I would design factions is like rock paper scissors. One unit has an advantage and a disadvantage. Cool looks, 2. Power plants to run your base. That way you can add units with electric weapons, shields, and EMP attack. 3. Radar: see pinged dots on the fog of war. Disabled without power 4. Research and upgrades, like a lab building and unlocking units throughout the skirmish.  5. With the factions comes storyline. Start a story with a conflict and play the different factions. Key characters, cutscenes, and maybe 3d textures and gameplay. This game is the best on mobile on the market.",5,0,1.11,2018-01-10 19:37:49,,

It is a great rts staying true to the roots of genre defining titles such a 'C&C' and 'Supreme Commander'. I have a couple of suggestions though, looking through replays, most of games involve spamming up lots of either hover tanks or gunships (as well as mass amounts of fabricators). This is sad as other units are neglected. To combat this, how about making a second resource in the game like power. You could start of with say, 10 power, this will allow you to build engineers and construct a simple base. To build a army, the player would need to build expensive 'power generators' that increases the total power by X amount. Bigger units such as bombers and gunships could use 2 power units each. Units such as experimental's would cost considerably more, power generators could also have a t2 upgrade to double the output. This would make the player have to think about how they will attack and balance their power at the same time, rather than building mass amount of units and just sending them to a enemy base. Also (to keep the balance) fabricators could also cost a reasonable amount of power, this will prevent people just spamming fabricators and then power generators. I hope you really consider implementing these features as I think it would really improve the multi-player element of the game, thanks for reading.",5,0,,2018-01-04 14:01:09,"I agree some of the balance needs to be changed up to allow other units to be used more. Are you playing on 1.11p3? Hovertanks have been nerfed in that version they still being spammed? Light or heavy hovertanks? I am looking into power, not sure about setting it up like that for the high tier units, people would then likely spam basic units.",2017-09-17 19:59:39

It's not only addicting, it also gives you a feel of strategy.    The A.I in this is well-balanced. When the A.I level is at easy, they tend to get weak. The higher the difficulties, the A.I presents a formidable challenge. It is not to overpowering or underwhelming to the point where you get bored of fighting or rage-quiting .  The replay value is wonderful. You have not just the mission or skirmish,  it also have varieties of game modes which makes this app stand out.   The artstyle is brilliant. The graphics is colorful and attractive that you won't get tired of seeing it. The screen qualities is impressive and well-balanced that it's not too blurry or color distracting.  However, I have a criticism I need to address. There's a lack of picking color options for your player faction. It gets very bored by playing just green. I request that you add option of picking colors for the player faction like red, blue, purple, etc.   Overall, this app is excellent and well-done. Keep up a good work.  P.S.- I heard from one of Youtube video that you're adding bug faction. I request that you add more faction to make the factions more varied.",5,2,1.10,2017-08-28 15:16:54,,

Should be a premium account thingy so you get exclusive stuff like T4 extractors, and cheap fabricators of all upgrades. In the premium should also include faster building.

Controls are good once u get used to pressing the 'unselect all' habitually, otherwise you'll stack up a bunch of buildings with some builders then accidentally cancel them with a movement order or send troops all over the map when you're having a look.,apart from that it's great.,easy to select multiple or individual unit groups and move them around. The enemy could b a bit tougher. They don't build anything that a large swarm of any unit can't overwhelm. In saying that tho they're a fairly intelligent Ai for what you'd expect from this type of game.,they build little outposts and attacking bases everywhere when u let them and constantly hound you with small attacks. I'd like to see the enemy throw some bigger attacks together as it's fun to defend as well as attack on this game. The survival mode compensates for this but there's not much of an attack component to that one...and yeah like an end of game summary would b good like others have said.

Definitely harkens to old C&C games. Ultimately AI pathfinding and the balance between units was an issue (on medium.) I could sit back and build turrets, AA, and never come under real threat. When I wanted to end the round I would build a fleet of helicopters that could decimate whatever stood their way.
