One of the best post apocalyptic game. If you enjoyed fallout 1 and 2 this is the game to your liking. But I have a problem with the ending. After the credit if I click continue the game will just load a previous safe before the end mission. That means I have to do it again. I tried it 3 times and the same result. It's kinda sad you can't see what happens to Karsnoznamenny or the red fighter as the narrator describes. Idk if it's intentional or glitch. Overall nice game.,5,43,1.20.2,2020-12-22 19:58:42,,
