But they said that the reason the phone suddenly and acutely started overheating was the fault of this app, one of the only two apps that I ever paid for.  Although I enjoyed this app, I cannot use it anymore, supposedly, because Sprint told me not to. They, then, instructed me never to download *any* apps from google Play Marketplace, and to never load music on my phone, or stream any content at all.  Right.  Edit: It's not fair to the developer of this app that I gave it one star (I was seeking attention). I gave it the five stars it deserves.
