The main problem is that the game doesn't seem to realize when it's created an unwinnable layout.  If you haven't gotten far enough in the layout, it rebuilds to the same unwinnable layout and there's no way out of the loop short of quitting the game.  Or, if you're farther along in the layout, many times when you choose ""shuffle,"" it simply stays in the exact same unsolvable configuration.  These no-win scenarios are incredibly frustrating.  Personally, I feel the game should be written so that every layout can actually always be solvable.  That would solve both above problems.  I would also like to see the auto restart be eliminated and a choice between restart or reshuffle always available, AND you don't lose a ""life"" if restarting, at least on the easier levels of difficulty.  This is already a very difficult version of Mahjong, all the harder if played on a smartphone's smaller screen with the big layouts, and the above glitches are very discouraging.",4,2,1.1.8,2013-02-06 11:59:42,,

It's colorful, easy to see, and a joy to play on my Acer TAB A500. Multi-touch allows selecting both tiles at once. Since I usually only have time for a quick game, I'd prefer to be able to stay with my selected game size, rather than increasing levels -- or not having to return to the menu to reselect, but it's not bad the way it is. I turned off auto-zoom at first, but I'm beginning to warm up to it. The tile visual options are very handy. I highly recommend this game!",4,0,1.0.9,2011-06-04 10:54:52,,
