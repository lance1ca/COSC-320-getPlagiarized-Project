But Now I've switched to the golfclash notebook App. Which has more features and was developed by 2 of the best players the game has ever seen. What they don't know about GC isn't worth knowing. All this caddie will do is copy the ideas of the real masters of the game who developed the notebook App. If you want to be better than the competition then come up with yourcoen ideas and improvements and don't go on holiday for over 2 months.,2,3,1.4.1,2018-09-09 15:47:36,,
