ORIGINAL REVIEW: You need to subscribe to ""Premium"" and pay monthly or yearly fees to use certain icons or backgrounds despite the fact that this is already a premium version of the free app offered by the same developer. Monthly fees for a few backgrounds and icons. What an absolute joke. There's about a million weather apps on the Play Store, skip right over this one.",1,18,4.6.0.4,2020-06-01 00:17:27,"The premium icons and backgrounds are a small part of the premium package - the important premium functionality is the animated radar and new features coming soon (air quality and more). We believe we are fair to all users, free and paying. If you disagree you can find another app that gives you more that our app, for less",2020-06-01 05:10:49

And this app gave me good reason.(and that reason is why it's only getting three stars.) I searched a good bit for a good widget for a smart watch that would do the time but also allow me to control the background and this was the best for that. Good enough that I paid for it (which is also something kinda rare for me.) But when it's popping up ""please rate our app"" every time I try opening the app (which should be under the developer's control) but then I CAN'T rate it because the ""OK"" or "" no way"" buttons are hidden due to the low screen resolution (which might not be under the developer's control since it may be a layout controlled more by Android itself) then it's rather difficult to even use the app.  I'm able to get rid of the screen via a bluetooth keyboard and then hitting ""enter"" (or maybe ""tab"" and then ""enter"", etc) to trigger the hidden buttons but apps that keep wanting to pop-up the ""please rate me"" are really annoying. And this isn't the first time I had an unviewable dialog box appear in this app (I just don't recall what the other one was for.)",3,10,1.98.05,2019-01-07 13:31:22,,

There are a fair amount of options and the developers are friendly and responsive to emails but for me there are 2 problems holding it back. Firstly the small widget shows 4 days starting tomorrow but does not show today's day for example if it is Monday, it will show Tue Wed Thu Fri. This is not seen as a problem by the developers but for me this is very odd. Hopefully this may be added later. The other problem is the accuracy of the weather. There is currently a thunderstorm outside but it fails to show this in the widget icon. I changed the provider to try each one and none of them show it. I know that whether prediction is not an exact science but I think a thunderstorm should be predicted or at least shown when happening.

(1) It doesn't show the current ""Feels Like"" temperature in the large widget. Showing this number in the current-weather widgets, and not just in the app can be quite important. (2) It is not possible to show both hourly and daily forecasts in separate rows in the same large widget, although at least it is possible to show them in separate widgets which is okay. I need to be able to see them together in a widget and without having to tap anything. Compare with the Weather Live app, for example, which does show both in a single widget. (3) In a 1 row widget, it doesn't show the time at which the data was refreshed, or an icon to manually refresh it. Tapping on it just opens up the app. I don't necessarily want to refresh it if it has already been recently updated. Compare with the Weather & Clock Widget app, for example, which does show the update time as well as a refresh-icon in its widgets.",2,1,0.91.01.12,2016-08-29 11:22:31,"Thank you for the feedback Amit.
