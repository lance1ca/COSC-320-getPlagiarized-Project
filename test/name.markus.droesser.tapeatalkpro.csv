I can run it in the background while doing other things in my phone without it silently stopping. The only time it gives up is when I'm hammering my phone with heavy apps like Firefox and Google Maps at the same time. Other recorders I've used silently stop recording with much less provocation.  My only gripes with this app is that it does not have any quality options in between WAV and 3GP. 3GP is horribly low quality and WAV is costing me a lot in terms of storage space. The ability to record directly to a high-quality format like Opus would be very welcome. And please respect my phone’s rotation setting. When I select “auto” for the orientation setting, I mean to have it behave like other apps and not rotate unless the phone is also set to “auto.”",4,7,1.2c,2018-04-12 06:23:01,"Hi Kevin, first of all, thanks for the detailed review, highly appreciated!
