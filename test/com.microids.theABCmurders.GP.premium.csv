I'm a big fan of the point & click adventure genre but I did not enjoy this game at all. So much of this game is reading unskippable text or waiting for the scene to slowly fade out or in or for Poirot to gaze at himself in a mirror. You do the same lame letter puzzle 4 times. There are only a handful of real puzzles and some of them have frustrating clunky controls. This is really a game of tapping the screen and waiting more than anything else.

The mechanics are interesting. The graphics are very nice, particularly the way the rendered characters move around. Faces are decent, though a few of the females look alike. The one odd issue with graphics is that some bitmap textures in the game are very low-res and blurry. These are maps or things that you zoom in on, so you can't gloss over them. Good voice acting. There are a few bits that feel like busywork (compare letters again?). I liked the game overall. A bit pricey.",4,28,,2019-01-29 22:51:15,,
