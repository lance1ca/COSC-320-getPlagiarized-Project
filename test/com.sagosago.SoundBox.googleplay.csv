That said this game plays better on a phone than on a tablet. This game isn't as intricate as some of sagos other games.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by fairy tales, babies, any music box. I would pay .99 for this but not 2.99.",4,21,,2016-11-18 08:26:18,,

She's autistic and played this game with her speech therapist. It does a great job teaching her cause and effect, also she's doing well taking turns.",5,51,1.0,2015-07-09 10:37:19,That's wonderful to hear! Thanks for sharing your story. :),2015-09-16 07:45:46
