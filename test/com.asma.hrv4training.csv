Most recently I realise data import from Strava for some dates seems to repeated and occasionally lossy, so the training load analysis chart is unstable, and changes dramatically if I go back and re-import data for specific dates. It is as if some code path pulls from Strava but ignores certain activities. HRV trends commentary currently seems inconsistent with respect to some graphs (eg my training load appears to be increasing week over week, but always shows as ""decreasing"") or at least not documented. The new lactate threshold feature looks interesting but there is no simple explanation of what each of the three different figures mean, only a link to a long blog post.

""You got 8.4 recovery points"". Ok?? Out of 10? 100? What am I supposed to do with that? Call 911? Run a second marathon? What even went into that analysis? Reading through the website is helpful but the app does a poor job connecting the concepts back to even that.

Now HRV4 training can't pair with it and shuts down. (The HR strap works well with Polar's app). HRV4  promises great functionality, but so far none of it works for me.  Update: after some friendly correspondence with developers leaving GPS on has allowed app to pair consistently.  Integrates much, but not all (TSS would be good), Training Peaks data for me.  Will take a few weeks to make use of trends.",4,4,1.1.0,2017-04-09 11:45:53,"hi Andrew, sorry to hear about the trouble you've had with the app. Would you mind emailing us with more details on the issues you had with the Polar sensor?

The only quirk is that when connecting Suunto Bluetooth sensor you need to have location services on as well (remembered that it was the case in other apps, but still took me 10mins to remember that).
