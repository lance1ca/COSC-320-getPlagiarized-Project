It also calculates speed & accuracy. It allows to compete with others in the house to give us incentive to improve. The audio & visuals in the app are very thoughtful, enjoyable & superb just like the rest of the App. Both the free & paid versions are superb for adults or kids learning touch typing as beginners or advanced typists improving speed. So far I haven't seen numbers row typing yet; but still the App is superb - I recommend this for all",5,3,3.1,2021-01-16 21:33:24,,

Getting the full version will surely fine tune her typing skills at her age. She also loves to see her score at the end of each lesson, it motivates her to do better next time. Thanks very much Corentine for this great App!",5,2,3.1,2020-06-12 12:39:43,,
