My main problem with ui is that I need to always select a track every time I get back on track. Why can't it just default to the last track of the day? How many people do drive more than a track a day? If gps is so bad that my times won't be recorded it would be nice to know so in advance, or at the very least after I finished my session. The idea of a session is nice, but these things are called track days... It would be nice to be able to group, compare and export data by event.

A few observations: - proper external GPS is a must, otherwise the quality of GPS data is not accurate enough. Phone's internal GPS may work on tracks which are flat, but not at the Ring. - Telephone's internal video is amazingly good.

I'm glad the Android version is as good as the old Symbian one, and now with video! :) The UI really takes advantage of the better horsepower and touchscreens on the new devices to make this an excellent laptimer.

I still have my old Symbian version for those but would be great if they could be added on to the RCP to make the program complete.",5,2,3.03,2014-05-28 23:55:41,"Before performance measurements I have some video and lap timing related features to do, but it is not forgotten!
