Download or preferably print the manual, three-hole-punch it, and put it in a binder labeled ""Bomb Defusal Manual"" for some fun conversations with friends and family!  It can sometimes be an exercise in frustration, but that's part of the appeal of this game. The gameplay is timed and you're forced to accept defusal advice from someone who can't see the bomb, which encourages sharp communication. This creates a very tense gameplay experience that is super rewarding when you pull it off as a team (or a group). Seriously, bring this to a party with multiple manuals and everyone can join in on the fun.  There are enough difficulty adjustments to keep it interesting no matter how much you've played it and it's only $10! It's $15 on Steam right now for the same game.

It's a great party game and the puzzles can be very challenging.  A quite unique idea for a game and it's well executed.  I think the game is just as fun in either role as the diffuser or expert.  Definitely worth the price.,5,5,1.2.8,2016-12-14 12:38:45,,

It is easily the best game on Daydream VR right now if you happen to have a buddy to play it with. The simple yet genius game mechanics work extraordinarily well and have you engage in frantic conversations with your bomb expert in the real world in no time. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is simply fantastic and should not be missed by any Daydreamer.
