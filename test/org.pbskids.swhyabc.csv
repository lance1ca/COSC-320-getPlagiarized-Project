In addition there is a map that you decorate with the souvenirs you earn by doing the activities.  My 3 year old (almost 4) says she likes this app, but I personally think there are a few tweaks that would make it better/easier for a toddler. It doesn't really teach reading, at least not in an effective way, so in this regard it could be better.

It covers recognizing the alphabet, the sounds the letters make, the alphabet, and the motions needed to draw the letters.  These are all things I want my kids to get assistance with from this app, and it does that well with assistance from their favorite super why characters  I really like that the app doesn't have advertisements (horrible for kids due to them getting tricked, bad websites etc).  I expect no ads from a paid app anyway, so that isn't all that special.  Now some issues/complaints:  - the first time you run the app it spends a lot of time downloading additional content.  It took about 3x as long to download this additional content as to download the asp itself, so based on your connection this could be significant.  - in the alpha pig game, you can press each of the letters before he has explained which letter you're looking for.  My 2.5 year old just mashes all the letters early and eventually gets it right.   Something should change, maybe do not allow answers until he has said the letter you're looking for.  - in the princess mini game the movement is clunky and letters can get behind the word you're on",4,69,1.0,2013-04-08 19:49:56,,
