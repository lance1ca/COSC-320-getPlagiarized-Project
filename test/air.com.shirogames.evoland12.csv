You save before the final puzzle but then the boss is on the other side of the dungeon through all the traps and mobs so if you die you have to wade through it all again. Generally getting to the boss with next to no health where he kills you pretty handily. Honestly I wanted a relaxed bit of rpg fun but feels more like dark souls.,2,167,1.6.8,2018-10-31 15:18:04,,

dev was next tome while I played this, I would end up hitting him. I have 
never been so completely frustrated in a game before, there was so little 
play testing done here. The lava pitfall mazes are not designed for touch 
controls. What they should do is trigger a lot earlier since you can't fix 
the issues with the lack of stiffness or feedback you would get in a 
typical joystick. In fact, a majority of the enviremental hazard puzzles 
are flawed heavily due to the lack of a physical control scheme. The Diablo 
section has no means to switch characters after you switch, the combos are 
far too random with their execution or are flawed due to the touch screen, 
again, and the enemies swarm far too much with health that drops far too 
rarely. The random enemy encounters are also far too high. Especially when 
you are reduced to a single character and go back to find stars and cards. 
The inability to fly over mountains is also a major hinderence to end game 
enjoyment. I can't recommend this game to anyone. Which is a shame as i was 
looking forward to the sequel.",2,0,1.6.8,2018-07-25 01:01:16,,

hit by monsters, the screen spazzes like it's having a seizure, and my

three hours and discovered 89.4% of it. It has cute graphics and the 
concept is really cool which is why I purchased it in the first place. 
What's not so cool about it is the many frustrating inconsistencies 
throughout its short play time. For being as short as it is, it's slow. The 
character literally walks through the game and finally runs when it's all 
but over. The sword dynamics pale in comparison to the girl characters 
staff actions even through they should be 100% the same because they play 
that way, sometimes. There's a lot of elements that are so half implemented 
they shouldn't be included. Such as finding gold and health as the girl 
character but never seeing that collection style again as the male, for no 
reason. Or giving the player the decision of which character to use only 
one time in the game. The in game map appears sometimes but not others. 
There's so many seemingly simple issues that should have been resolved in 
this game that I can't give it a recommendation. It's easy but between the 
sloppy controls, half baked elements and slow meandering pace I wish I 
never purchased it but still saw it through to the end. Very intriguing

another app did anything. Some of the hidden stuff is almost unfindable and 
the game actually gets worse graphically with time. It starts out with a 
retro Legend of Zelda-ish display but withing about 10 mins you'll unlock 
all the visual upgrades and have your end game display which is dire. The 
fixed camera in the final town is a nightmare. The switching between 
past/future makes no sense and is dull. The game would make more sense if 
you switched between two different perspectives. The combat is really, 
really easy and rather than have a mish mash of different styles you have 
overland and dungeon styles which are dull and unchanging. The final boss 
then makes absolutely no use of either of these combat types in the final 
fight so don't bother levelling at all. The 'card' mechanic is a waste of 
time as well seeing as there is only one guy to play cards with and the 
only stake is a possible achievement for beating him. And, unless you go 
through the achievements beforehand you'll never get them. One is to end a 
boss fight on full health but you only ever get to fight that boss once, 
the first time. Imagine my surprise when at the end I went to mop up 
achievements and that was undoable without a whole new game. Doesn't have 
ads though which is nice but I still wouldn't recommend. It paints itself

The mechanic of introducing gameplay concepts as the game progresses could be neat, but because it's more concerned with making smarmy, tongue in cheek references, a lot of the time the changes are entirely cosmetic, despite claiming to be otherwise. For example, when ""storyline"" is unlocked, it's just a quick block of throwaway text that is never referenced again. The one level where switching between modern and early gameplay never actually utilizes mechanical differences, but relies on blocks which are only raised in one mode or the other. The changing mechanics never interact, so instead of feeling like a ""dynamic gameplay"" game it's basically a series of disconnected mini-games that each reference a different classic RPG/adventure game.",2,13,1.2.14,2015-05-30 23:25:24,,

No doubt about that, and the nostalgic way it runs through the adventure genre of gaming is a walk down memory lane for older gamers. However, I feel as though the developers haven't quite worked out what they're doing with this idea, like they had a meeting and decided 'hey, let's do a game that goes through the entire RPG genre from 2d sidescroller to modern day graphics in one' and everyone said 'yeah, awesome', but they then didn't put any effort into a story, or a reason for it to be like this, so it sort of falls down in the story-telling, progressing with the characters side of things. I hope that they do a second one and develop the story ideas, characters, etc. more.",4,3,1.2.14,2015-03-31 12:03:10,,

I mean it's fun to see the graphics and sound start out from nothing and advance as you go but the concept isn't really worked into the game and you're just handed these upgrades by opening chests as you go. You 'earn' other core stuff like the ability to talk to people or open doors etc which is something DLC Quest did in a massively better way so you'd be better playing that instead (and if you haven't you really should as it's excellent). Also it starts off being so easy as to barely be a game then suddenly ramps up the difficulty to ludicrous proportions at the end of one of the dungeons so it's far from the smoothest experience. The worst thing though is probably the controls which represent the worst implementation of an on-screen joystick that I think I've ever experienced and you'll spend a lot of the time wanting to hurl your phone through the nearest window. That all sounds very negative and I didn't hate it but please for the love of all that's holy make the movement control dynamic (or at least let us changes where on screen it sits).,2,0,1.2.11,2015-02-04 05:48:23,"We have improved the controls, please update to latest version and update your review to tell us what you think about it ;)",2015-02-05 08:16:38
