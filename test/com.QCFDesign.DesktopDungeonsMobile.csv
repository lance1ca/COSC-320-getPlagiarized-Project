The tutorial levels pace the early game perfectly, never leaving you feeling overwhelmed despite the variety of things going on and choices to make. Each dungeon is its own puzzle that you must figure out with trial and error. It is also very much worth putting your ear buds in to enjoy the fantastic soundtrack. If you didn't play it on PC, you need to play it now.",5,1,5,2015-05-28 16:31:29,,
