And yes, even compared to the original DS version The original was prone to occasional lag and jutter, and of course DIDN'T have HD sprites: this one has no such slowdowns, is smooth as butter and looks great... save perhaps when in 'investigation mode', but that's a minor qualm.   Aside from that, the only other thing I feel called upon to say is that if you've never played an Ace Attorney and are looking for one to start with, this is as good as one as any to start with.
