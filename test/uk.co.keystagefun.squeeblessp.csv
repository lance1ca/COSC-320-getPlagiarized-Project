My daughter takes some time to type each word not being used to a qwerty keyboard, I'd prefer for her to be able to write the word rather than type it so would like to see either an option to use Android keyboard which can then be switched to handwriting input or a similar in-game method. Alternatively, how about a scrollable A-Z keyboard which would also help develop the child's alphabet learning. A time limit for each word would be a good idea.

The developer updated the app. First class developer.   This app is fantastic in many ways, however it fails in one very important way. When a spelling is incorrect the correct spelling is shown alongside a button to continue. I have noticed that this button is just pressed immediately, giving no time for learning the correct spelling. This leads to reinforcing the incorrect spelling - which is the last thing we want!  This could be solved by having the child enter the correct spelling with the word visible and playing a negative sound when an incorrect character is pressed and a positive sound when it is correct. Only showing the proceed button once it has been entered.  This could be an option in the player settings if needed.  I hope you will consider adding something along these lines.

One thing I would like to see is a word jumble option for practice. One app I had on iOS had that and I found that useful for introducing the words before moving forward to the ""test""  practice.",5,1,1.0,2013-01-14 07:24:53,,

They WANT to learn spellings in order to earn stars and squeebles to then play the squeeberang game after finishing the test. I love the fact that I can choose the words, record the word and decide how long they get to see the word. The only improvement I can think of is to change the name- I hate the word test! How about Spelling Fun instead?",5,3,1.0,2012-12-29 11:20:44,,
