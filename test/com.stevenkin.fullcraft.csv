I turned my phone off and on and that seemed to fix it yesterday. Today it is doing the same. I have sent an email with no response yet. I also feel I should be able to download the ad free version onto my chromebook since it is under the same account. I hope to hear of a solution soon.,3,294,1.0.002,2020-11-02 08:07:01,,
