Once you came out of it's learning curve, you'll find that this game; much like The Last Remnant; is one of the best turn-based tactical RPG. Such depth in character building! And it's in-game tips and information is definitely useful, you don't need any kind of external FAQs or guide, it's all in here. It's battle oriented, so if that kind of game is your cup of tea, I suggest giving this one a try.",5,1,1.0.0,2021-01-28 08:21:20,,
