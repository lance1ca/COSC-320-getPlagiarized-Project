No thrill or extra pricy none sense. Just what need for a Rabbitry records and births. Get away form Hutch over priced greedy software. To have unlimited rabbits under Hutch it's 191.88 a year. Only thing I like to see is easier way to add pedigree. Other then that it's a beautiful app and wonderfully priced!,4,0,3.10,2021-02-09 09:47:02,,

As of right now, the only problem I have is that there is no DOB on the pedigree for the previous generations of rabbits. Also, it would be nice to have a feature that keeps track of income and expenses. Update: Great app. I really like how the developer responds to feedback to improve the app.",5,1,3.10,2021-01-15 07:57:11,Thank you for your feed back. Including DOB on all generations of the pedigree is available now. In the settings screen of the app there is an option to turn that on.,2021-01-15 02:51:49

It doesnâ€™t allow both to be selected because if the rabbit is showable as a broken, then itâ€™s usually considered a broken thatâ€™s a Vienna carrier (VC) rather than a Vienna marked. Broken and VC can both be selected. % of each breed is something I never thought of. I can add that to my list of things to look into.",2021-01-15 02:48:32

On the add/edit rabbit page there is a multi-line text box for notes where you can put any miscellaneous notes that you want to keep like that. Pictures and income/expenses is something others have asked about that I will probably look into at some point later after finishing some other functionality.,2020-09-24 09:45:57

It doesnâ€™t have anything like that because all of your data is local on your device. So thereâ€™s nothing to sign in to. I may look into backup and restore functionality like the iOS version has at some point. But Google backup works for now and thereâ€™s some other things I want to tackle first.,2020-05-08 04:41:32

I think family sharing just refers to sharing the purchase so you donâ€™t both have to buy the app. All the data is local on your device so there isnâ€™t currently a way to share data between users.
