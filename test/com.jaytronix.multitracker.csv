In Windows-land I use Presonus Studio One and Reaper, and am used to complicated settings and the beauty of J4T is how simple and foolproof it is. I wonder out loud to suggest to developer to have the latency check as the first thing that shows up on a new device, because it's incredibly sad to see the recent review where its called junk, yet it's SO easy to set the latency properly. I've had a blast recording acoustic guitar with headphones into my Android phone. The quality has been better than I expected once I bring the files into my computer's DAW. I also beta test for one of the best audio noise reduction suites and thought this would be a lot noisier than it is. But with a headphones, closed ear buds the other tracks won't bleed into the main one. If I find faults they're noting really. The left arrow to get to the settings screen is always close to the fader and screws it up, but that's minor. And like others here I wonder what the metronome could do as well. I love the idea of recording the metronome to one track, because that would make it a LOT easier to sync this once you brought it back to a major DAW to work around. My favorite Android is a $9.99 Best Buy Huawei with no SIM in my area and the microphone CAN sound pretty good! Experiment!

It could be that the device is doing work in the background like updating, syncing etc, which interferes with the recording.

They seem to take too much device memory. But it doesn't bother me since the original track can be relatively good quality.      One suggestion to JT4 users:  if you create lots of files, export them to MP3 as you make them!   (not once a year like I am currently trying to do... a major time-sucker!)

It's awesome! It's like having a basic version of adobe audition, or pro tools in your pocket, ready to record any musical ideas that come to mind. I really dig how you can edit any track and zoom way in to get start/stop points for looping perfect, and how you can tweak the effects during playback realtime, and how you can offset the tracks in time to compensate for any latency that may occur, (i have a very old smartphone and J4T still works great!) Keep up the great work!!! :-)   P.S. It would be super groovy if you could create some plugins or additional effects that J4T could use. Maybe microphone, amp, and/or speaker cab modeling/emulation. Also, maybe add options to the existing editing effects, (like different curves for fading in or out instead of just a linear curve).

I also have latency issues due to a limited device (Galaxy ace GT-S5830), but they're really easy to address. Simply drag to an easily identifiable location, go to 'sync' and either manually drag the wave forms or nudge into place.
