You can get the game and this expansion for under $5 - can't really complain.  So many games similar to this are free to play, but just push micro-transactions to actually play the game.    This is more-or-less the same game that was released in 2000, so it's completely possible to play without spending any more money after the initial purchase price.

You miss out on the two extra spell sets and all you get is a melee scout that's kind of mediocre compared to the paladins and disciples. Maybe allocate some of the buff spells like invisibility to that. The tier 3 spell for the necromancer temple is basically just a weaker version of revive that costs more to cast.

However the game has a lot of potential and it needs an update for balance and gameplay. This game is all about building choices and there's really only one good option out of the already limited selection (healers and paladins.) Any other variation is more frustrating than interesting. Castors are so weak they usually just die immediately. There needs to be stronger combinations of heroes to play with. The mission types are basically all the same ...defeat all the baddies. How about some different modes like survival. Would love to see some updates.,3,9,1.5.23,2015-10-07 22:32:02,"Brennan, thanks a lot for your feedback. We appreciate your ideas and will keep them in mind. However, as for all mission types being the same, the point of the whole game is to protect your kingdom and to defeat monsters, so it's quite natural that all missions will be about killing all the baddies in different variations :)",2015-10-20 08:57:44
