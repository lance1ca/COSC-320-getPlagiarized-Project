Please show the maintenance dock when probing or mining.     Create a 'Sanity' meter that will increase and decrease based on log entries and increase when the player encounters life on a planet.     Create a 'Fabricator' which uses 1 omega to produce a preset unchangeable amount of an element on board.     Create NPCs which act like another player. The player can orbit a planet it is orbiting and hail them. After hailing, a screen much like when the player orbits an abandoned ship will show, adding a 'Trade' dock and showing cargo automatically. If trade is agreed upon then the player and NPC places the elements in the trade dock and confirms trade, which moves the elements from the NPC's trade dock into the players cargo.     A multiplayer mode in which the other players are treated much the same as NPCs. The players orbits the same planet, hails and waits for the other player to accept or decline. When accepted they move to the trade screen but a chat system is added. Players agree on trade, place elements in trade dock and confirm.

The art and narrative are top notch, but more than 90% of the content will never be seen by anyone except those with an inordinate amount of time on their hands. Watching LPs completely spoils discovering the otherwise brilliant allure of the game for yourself, and it really is a shame, given the vast potential it may have otherwise had...and there isn't anything else like it in terms of design. FTL doesn't count at all. Failing literally within the starting system over and over before you get the hang of the fact that there really is only one way to success leaves a bitter taste that ruins the captivating effect the rest game has, and the fun of it is eclipsed by this. Eventually succeeding doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment - you feel like you've been through a frustrating ordeal and with the sudden ending, there's zero reward or replayability. Too bad I can't recommend this at all. I really, really wanted to.  Would be much better with a companion comic or animated miniseries...maybe then it would emerge from its unfortunate obscurity.

HE gives you more fuel than H - keep that in mind. 2. Switch ships often where it makes sense. Be aware that not all ships use HE and H for fuel. 3. The Omega element you receive from aliens can be applied to any repair or category of resource.   Great game.

It resembles FTL with a rogue-like space theme, but lacks the depth FTL possesses with decision trees concerning crew/salvage/systems management. Lacking crew management at all, where salvage or systems management is concerned the player has a little control but to roll the dice on whatever actions they can take and hope for the best. After a game of FTL you can recall certain decisions you made that potentially cost you the game, but Out There really just leaves you saying ""better luck next time"" that's really unsatisfying (""I have no way of knowing, so I'll just hope this system I'm travelling to has a planet with fuel, and that the planet is worth mining. No? Game over - oh well, guess I'll repeat this until the stars line up"").   Tl;dr don't play if you're not a fan of games based on a lot of luck.

You visit a system, visit a planet, and harvest. Rinse repeat and hope you can get enough fuel, oxygen, and iron at each stop to maintain your ship.  Other than that there's not much strategy or choice. The game is ""hard"" in the sense that it's rare you find enough stuff along the way to keep you going.

You can't use skill to work your way through these mishaps. If you don't get the good luck, you fail.

I love the concept AND the execution, but I think it's clear from many of the reviews that it's not something a lot of people are really expecting right now.  This is a tough game, and once you play through a few times it's clear there's a limited amount of non-randomly-generated material that becomes a little repetitive, but in my opinion that's not a big deal. I do appreciate the quality, humor, and insight that went into the written work, but it does kind of put the game in a difficult middle ground between a pure random dungeon and a graphic novel.  Overall I'm impressed with, happy with, and inspired (as a developer) by this game. I'm glad I spent the cash on it, but I'm conceding a star simply because it does stumble a bit by pushing a very limited amount of custom scenario in an otherwise randomly-generated environment.",4,0,1.04.4,2015-01-03 04:44:31,,

(Example: you need technology to upgrade your equipment but you have no way to influence what you get, if you get anything at all.  Land on a mineral planet and you might get a tech.  Probably won't.  The depth of the game is choosing to land on the rocky planet or not.)  Overall, the quality of the game is good, though it could use some UI improvements like zoom-able map.

On the gaming side, the mechanics are not very complex but understanding how to survive truly is a challenge. I confess I don't really appreciate the whole roguelike philosophy of being too cool for savepoints, and would have probably given up without a little savescumming; if you quit and restart, everthing you did in the solar system you're currently on is not saved, which helps get to the sweet spot where it's not excessively frustrating while still instilling the fear of losing.

The visuals were also rather stunning.  On the depth of the gameplay:  The alien language mechanics were intereasting enough. I soon found out that just by looking at he basic structure of the sentences, you could figure out what was being said with just 1 or 2 words.   ""A is B A hate C X is love/hate C?""   This isn't the best example but most of the language is in a very basic sentence and just by identifying what words repeat you can guess the structure.

You have very limited space which shrinks with every new system installed. So the game ultimately boils down to luck. I would like it much more if it required more skill and relied less on random elements. Can't wait to get FTL on Android. It's definitely a superior game.

The best thing about the game is the writing: it's varied, interesting, and (other than the occasional typo) well constructed. Most of the special events fit the setting well and produce a sense of mystery and wonder. It's a shame that you'll hardly ever see them in the sea of generic ""you lost/gained x amount of fuel/oxygen/hull"" events that make up the majority of random events, of which there is very little variation.  Planet exploration is similarly mundane and repetitive. There are only three kinds of planets and there is almost no variation. Rocky planets offer minerals and a random chance to find a technology. All gas giants are the same and offer no variety, but you'll be seeing them constantly because the game uses fuel usage as its primary method for forcing restarts. If you were hoping to focus on exploration and alien contact, don't bother. The majority of your time will go to trying to keep your fuel levels high enough.  Alien interactions are just as shallow. There's no diplomacy or branching dialogue or even differences between language/culture across species. Every alien speaks the same language and follows one of two speech patterns and gives you the same item if you answer two questions correctly. The questions are as repetitive as the rest of the game, but hidden behind the language mechanic.  Save the $4 and buy a classic sci fi book. The gameplay is nearly nonexistent and the writing isn't good enough or frequent enough to make up for the game's many faults.",2,3,1.01,2014-03-10 06:52:08,The update should fix this issue,2014-03-18 04:06:56

Limited cargo space is one of the fundamental parts of the game, but its very annoying to be low on fuel and not be able to dump all of that mined resource directly into your ship without tossing half your other supplies overboard. I would even be okay with it if you could only apply 'on ship' resources to systems, so you throw away one resource and then drag new ones on to the ship, then on to the system and repeat.

Every action has a consequence and resource usage must be carefully calculated.  Both the sense of loneliness and the sensation of being the alien in a strange new area of space are brilliantly realized. Well done Mi-Clos.,5,4,1.01,2014-02-27 08:46:36,,

I haven't gotten much reward out of playing so far. Trial and error and replay are very much the order of the day with this title. Excellent atmosphere. Not nearly as much of a micromanage sim as FTL. A step in the right direction for space rogue-likes.,4,0,1.01,2014-02-27 08:38:27,,
