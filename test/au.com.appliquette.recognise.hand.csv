On some tests I'm going very slow and double checking and still sometimes get 90%. The memory game is also slightly buggy in that you can sometimes get 3 or more tiles flipped at once (which shouldn't be possible). I'm still skeptical of the overall science here. I've also ordered one of the workbooks to go along with the app. Hopefully it describes more about the exercises (how long to do, how often, etc). Will update my review after using more.",3,8,1.0.6,2020-08-26 21:09:18,,

The app also suffers from other functionality bugs too. Overall a disappointing and frustrating experience. Update: Since the Dec 18 update it now crashes in results/options section.
