Nothing else touches it... I have learned the intricacies of the game and my tactics would still be flawed if I hadn't been using this version. Level 5 uses flawless mathematical tactics (aside from when bearing off for some strange reason) so sometimes it's obvious you're playing a machine... But I wouldn't still be playing the same machine 10 years later if the AI didn't allow me to recognise some neat tactical tricks,5,9,2.292,2019-09-25 14:55:11,,

second review posted. Like many of the reviews up here proclaiming that the 
CPU cheats, I had a red hot flame review up here too. I was absolutely 
convinced this app was unfairly pounding me with doubles, and eerily 
hitting my open unprotected pieces. But I also own and am very pleased with 
a lot of AI factory games too. I think they are all good, attractive and 
challenging games so I wondered why is this game different? I also took 
note that AI Factory took the time to answer most of the reviews, something 
you don't always see from game makers. So I thought I would start over, 
reset my statistics, and take a look at this in a focused way, instead of 
just right after I lost a game. I began writing down individual end of 
round statistics plus over all accumulated stats and I was surprised. I 
often had more doubles given to me than were played against me. Not always 
but enough to raise an eyebrow. And there were also many games where I had 
a higher dice count than the CPU did. Again not always but enough to make 
me come to the conclusion that this probably is a number generator that is 
indeed random. Yes, the CPU still gets me bad sometimes. But cheating? 
Thats my game ego yapping. The same doubles happened against the CPU too. 
Deep down I don't think the CPU cheats. Sometimes I just lose. And by the 
way, I wondered 'what does a gamemaker stand to gain by rigging the game in 
the game's favor anyway'? No one is playing the CPU for money. If you think 
about it, they want more game sales, or ad views - not returns and 
complaints. If anything, they would rig the game so that players would win 
more than lose. Then the reviews would be ""this is the greatest game ever"", 
or ""it's boring, too easy"". So I took down my negative review and I'm going 
with this one. I like and am at peace with the game.",5,4,2.27,2018-06-24 04:15:38,,

Levels 1 to 3 seem to play normally, but the fix starts to creep in at Level 4. Level 5 is blatantly fixed (12 CPU doubles to no Player doubles) just does not happen in the real world. And I've been playing for over 40 years.  And, I've discovered that on Level 5, if the Player immediately offers the doubling cube on his/her first or second roll, it calms the CPU's incessant perfect rolls and doubles.

So if it looks like I am going to be gammoned, I avoid being back gammoned by never using auto bear off until I have cleared all of my checkers from the opponent's inner board.

The cpu will roll every single number it needs (including several consecutive doubles) once a double cube request is accepted. (You lose if you decline). Such a shame as i like a good game of backgammon. This ruins what could have been an almost perfect version of the game.

Firstly, after finishing your move, the AI immediately takes over - yes, you can undo, but there should be a chance to reconsider before allowing the AI to move immediately. Other games ask you to roll the AI's dice to indicate you have finished. Second, there is no way to autoplay - so when if you are stuck on the bar and can't get back on, other games allow the AI to take over completely and save you wasting your time. Third, the AI never offers to resign, so each game has to be played to the bitter end even when it is obvious that you have won.   The final problem is that the AI is not very clever. I am not a great player by any means, but on maximum difficulty I can beat it in match after match.
