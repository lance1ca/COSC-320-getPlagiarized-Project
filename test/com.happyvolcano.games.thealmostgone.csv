Controls for moving and turning the rooms were a bit wonky; sometimes a room would turn when I didn't mean for it to, or I'd move to a room I didn't mean to. But overall it was incredible to follow Emily's journey. I kinda wish I knew what had happened to her, but the downfall of her parents marriage and her mother's mental health was terribly sad. Lovely game, thank you.",5,3,,2020-06-25 11:56:21,,
