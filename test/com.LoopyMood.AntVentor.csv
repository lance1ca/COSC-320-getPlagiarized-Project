But not good for mobile devices items you need are missing such as the spider web to make the bow ect..,3,3,1.0.6,2018-11-15 18:43:08,"Hi! Regarding the ""missing"" spider web. I guess you are watching YouTube videos with a walkthrough. They are recorded from PC very early version. In later versions we have changed the time when spider web will appear. Use hints in the game. Spider web is NOT missing. It will appear later. 
Please check it and change you review.",2018-11-16 10:30:11
