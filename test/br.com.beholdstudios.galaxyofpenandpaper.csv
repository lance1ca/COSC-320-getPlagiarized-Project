I have a entire character to just buff it on as many enemies as possible. Effectively paralyze them. They keep hitting each other and die.

The combat work mostly the same as it always has but the new skill system is lacking. Instead of having 4 abilities you level up there's a huge list to pick from but it doesn't matter as 90% of the skills are underwhelming or useless. There is some combos you can pull of with some class combos like debuffing an enemy which causes your attack to do more damage. The ship combat is simple but different enough to be fun and it doesn't happen often enough to become bland. Quest are a big change in this game as it gives you more of a dm feel. You get to decide what planet/questgiver/monster to kill. This has it's ups and downs as you loose story in your side quests but you have more control of them. Last I would have to say the biggest complaint is load times. The game takes way to long from start up to actual play time.,2,12,1.1.1,2018-12-10 12:29:37,,

Compared to the others it's miles ahead in terms of additions. However it is riddled with bugs, much like the last one some objectives are uncompleteable, restarts are neccessary, lots of things appear and vanish when they shouldn't, the bug reporter itself is bugged and a few side missions affect travel by not registering as completed properly. I feel as though it could definitely use some rebalancing as no class really feels like it's annihilating till you get one of those power ups and even then it's still a struggle to put out enough damage. Found myself requiring two tanks, the healer and the best dps I had was the bounty Hunter. The survivability was bar none but fights dragged on which is not really a good thing for how little damage they would do even when I speced out all the way for crit on the hunter. no spoiler the final fight was a bit annoying with how much damage he could do and how little I could heal. I suppose that it's supposed to encourage you to do at least some side missions that way but I feel like progression needs to be tuned where a side mission after every story mission is necessary in order to be able to level up properly as I found side missions largely unnessecary. One last thing I didn't enjoy was the classes themselves. Compared to the last game, despite them being customizable so each class could be played a variety of ways, I found that classes shared a lot of abilities and had too few class specifics. The customization is awesome, a real stroke of genius but I never felt like they fulfilled their fantasy well enough. Each class shared it's, often times, most affective abilities with one other which kind of defeats the purpose of playing anything specifically except for raw stats. I suppose this is to be more akin to an actual tabletop, never played one. The problem however lies in the fact that once you have the exact build down, which shouldn't take you long if you read, you'll only spend around 10 skill points and by level thirty that menu just becomes a hindrance on your way to the items and with the level up screens. The space ship battles...god damn those are supremely hard. Lots of luck which is fine but when I was delving into the space ship side missions they would anniahlate me with more health and more dice which is not luck based. I can't roll higher than a four and you gave them a d8? Dafuq? This has to be tweaked in order to be playable. Spaceship battles in story however were definitely balanced enough to finish them thank goodness otherwise it would've been the equivalent of that minigame syndrome where you have to finish going through hell in order to progress. Gadgets are useful but also largely unnessecary so feel like those could be tweaked a bit more as well. Also this was a problem with the last one but I really want to listen to other things while I play. I often podcast and listen to other music so I can learn as I go so not being able to play anything else in the background on my main media device was annoying. I love the music but too spaced out to be the only thing going on in the background. TLDR; buggy, unbalanced, totally worth it. A ton of gameplay improvements, same charm. Everything that could be improved upon they did, can't wait for the next one, or the dlc, whichever comes first. Edit: seems to not have been updated still for new Android os so it won't start. Edit: problem has been fixed, my fix was to manually go into settings and allow it access to storage as the usual prompt did not appear. Once this was done the game ran super smooth and the ship battles have been rebalanced for the better. It's great.",4,2,1.0.7,2018-11-05 10:06:37,Thank you! :),2018-11-05 11:15:23

I wish they'd produce more content for KoPP instead of rereleasing it with a SciFi skin. UPDATE: Reply appreciated but irrelevant. You're still just releasing a third version of the same game. I appreciate that you didn't make KoPP2 but it is not significantly different from KoPP. I feel for you; GoPP definitely should have been made in place of KoPP2.

Cons Unfortunately the dialogue is the best part of the game. The writing is tiny and not adjustable, and the l9ad times are oddly long for a game that is not resource intensive. The battle is also painfully slow and I keep wishing there was a setting to speed up gameplay.   On the topic of battle, the character classes and the skills seem to have been a complete afterthought. There is very little differentiation between the characters, and the unique skills each class have are lackluster. In the other pen and paper games you were stuck with the same few skills, but at least you could choose which ones to make more powerful, and you could build a team based off the various synergies. None of that exists in this game. They all have a poison skill, and they all seemingly are tanks, because many skills even on lighter classes increase threat. A bunch of classes also have skills that trigger secondary effects when a stun is active on the enemy, however I haven't found a single character or item that has a stun effect! There is also way less customization of the table and gm benefits, and although the map is very open ended, the various hunt/collect etc missions are all the same and get boring super quick.  I'm not done with the game, and there are still 2 classes I haven't tried yet, but honestly feel that I might not play through the end.",2,6,1.0.7,2017-12-07 05:03:31,"Hi, Ross, we have made tons of improvements (performance included) in the game and it's available right now.

I like the idea of space battles, I just feel that maybe some of the characters could gain skills you can use during space battles. The 3d graphics also feel very forced. I was expecting an intensely colorful pixel map of space and I wanted to see how you guys would pull that off. I really hope you can change everything 3d back to pixel art. Everything else is great though, I love the battles and how the limited skill selections force you to properly think your way through a fight.

Never played Knights of Pen and Paper. Best mobile game I've probably ever played (and this is a legit review). For $5 you get a full game, no ads or micro-transactions. The pixel art and music is fantastic, and the story is refreshing and funny. Galaxy of Pen and Paper doesn't shy away from reminding you that you are playing a game within another game, and I loved that. Customizing players roles and abilities to fit your personal play style is nice. If there was a single thing to complain about, it would only be that the load time for booting up the game or quitting back to the main menu takes a few seconds of quiet, nothingness happening on the screen.
