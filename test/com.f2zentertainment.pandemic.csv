I have multiple expansions and have purchased two legacy board games. Playing on mobile gives new ideas on how to play certain characters or how to perform certain actions. Mobile playing sure beats the actual board game in terms of setup. I actually love how I can pick up the app and play the game without having the actual board. However, I am only giving three stars due to: 1. Constant app crashes 2. Lack of online play 3. Bugs - event card not working",3,0,2.2.11-60004336-0e68d742,2021-02-08 21:20:06,,

Yes, the game is supposed to be hard, but it's not supposed to be THAT hard- it's an actual imbalance in the game caused by the OTB expansion, which can be compensated for fairly in real life by simply reshuffling the draw deck- but no such option exists in the app.  Win rates drop below 1%, which isn't what I'd call ""hard"", it's what I'd call a waste of time.  Literally, a waste of time.  It's not fun when you know the game is rigged so heavily against you- there's not a better strategy that can be employed, one can only play hundreds of times with perfect play-style in the hopes that one of those times you will be lucky enough through a combination of starting characters, hands, disease positions, and deck compositions; such that through your extreme luck you finally get to see the victory screen.  I did it, and I can tell you the victory screen is just not that special... it's not worth your time.  As such, I can only give this game 1 star.  If it had options for various house rules (like reshuffling the draw deck as one clear example) I would give it a full 5 stars.  If it had house rule options and the other expansions included like ""In the Lab"" then I would give it 6 stars if I could.  But it doesn't hve these things, so I must reiterate: 1 star, and not worth your time if you want to play OTB.  I suppose if you just want to play the original game it's fine, but the original has significantly less replay value.",1,2,1.1.32,2017-09-10 03:30:48,"Hello,

This app is great to play, it also acts of sort of, a tutorial for playing the physical board game, which is handy, while standing alone as a great mobile game on its own merits. The most valuable use of it I believe, is being able to figure out if the game is for you without having to drop 30-40 pounds on the board game itself. I thought it would be counter intuitive to the theory of playing less video games and more board games, but this one gets the balance spot on and just encourages to play physical games, while also scratching the itch to play...something.",5,2,1.1.32,2017-02-22 04:31:57,,

I'll be doing great, no outbreaks, 3 of 4 diseases cured, and the AI pulls the rug out from under you.  Typical scenario: an Epidemic card is drawn for a city that is already infected, this produces an outbreak infecting all connected cities.  Maybe one of those cities already had two infected cubes, now it has three.  Then three infected city cards are drawn.  Oh damn!  What amazingly bad luck, one of the city cards just happens to be the same city card as was drawn from the bottom of the pile for the Epidemic!  You get the pinball effect, game over.  I've lost so many games this way, games that looked like they were in the bag, definite win within 1-2 turns.  I told a friend who's played the board game a lot so he download it and gave it a try.

You can purchase 2 in-apps parts of Pandemic: On the Brink expansion. The first in-app adds new roles and events, the second in-app adds the virulent strain challenge mode.

To get them, visit the ""Store"" page inside the application.

Having the button on the main screen would definitely makes more sense! Thanks for the opinion!

Pandemic is meant to be challenging.

The following guidelines will help:
1- Play Introductory difficulty.
2- Use the ""Dream Team"" (Medic-Researcher-Scientist).
3- Use your cards to travel to highly infected regions to treat some cubes.
4- Prioritize the Medic to treat cubes.
5- Use the Scientist-Researcher combo to find cures.

Good Luck!",2015-10-15 06:04:20

Pandemic is meant to be challenging.
The following guidelines will help:
1- Play Introductory difficulty.
2- Use the ""Dream Team"" (Medic-Researcher-Scientist).
3- Use your cards to travel to highly infected regions to treat some cubes.
4- Prioritize the Medic to treat cubes.
5- Use the Scientist-Researcher combo to find cures.
