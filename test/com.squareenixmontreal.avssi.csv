No hidden fees or anything. Buy the game once and that's it, there is nothing else you need to buy. You also don't need to be online to play. Just once for the first time to download the game data and that's it.   It's fun and a great nostalgic ride. Everyone should pick it up!",5,4,1.0.1,2017-05-19 08:27:11,,

No in app purchases garbage, no 'Smurfberries' to collect and even controller support?  I was more than thrilled to support this $4 purchase and out the door game.  Love it and highly recommend it as well.  Can we get the soundtrack too?  As always Taito keeps it going with great music to back the gameplay.  Keep it up!",5,47,1.0.1,2017-05-18 10:54:27,,
