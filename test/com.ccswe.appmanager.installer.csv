All was fine but recently WiFi calling wasn't working likely unrelated but I suspected it was. So I tried enabling what I thought would be the culprit. Instead I broke my phones home, menu buttons and had to factory reset it which takes longer than it sounds backing up files. Of course this is my fault, it's just annoying that previous versions of the app break so often... Disable with caution! Make a list!",3,8,1.0.0,2020-12-04 02:34:50,,

The installer will not be removed from the Play Store so the $2.49 is a one time payment and if the license is revoked a new version will be distributed via a $0.99 in-app purchase.

Allows for more advanced, granular control than many other Package managers.  Although, perhaps the Dev could consider hosting the App on his own site/3rd party stores or maybe charging a monthly subscription instead, at this point! :) 😉",5,5,1.0.0,2020-12-02 12:02:31,,
