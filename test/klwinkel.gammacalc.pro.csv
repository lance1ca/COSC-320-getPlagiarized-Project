In Canada we use 480mR/hr not 520 or 590 like in the settings. I have emailed asking to have it fixed with no reply. It is a big difference in value and can alter our times quite significantly.

Beside that, the values in the app are ""H/hr/Ci @ 1foot"", your value is for  meter distance isn't it?
in that case, 5.2 is the value to use for you (5.2 R/hr/Ci @ 1foot eq. to 483 mR/hr/Ci @ 1 meter)",2019-01-22 03:38:37

I decided to purchase the pro version and I'm a little disappointed. The app constantly freezes and stops upon starting every time you open the app. So you have to restart the app again every time you want to use it.
