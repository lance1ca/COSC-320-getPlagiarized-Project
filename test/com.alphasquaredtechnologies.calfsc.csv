It would be better if it pulled new questions each test, sometimes I would get a majority of the same questions.

I've taken all their practice test and passed with 100% on all 5 chapters. Many questions here do not reflect the answers that the DOJ looks for. Example - you can make your answer deemed right by the DOJ handbook but this app will consider your answer incorrect. Maybe this app needs to update according to the DOJ standards for the state of California. As of right now this app will throw you off if you have read the DOJ manual.,2,10,2.0.2,2020-04-25 16:59:46,"Hi Joey, thank you very much for your feedback.
