Used the normal because I didn't know there was a pro vers.! Customisable colours is one of the things I was sorely missing. One the things I don't like is in the paged reading method there is page animation. Can you add an option to have no animation at all. When you next page it just appears. Animation is gimmicky and distracting. (I think)  Please add map-able click areas. Like currently left is back, right is next and that's it. What if you wanted to click top and bottom instead? or be able to go back and forth from both sides. (eg. top left and right is back, bottom left and right is forward). I say because I read on phone and tablet and holding the device is not always in the same hand or position. So being able to navigate easily and quickly is better. (See the manga reader ""perfect viewer"" to get what i mean). Haven't tried the syncing thing yet but will definitely try!  I think some of the UI could do with a bit more work.
