stars. I moved from gbc.emu to this because the UI and beautiful design of 
this emu blew me away. There are working emulators and then there is this 
emulator with skins to make it look like an old Gameboy or Gameboy color. 
On top of that the buttons have animations when being pressed and you can 
also adjust vibration if you like. These features pull you in in a way that 
no other emulator will. It makes this emulator not just functional but FUN. 
I want to keep going back to old games with this emu just to keep enjoying 
and playing with the skins, buttons, and user interface. I can even size 
and place my own images on the Gameboy itself to create the illusion of 
having put stickers on it. Now the reason I originally did not give 5 stars 
was because there was a described feature of automatically saving your game 
state and reloading it whenever and however you close the app and reload 
it. I found that feature was not working for some games and they would 
always reboot. The developer actually kept contact with me through email 
and to my amazement in a few short days he completely fixed the issue with 
updates! Amazing and now this is the Gameboy Color emulator of my dreams! 
Better believe if this developer releases emulators of this quality for 
other consoles that I would gladly pay to support the project. Not 
exaggerating when I say best gbc emulator for android, and I am picky with 
my emulators. 5/5",5,1,2.6.5,2018-06-05 14:17:31,Glad we sorted it! I have to thank you for all the feedback you gave me. It was very helpful!,2018-06-06 00:04:54

Visually, it's definitely the most accurate Gameboy emulator out there. Love the options to add the motion blur and the good-old spinach green color palette, thus giving the original Gameboy games an authentic look (which many other emulators on the Playstore seem to lack) and the recent addition of the classic Gameboy border is a nice touch.   There is, however, one crippling flaw I can't get past; The directional controls.  When I use my Bluetooth controller (which is a PS4 controller by the by, if that helps), I can only move in 4 directions as opposed to 8. It's crippling in certain games like Link's Awakening (limits Link's mobility) and the Wario Land series (prevents me from high jumping and crouching while moving).  Is there any way to fix this?  Edit: The control issue has been fixed for the most part. Still doesn't work properly on the analog, however that is small potatoes as the control issues have been completely ironed out on the d-pad, which is where it REALLY counts.  I have, however, came across another glitch; the color palette for the sprites in certain games invert whilst in Super Gameboy mode. It seems to happen in the cutscenes for Donkey Kong 94 (and only the cutscenes, minor really) and the entirety of Donkey Kong Land (major)  Edit 2: Wow this dude works fast. :)  I really appreciate how approachable the developer is as he listens to feedback and goes out of his way to fix the glitches reported immediately.
