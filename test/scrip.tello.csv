I like the functional UI that is easy to use and logical.  Some suggestions for the future:  1. It was not obvious but the numerical values are clickable buttons. When you click them that step is inserted into the sequence. Please make these UI elements more obvious.  2. I am not sure if it is a limitation of Tello firmware but can the hover duration be increased?  3. A big Red button to stop the script and land immediately would be great in case the flight plan goes awry :),5,6,6,2018-08-05 12:26:01,,

Hope they are included in next release. Otherwise a great app!,4,8,6,2018-04-13 09:56:47,"Hello Jim.  Unfortunaltely Ryze does not allow the video streaming while in command mode. there is actually no chance to have video together with command mode. It belongs to Ryze decisions. If they will allow that, it will surely be implemented.",2018-04-15 02:06:35
