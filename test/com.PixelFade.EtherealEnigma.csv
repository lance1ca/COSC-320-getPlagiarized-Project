I saw multiple ratings saying that game is super short, but there are multiple endings, and a lot of game time. It took me a few days to get all the way through and see every ending. This is one of the absolute best visual novels I have ever read through and played. PixelFade outdid themselves again with this game. I wish I could give it more than five stars. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to have a good time and find a great story. Absolute masterpiece.",5,3,8,2020-09-22 04:46:50,,

I've played all of pixelfades' games and have enjoyed every single one of them. It has a nice story with good pacing, interesting characters, a lot of easter eggs to previous games like crystalline and ace academy. The game overall is a very good way to just sit back and escape reality for a second, if you're questioning whether or not to buy this game: buy it, you won't regret it.

I always love their games. The story is really good and it really makes you care about the characters. My first playthrough took me around 10 and a half hours so there is plenty of content here. And there is still incentive to play it more than once in order to see the stuff you can do with the different characters. The only problem is that I'm not able to change the skip feature to all to unread. was hoping to use that for my second playthrough. That's the only bug tbh.,5,1,8,2020-08-30 06:40:28,,

I love how there's a side character from previous games fit in the script. But Lacks of illustration in some scene, that's a pity. The ending is not like how I expected, I prefer if the story would be forward 2 or 3 years to view their future, cuz you just left me hanging before credit (same like Ace Academy). Maybe Cristallyne ending with the protagonist and main heroine finally receive happy ending would be good. Hoping for sequel or new games tho.",4,1,,2020-08-28 21:48:07,,
