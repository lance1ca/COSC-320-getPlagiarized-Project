And just a little visual indicator on where the alien is coming from would be great. Also, I have basically memorized what the alien is going to do every single time. I don't normally tell them to hide because I see the alien is about to enter the room, I tell them to hide because I KNOW the alien is about to enter the room.

So what this game offers is a 2D maps(ugly designed ones too) where there are a couple of dots representing the humans and the alien. The human dots have to reach certain spots on the map and that is the gameplay. The developers were definitely lazy and looking to make a quick buck out of this. If they cared at all about this product -they would quickly pull it from the store and apologize for their mistak,1,12,1.0,2019-01-27 06:04:37,"Thank you for the feedback and we are sorry that you are disappointed in the game.  If you'd like to share your thoughts directly with us as well, we would love to hear it: https://d3go.helpshift.com/a/alien-blackout/",2019-01-29 14:23:48

It's an Alien game fit for mobile and has no microtransactions, so credit to the devs there. I think if the devs ever did another they should consider something like a Republique style of stealth, which I think is perfect for an Isolation style mobile game.
