Some strategies, like counting to a particular card in the board to ensure that the opponent doesn't get it, are almost impossible with the short time limit. Needs some kind of option to turn the timer off, or even leave the game entirely and pick it up when the opponent has made their turn.",3,12,1.0.0,2019-10-29 21:38:51,,

The positive is that the AI is clever and challenging. I would like to play it, but as-is, this is still in need of some improvements. 1) It's not very friendly for a small screen. The UI operation to get a card to display (which is supposed to be a long press, I think) isn't quite right. It's some long-press with a small move, but you have to do it *just so*. 2) Once a wonder is built, if I tap on the wonders to view it up close, the built wonder is not visible. I can't see what the AI paid to buy it, and I can't see what powers it granted the AI. 3) When playing the AI, the AI plays far, far far too quickly. When it selects a wonder or a building, I can't tell what it just took. Poof! The card is gone from the play area, and that's it. 3a) This is particularly worse when the AI takes a card, I have no idea what it's doing with it. I have to know what the AI's tableau already looked like, and what money, science tokens and military strength were beforehand just to know what it did. 3c) Worst is tying all of this together: the AI takes a card to build a wonder that destroys one of mine. Poof, poof, poof! All I know is one of my cards is gone, and it most have been because the AI built a wonder.. I don't even get to find out which card I lost. **that's awful.** 4) There's something I'd call a bug: during Wonder selection if I show settings, it overlays on top of the wonder selection area, but you can still see wonders. When tapping on a wonder, it takes it. It should NOT play the game while I'm looking through settings. 5) The choices for colors and borders for wonders to describe them as unplayed, played and available for purchase are far too similar to each other and the underlying background. 6) Why does it keep giving me game hints? I have played it three times, I know how it works. The game needs a little polish, I fear. It *will* be better, I'm sure.",2,19,1.0.0,2019-10-25 20:15:47,"Thank you Robert for these feedbacks.
