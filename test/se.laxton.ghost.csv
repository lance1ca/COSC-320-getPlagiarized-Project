Shoot, I believe the Ovilus is fake. So when I heard about this app, I was thinking, oh no, another junk paranormal app. The only reason that I decided to check it out, is that it is from such a respectable team. The first thing I noticed was that it did not include some junk random word generator sold off as a ghost hunting tool! It only had the tools that the phone itself had the sensors to actually use. So I decided to test each and every mode. First was the motion sensor. I put in on the floor in my office, and about a minute later my dog came in the room, which vibrated the floor and set off the device. Well, that mode works. I then conducted an EVP session with the app and with my Zoom recorder. The results were very similar. The app is much easier for quick burst sessions and playback, so that mode works. The last mode, the EMF detector, was one that I figured would fail. I mean a phone itself gives off EMFs, so how can a detector on a phone work? So, using a Mel Meter to compare, I started a test of this mode. It actually works! Someone actually made a REAL ghost hunting app!",5,10,1.0.2,2018-08-29 10:43:59,,
