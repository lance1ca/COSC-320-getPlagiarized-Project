The incompetent devs couldn't figure out basic controller mapping. Mainly with 'X' and 'Y'. Whenever I map 'Y' to the Y button on my controller, it either binds to 'X', or it just doesn't function at all, and vice versa. I tried with 17 DIFFERENT CONTROLLERS and it didn't work on either of them. A great game ruined by an awful port. If I could have it delisted, I would.

Controls when you explore a forest or cave are...not bad I suppose but again I had a controller when I first played. For $14 it's a good deal though 8$ for the gallery is a bit much.

Sadly, it is horrid on an Android... They did not do a very good job porting it over, as the touch screen controls are lazy and unimaginative. When navigating an exploration area, for example (a common feature used throughout the game, which is oftentimes mandatory if you want to progress the story), after heading down a branching path, you may find yourself unable to go back the way you came, simply because the game isn't registering your touch on the bottom-right hand corner of the screen. The window for it is far too narrow. This is a huge oversight, as it can hinder progress and stop you from wanting to loot the area's chests.  If they had only applied a more user-friendly control system, this port would be phenomenal. As a fan of the game was excited to replay this wonderful game on the go, for no less than $17 after tax, I am extremely disappointed this wasn't handled better.  So take note, fellow gamers: Record of Agarest War is awesome. But you should avoid this version like the plague. Get a used PS3 or Xbox 360/Xbone, and buy it on there. It's worth a playthrough. Just not on your phone.",1,0,4.23,2018-07-18 08:26:36,,

You can either fast-forward through them and therefore have no idea what the possible repercussions will be when you have to make a choice, or you wait for them to talk... in Japanese only, of course.  Can you add an option to just instantly pop up the text and turn off the spoken audio?  Or could the installation of japanese voice have been optional?  (1.8GB is huge!!!)  The game would also benefit greatly if there were a built-in wiki/encyclopedia/game guide that showed more about the stuff you've done, or where you can get some specific material for alchemy crafting or things like that.
