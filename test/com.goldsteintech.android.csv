I was playing at a course that had GPS on the carts. On a par 3 I pulled the club to what cart gps said. I overshot the green. I then checked my phone and it showed an 18 yard difference. the sky droid app was right, the cart GPS was wrong.

The Google Maps integration lets you zoom in on the green and touch the current pin position to get a yardage from where you stand.  You can touch anything in the overhead view, bunkers, trees, hazards and get a distance.  Excellent!  I compared the distances provided by this app side by side with my SkyCaddie (before I sold it on eBay) and they were identical in most cases.  I can stand on fairway yardage markers and be within a yard. I've found that I can leave the app running (change setting to ""always on"") and my battery makes it through the entire round.

Downloading a new course takes just seconds, and mapping a new course (if someone hasn't already done it) is easy.  If you are playing a course for the first time, this app is a must-- simply tap the representation of the green and you get a satellite view of the hole, showing any hazards that might not be immediately visible from the tee box.

My local course wasn't available for download so I used the app to navigate to my course. Usually viewing the area under Google maps I cannot make out any details as that particular area is very pixelated.  I went ahead and mapped the course putting in bunkers and water hazards. All this was completed in 20 minutes and is dead easy to accomplish.  Anyone who knows the layout of a course can do it too. In the past when I mapped a course myself using SkyCaddie I had to be physically on the course to record Front, Middle, Back of every green which took usually 3-4 hours including trip to the course the best part of a day was gone.  After which I had to upload it to the internet site, get it verified and wait until it was put onto their servers which could take a month or two. I couldn't believe it when I installed the app I checked to see if my local course was there and it was.  After downloading course I went to the course which is nearby.

I have used three Golf Apps and SkyCaddie and Garmin GPS. Here are my Findings:  SkyCaddie definitely is the most accurate and then Garmin Approach G3.  Golfshot vs Golflogix vs SkyDroid are all within 1 yard of each other on my Droid Razr Maxx. Each can be up to 5 yards off with an average being 3 yards.  Golfshot is a great deal at 30.00 and very easy to use. I also have received several email correspondences answering questions before I purchased. Much better than Golflogix. Both units have all stats tracking and fairly easy to use. GL seems to freeze up much more than any unit.  Now for SkyDroid. What a great value since you can download and map the courses you play very easily. They do not have stats tracking right now. Both GS and SD are much easier on battery than GL.  Overall as far as Golf GPS Apps go they is rating: Golfshot #1, Golflogix #2 (1 if they improve freeze up and battery life) Skydroid #3 if you want stats when they get that and make a few more changes they could move to #1 or at least #2 becuase of value.",4,1,1.7,2012-03-30 18:54:07,,

It might help if the course map could be downloaded to the phone like some hiking GPS apps do. Scaling the distance text with the map would also help a lot.

It's an easy, no frills golf gps app.  You can go online and edit a course map to add features such as bunkers, hazards and target points.  I find the zoom map view helpful for courses I'm not familiar with.  Used this on Sansung Galaxy S and HTC Sensation works great.  Start round with a fully charged battery and you should be fine for a 5 hour or less round.  I think issues with battery life is more so a phone problem.  Don't have bluetooth, wifi on and display at 100% while playing golf.  Of course your battery will die quickly.  It doesn't have a scorecard, it doesn't say it has a scorecard, just GPS.  Before Skydroid I used Greenfinder and Golflogix.  Each have their positives and negatives.  Golflogix is nice and has scorecard and club tracking features.  But you are looking at annual fee of $20 to $35 vs a one time $1.99 cost.  Plus those additional features definitely drain battery life quicker.",5,7,1.7,2012-01-01 05:25:06,,

Used the easy course mapper to map a local course (took about 15 minutes).  I took my phone with Skydroid (Google Nexus S) along with my Skycaddie for comparison.  On every hole the differences were around 1-2 yards.  Plus I only used 10% of my battery power over 9 holes.  Love the ability to map my courses instead of waiting.

I just completed a 3 day golf outing and two of the courses which were supposed to have an on cart GPS didn't have them active. I realized very quickly how much I missed having accurate yardages and fired up Sky Droid. Although the first battery didn't make it all the way through 36 holes it did make it 27 holes. Much better than the app I was previously using that barely made it 18 holes.,5,2,1.7,2011-07-30 13:38:01,,
