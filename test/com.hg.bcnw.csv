The Moto G7 Power does not really meet our minimum requirements for the game to run well. We require devices with at least a Snapdragon 835 to run well. Your device has a Snapdragon 632. Sorry! You can try to reduce the graphics qualtiy in the options menu for better results. Thank you.,2019-08-02 04:57:55

I hope this will get patched or at least more grafik options will be added for fine tuning. otherwise this was an instant buy. thanks for this port,4,25,1.0.5,2019-08-01 05:42:36,,

I've never heard of the series this is based on but im enjoying the game a lot so far. Its a slightly slow and confusing start but gets better explanation and more features as you play. I really enjoy the way the world map is set up as ive never been a fan of random encounter jrpg games so it gives you time to prepare. i have a minor gripe, i wish you could hover over items received at the end of battle and see what they are.",4,16,1.0.5,2019-08-01 05:33:22,,
