The aircraft are a great experience to fly with fully functioning flightdecks. Clouds and visuals like sun glares make up for a perfect flying experience. From a flight perspective, the flight models have slight issues (roll speeds on airliners are quite fast, stalls are not simulated very well, and some other minor issues). In conclusion, it is a great simulator to explore the skies and is well developed.",4,49,20.20.13,2020-01-08 15:23:31,,
