Very similar to tactics ogre PSP too. I love every aspect of it. My only feedback ; setting to change view angle in battle & improve storyline. Current plot is child targeted (SPOILER: repetitive small talk & unrealistic how a vet easily entrusts a trainee). I love antiquia lost plot from KEMCO so I was expecting sthing similar, good job tho. 5star because not easy to find game like this w/o paying a lot or using emulator",5,0,1.1.3g,2020-12-22 17:31:46,,
