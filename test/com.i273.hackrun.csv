No doubt my 25+ years experience with Unix colors my reaction, but I'm not expecting a perfect simulation of networking technology here. I'm prepared to accept a Hollywood-ified suggestion of the real thing. But you've gotta give me more to chew on than 5 commands at a time, and only one that makes sense at any given time. The essence of hacking isn't a command line, it's mastering a complex system of imaginary machine parts in your head. A good hacking game would simulate a system that the player learns to manipulate through experimenting with the parts they've learned you recognize. At the first the system must appear dauntingly complex, but as your expertise with the game's system builds you can recognize that your performance is building from your mastery. Unfortunately this game's system is too rudimentary to create these feelings in the player. Two hacking games I recommend are Uplink and Else: Heartbreak(); I don't blame you for publishing a novice effort, but I would fault you for charging for it. I expect a minimum standard of quality this game has not reached. You need feedback from your players now more than you need their $$$.",2,163,2.1,2018-12-16 09:50:12,,
