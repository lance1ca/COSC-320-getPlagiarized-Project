The story was captivating and I like the remastered graphics. Sadly however there are some issues i encountered a soft lock during the lunar bahamut fight where after killing him his meteor killed me. His death animation played and i couldn't do anything but close and reopen the game. I also find the games lack of optional bosses disappointing as FFIV had 2 bosses you could fight during new game + this has none.,4,13,1.0.7,2020-12-07 21:21:25,,

When clicking treasure chests, I tend to mis-click a lot and end up changing my character instead (what is the point of changing the on-screen character anyway?). Finding the option to use a weapon (i.e. healing rod) as an item is not obvious and Help makes no mention of how to do this.  Finally, there is no way to quit out of a game and load another one without closing the app. My other complaint is that the game seems to experience slowdowns during battle sometimes which can get irritating.

I am playing this on my ten inch Samsung tablet and it's great, can't imagine any other way. After reading some of the negative reviews I do agree on many parts. The different stories with the characters aren't anything memorable and it seems repetitive. I guess it's nice to see some new characters, mostly just kids that the older characters had and the two twins from the previous game that grew up (I thought they turned themselves into stone though). The part that really sucks is how a lot of the same music was reused. I haven't heard anything new. Overall it's not a bad game for at least one play through.

I started out really enjoying After Years. However, the further you venture into the game, the more repetitive it becomes. You have to walk through the same dungeons over and over again. Oh I just spent over an hour walking through a cave to Kaipo, but have to immediately return through it in its entirety to get a stupid sand pearl on the other side, exactly where I was an hour ago?  Fun times. Also, pretty much half the game is the final dungeon. If you thought the lunar subterranean had too many levels in the original FFIV, you'll be in for a wild ride in the after years. Pretty sure I entered back when George W Bush was still President and I still haven't reached the bottom. I am close to just throwing in the towel.
