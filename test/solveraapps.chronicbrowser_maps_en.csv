I really like the atlas. All the data can be used offline which is a big plus. You can immerse yourself in it for hours. The UI can be hard to use from time to time though.  Some suggestions to the author: 1. The timeline is a bit hard to use as the events seem to be grouped arbitrarily. It will be nice if they can be grouped with geographical proximity.  2. Once selected an event on timeline, I wish I could drag it to the middle of the screen so that I can center the timeline around it. 3. I am not an native English speaker. So some of the names are not familiar to me. I wish there is a link to wikipedia as I can choose language there. 4. Once selecting a period, I wish I could touch the starting/ending year to quickly jump to that year. 5. Jumping through years is not easy. Maybe pressing and holding on the timeline to select a year. 6. The labels on map are colliding with each other.",4,6,2.42,2017-03-05 23:24:27,"Thanks a lot for your suggestions.
