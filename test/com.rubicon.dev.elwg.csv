You can select various starting positions on maps.

I was 15-20 moves deep into several matches. AAARGH!   A new edition of the little war game. Feels like a rewrite using new UI. Not a good as the old one. Graphics too much, hard to see or pick units sometimes. Worst, the AI seems to have taken a big big step back.",1,38,1.10,2017-06-24 05:28:12,,

The ability to generate new maps with Minecraft-like seeds means we'll have plenty of variety, and I'm glad we can finally build our own structures.

I've played my share of freemium games and I have invested $100's into developers thinking I was supporting them, only to watch the same old freemium game model  nerf , buff cycle Pay to Play / pay to win model. IMHO The campaign missions are worth $5.99..   Negatives. The game is incredibly tedious and the playing field gets crowded to the point you can't tell what is what anymore. Some of these missions take hours to complete as well.    Looking forward to the next phase online skirmishes. Although if matches take this long I don't see myself playing many online.  The game is worthy of your money. Especially if you've invested into freemium games.. this one will give you a satisfying experience for a helluva lot less coin.",4,6,1.04,2017-06-19 08:29:58,,
