We play western KY rook. I'd love to ad option to see the top card of the nest as well as a 'Stand' option when bidding to stand on your partner's bid when it hasn't been raised. I've had to re-install the app as well since it was crashing.  Since there are no other options out there to play this version I am grateful. However, the app is quite slow. Having to drag the cards to the center seems odd since I should be able to click on them.   The A.I. is decent I wish i",4,0,1.0.1,2013-12-03 13:17:00,Thanks for the feedback!  There is a setting that you can change for playing cards that allows you to just tap them rather than drag them.  I will definitely be working on either speeding the game up for everyone or adding a speed setting that will allow you to customize that.  I'm definitely hoping to make it better over time!,2013-12-03 13:14:17
