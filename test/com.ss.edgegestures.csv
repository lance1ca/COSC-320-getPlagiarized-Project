Most of the review will be for android 10, but a quick note about using it on 11: It is now unusable for me for two reasons, one of which likely has nothing to do with the app itself. The first reason it's unusable I suspect has to do with Google removing the immersive mode in developer options that used to allow me to set my own gestures and hide the navbar, and removing it has seriously hindered some apps' functionality. The second reason is that it only sporadically works; I can get one gesture to work once (opening a pie menu from a side button), and once that's displayed once, it no longer works until I force stop the app and then restart it. I'm actually very sad about this because it's such a useful app. If this turns out to be user error, I'll update the rating and this review. However, up until the android 11 update, this was an essential app for me. It's amazingly useful, allowing me to get the most out of my phone and customizing gestures that the stock system will not allow for. You can set gestures to open a pie menu (clicking a button will allow you to open a menu to launch apps, or go to the home screen, or ... quite a lot of things, really), set left, right and bottom gestures that do different things depending on what you do on those edges, like setting a long-press on the left edge that goes back, or a press-and-swipe gesture that opens a particular app, or a double-tap that turns on night mode. It's amazingly useful and I really hope that I can get this to work again soon.",3,16,1.9.1,2020-11-08 14:03:42,,

Love this app. Always been a fan of gesture conrol, but this takes the cake in features. 4 Stars and a heart emoji! <3   One issue though (probably my fault)   I use an app called Immersive Mode with an adb command to hide the navigation bar completely so it doesn't pop up.   EG works almost perfectly with that, except when I'm using messenger chat heads or, In landscape, watching fullscreen videos, the right edge isn't responsive (I think it just shifts off screen).  I'd suggest making the navigation bar hiding option in EG itself so this app truly has it all and that'll probably iron out the bug it seems to have with other ""display over other"" apps around.

adjustment, which is one of the major features I look/pay for, diables the 
""auto adjust brightness"", rather than just adjusts the relative brightness 
and keeps auto on. That's a kind of annoying. Please fix it. Thank you! 
EDIT: Thank you for the prompt reply. Are you sure it is not in the Android 
framework? Even in my super old Nexus 7 2012 running Lollipop, it adjusts 
relative brightness with auto on. Any chance to add an option to recheck 
the ""auto brightness"" after adjusting the brightness as an alternative? 
Thank you! EDIT2: In this case, what would happen if you set 
SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS_MODE back to auto after edge gestures adjusts the 
SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS? If it works as expected in some devices, would it make 
sense to add an option in the settings to allow this? Thank you very much 
for your prompt reply. EDIT3: I did try manually turning on auto after 
adjusting brightness through edge gestures ans it works fine. The 
brightness remains the same until the environment lighting condition 
changes. But if I have to manually turn on auto every time I adjust 
brightness through edge gestures, it loses the whole point of using it in 
the first place. EDIT4: That's why I suggest add an option to turn auto 
back on after adjusting brightness through edge gestures, not force the 
feature. People can choose to enable the option or disable it. Everybody is 
happy. Thank you very much for the prompt reply. EDIT5: I meant adding the 
option (to turn auto brightness back on after adjusting) in settings, not 
during operation. For users, the operation is exactly the same. User 
experience wise, it won't complicate anything. Again, thank you very much 
for the quick reply. No doubt this is a great app and you must be a genius 
developer. I believe perfecting it with small improvements like this will 
make the app even greater.",3,7,1.3.3,2018-05-22 06:42:06,I'll try to find a better approach for this issue. Thanks.,2018-05-23 00:54:16

Love it. I have a feature request. Using Nova Launcher you can rotate the home screen to landscape orientation but the navigation bar moves to the right side which then covers your app. So if I swipe from the right it triggers both navigation bar and your app. Anyway you could mice your app to the bottom of the screen in landscape?,5,1,,2017-08-13 16:16:54,,
