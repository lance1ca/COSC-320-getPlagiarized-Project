If you strain to hear the voice, the sound effect will them make your ears almost bleed.",4,10,4.2,2019-11-04 10:36:30,"Hi Sherri, thanks for the feedback!  In the Options/Parents menu you can go to Lesson Builder and make custom lessons that run the games a certain number of times.  As for the voices, it's something we'll look into.  Is there a specific game that it's worse on than others?  Feel free to email us at help@rosimosi.com",2019-11-04 10:40:14

Turns out all the answers were the fourth selection and he just understood after a while that the fourth response is the correct one. That's a terrible model for multiple choice. Its very simple to make the answers random but this was chosen instead. That's shameful. I do not encourage parents to buy if the programmers are this lazy. I hope this is updated. Edit: Problem fixed.",4,13,4.2,2019-10-02 10:19:41,"I want to simply apologize for this oversight.  You are completely right, and I'm not sure how this passed QA.  We have fixed this and submitted an update, it should hopefully be available within a few hours, looking for version 4.2  Again, we apologize and please let us know if you have any more feedback at help@rosimosi.com",2019-09-09 14:00:52

Very well put together and makes learning fun. I was impressed by how well my daughter picked up some of the concepts this game teaches. Great job, well worth the money. It is also worth noting that the developer has been very helpful with a problem that I myself caused. Thanks again Kevin, excellent job.",5,11,4.1,2019-05-23 20:25:11,,

It was incredibly worth the buy. For just only a couple dollars she can have it all. I went through and bought 2nd and 3rd grade versions as well. They are all easy to do and some can be challenging but its nothing she will get too overwhelmed with. Its worth the buy if your child/children love to learn and do more outside of school. :),5,21,2.0,2016-01-12 11:18:18,,
