I expected to need to install drivers and muck around with configuration. The app takes care of that. Plugged the receiver into my Pixel 3 phone and the app started logging and displaying real time aircraft tracks on a map. Simple interface to switch between map display and spreadsheet of logged data. Great app. Simple to use and it works.Developer was responsive and helpful to questions.,5,0,4.8.0,2020-11-20 20:38:37,,

I have no problems with map, logging and interface. But work with RTL-SDR should have some improvement: if ADS-B source is strong (you are onboard or near by) hardware AGC doesn't work well, signal overloads ADC or DSP and software can not decode packets. Resolved this problem by removing antenna. Just receive signal without any antenna attached, stable work for two hours.

I have installed a charge cable but I'll have to pull the OTG cable and plug in the charge cable.  That kind of sucks.  I tried a OTG Hub, same deal, won't charge the tablet.

You have to unplug the OTG cable and plug it back in.  Here is another downside.  In my airplane (fiberglass) when I transmit using the comm radio it kills the USB radio, freaks it out and the ADSB Program pops up and tries to start working.  In other words coming in for a landing you might want to shut down the ADSB Receiver first cause when you start talking on the radio you will lose the navigation map!

Setup was easy. I immediately started seeing traffic on Avare and on the Google Map from inside my house. I noticed that more information is available about the traffic if you tap on the jet icon when viewing it on Google Map. The only information displayed on Avare is the aircraft symbols direction and the altitude. It might be more useful for a pilot using this app if you could tap the symbol in Avare and have the heading and airspeed displayed along with the altitude. I also read somewhere that this app was dual band. I took that to mean that not only 1080 but 978 Mhz traffic would be displayed. Is that correct? Battery usage is pretty high even with the device set on airplane mode using my Samsung Note II. I look forward to continued improvements with the app especially the potential for it to be able to display weather and general aviation traffic. Good Work!!,4,1,1.5.2,2014-08-20 11:45:55,,
