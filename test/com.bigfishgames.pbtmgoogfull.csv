Great length and had everything I would want in a game. I especially enjoyed the interactive HOGs. There are 2 versions in the app store. I recommend getting the $2.99 one. I wasn't going to play it because the version where you can play for free in the beginning costs more. But I found the $2.99 version and decided to go for it.
