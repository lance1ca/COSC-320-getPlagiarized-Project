I got this for myself, not for a child, and even I had trouble finding a few of the objects. It would be nice for the hint feature to have two steps - first just show what page the object is on, and if you still can't find it then reveal its location. I would also gladly pay to download the sound files (I love ambient nature music) as well as high-res digital images or prints of the different scenes (live wallpapers, maybe?). Great artistic work!!",5,23,1.1.0,2019-02-08 13:00:47,,

My 5yr old thanked me over and over again for getting this game. He thoroughly enjoys it and is so excited every time he completes a puzzle. My almost 3yr old loves it too but needs help of course. I love that it is challenging enough to keep them busy but rewarding enough to keep them entertained and wanting more. Love it!",5,7,1.1.0,2018-09-20 18:29:08,,
