While they designed it with children in mind, I feel that this app can be enjoyed by anyone at any age who enjoys bubbles. It has beautiful backgrounds, each one with different music that can be enjoyed while you pop the bubbles, or you could simply lay back and enjoy the songs while watching the bubbles float and bump into one another. I love using this app as a way to wind down for the evening. I'm also looking into incorporating the use of this app into my hypnotherapy practice at some point. The only thing I suggest for improvement is to make the bubbles more of a swirly rainbow color (like they are naturally in real life) instead of the somewhat odd window reflection on the sides of them. Thank you for making this wonderful app, I look forward to updates and improvements to it in the future. PS: The link to the music box site in the description does not work anymore. I was so looking forward to seeing what other music he had made. Alas, it is broken.",5,11,1.0,2020-09-10 02:33:06,,
