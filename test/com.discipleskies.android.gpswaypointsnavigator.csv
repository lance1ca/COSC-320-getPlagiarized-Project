its own GPS before relying on as a navigator for a smaller vessel that does 
not have the ability to make its way with its own onboard electronic 
navigation system. Before leaving shore, I added my waterway waypoints 
using manual address entry & using the touch feature of the map. They 
easily are stored in the Waypoint Manager. For my test use of this app, I 
crossed the lower bay from the west side (my home waypoint) to the Eastern 
Shore of VA at Cape Charles (my destination waypoint). This app guided & 
tracked my journey giving dynamic feedback as I progressed to my targeted 
waypoint. I enjoyed the ability to record my track and hope to be able to 
make subsequent repeat journeys where I follow that same track. I did use 
the Open Sea Map, but did not figure out how to get the channel markers to 
show. Would be good addition if it would use local position to provide 
dynamic weather update (chance or rain and winds). Very good app! I

I use it in conjunction with other apps in this role but it is by far my ""go to favourite""  I am involved in metal detecting and although retired, my pre retirement skillset soon saw me being called on in the disposal of unexploded munitions in Australia's largest WWII training area (now slowly being developed for housing) that other detectorists find while looking for artifacts.  It is not uncommon for me to receive a SMS with a link containing co ordinates of a mortar round or a stash of grenades or similar and a reqest for prompt arrival.  Likewise it is not uncommon for me to hike many km into unbroken bushland from my car with an extensive kit to reach the site.   The moment I leave the car behind this fine app is running. Being not so young I take breaks often in the Australian heat and often have to double back on my path to get around unpassable terrain.  I use this app to navigate to the location, store the location of every item discovered and the amount of times this app has allowed me to backtrack to a rest area to retrieve a piece of equipment mistakenly left behind in dense bush defies belief. Currently it is running at a 100% batting average after 2 years plus.  At the end of the job with proper use it guides me back to the car via the shortest route.  It's so good I have converted the SGT head of the army UXO team whom I obviously call for the stuff too hard or unstable to a user.  It's also brilliant for any simple hiker or explorer or detectorist. It has more functions than I will ever use.  When I went looking for a waypointing app I knew exactly what I wanted, chose carefully and have never regretted the choice.  As a rule I don't pay for full version apps. I paid for this crying ""hurry up and take my money!"" Then again, this is way to good to be called an mere app. It is true engineered software.  It is highly featured and so brings me too my only niggle which is as an old guy I did have a preference for the simpler interface of the older versions but I can only counter by saying that as such a comprehensive package it does have a learning curve. It is effort well spent to follow that curve.  Long review? ..... Worthy product. In closing I will say I have no doubt this app has improved safety and even saved lives. Perhaps even my own.

Is there a way to move existing waypoints to new locations using a background map? 5. Is there more information available in the app about fix and waypoint accuracy?  Like a way to record the accuracy of a waypoint, and set a required accuracy for a waypoint?  For example by setting a PDOP threshold?  Currently I wait until the compass screen displays an acceptable accuracy to copy a current position or record a current waypoint, like +/- 10 feet, but that does not guarantee the displayed +/- accuracy, which often is in flux, is associated with the position or waypoint I record. 6.

I also use it for locating my crab traps in the bay, which would be nearly impossible to locate without something like this app.   The app brings me to within feet of my markers every time.

Each screen, in fact, is offered as a separate app as well, but there is no integration between the screens when bundled into a single app. For example, the compass shows the GPS coordinates, but when switching to the sunset/sunrise screen or GPS views, the app tries to get GPS signal all over again.

We are often working with property that has not been surveyed yet so our fall back is to walk the property creating waypoints and trails.  The hard part is then getting them into a format that we use in CAD software.  In the past I've used a Garmin GPS and later a different software program on m;y phone.  I just did a study using this software for the first time and had great luck creating the trail but then I was not able to download the file.  I contacted the developer of the software and the went back and looked up when I had purchased the app.  It turned out that I needed to download the free upgrade and once that was done everything worked perfectly.  Thanks for the great service in solving my problem.  Homer Staves,5,6,5.20,2013-05-24 07:07:43,,

On my tablet screen use is about one third of available size. The only background colour is Black. The font size is small. In all these limitations mean the app is next to impossible to use out of doors. 2 The display is only in Portrait (with one exception discovered). 3. Entering coordinates you have four options. When you choose Deg/Mins the next screen does not allow entry in this format. 4. An extra app is needed to use a paired wireless receiver. 5 The app crashes indoors unless you use a GPS simulator. 6 The algorithm used to 'join the dots' caused by intermittent reception produces some very inaccurate results. IMHO it deserves 4.5 for potential but only 2.5 for presentation,3,0,5.20,2013-05-22 12:59:06,,

It is user friendly and smooth to use.  It isn't needlessly complicated and gets the job done really well. It's great that the arrow points to the waypoint itself, not to a offset from north, like other applications can. Being able to choose a waypoint from a satellite map makes it easy to find the point you are looking for, as you aren't necessarily choosing a waypoint near a road. The small installation cost is well worth the application, and means the developer can bring out more great applications :-) Thanks, Mark.",5,10,1.0,2012-06-30 22:45:30,,
