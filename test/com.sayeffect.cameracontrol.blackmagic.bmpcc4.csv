Prevent screen from sleeping option - If I had my phone to the person doing the slating and the phone keeps sleeping I have to keep unlocking the phone for them. I could turn off the sleep feature myself but this would be nice. 2. Can't stop the app from running in the background without going into the app settings and forcing it to stop 3. Option to take stills - Yes I know this camera wasn't made for stills but having this in the app would make up for the very bad way it's done in camera 4. UI - User interface is pretty rough, everything is grey and white, I often get lost in the app and the overall look is unappealing I still like this app very much, It's very useful but if something that worked just as well and was slightly more flashy came along it wouldn't take much for me to switch.",4,2,1.0.18,2019-12-24 09:37:13,"Travis you made my day.
