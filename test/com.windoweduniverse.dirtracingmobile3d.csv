The sound does need tweaking to sound more realistic, and not so droning. The game is a great start, and could use some updates to make it great. Cars need decals and #s. Nothing to crazy..just looks of odd with nothing. Caution flags would be nice to have, especially as easy as it is to spin out. That leads me to my next point. I feel the slick tracks are a little too slick, and the tacky tracks don't have enough grip. Overall a very good game Thanks!",5,1,1.01,2015-10-15 10:07:55,,
