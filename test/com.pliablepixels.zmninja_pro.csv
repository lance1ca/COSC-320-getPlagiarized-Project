I'm reluctant to remove that requirement - if you are generating a self signed cert and I remove the check, it basically eliminates the concept of trusting that cert.

Has almost all of the features you'd expect in the webui, and then some.  Rated 4 stars instead of 5 ONLY because you can't see the live feed.  I've set it to update once per second.  If the app enabled live streaming (or I find a config option for it) I'll update to 5 stars!  Totally worth the price, for the peace of mind.  EDIT: Turns out, the issue wasn't with the app, or ZM setup.  I was having issues with the ISP, and what I thought were 1 or 2 second stills, were actually just high latency in streaming the images. which appeared to be still frames.   Rating moved to 5 stars!

Make sure live streaming works in ZoneMinder - if it doesn't work in ZM, it won't work in zmNinja. If it works in ZM but not in zmNinja that means you have the cgi-path set incorrectly in zmNinja.
