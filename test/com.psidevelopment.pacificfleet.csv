Pros:  *Stunning, gorgeous visuals and beautiful ships.  *Well thought out surface combat; detailed modeling of ship buoyancy and gun combat.  * Addicting and fun.   Cons:  * ASW and air warfare is not impressive.  Submarines can only be attacked with gunfire (!) and cannot submerge below periscope depth. The traditional destroyer tactic of ramming a sub is impossible.  Dive bombing is too easy because the ship does not maneuver. Also, no fighters.    * All conflicts take place at the naval version of knife-fighting range, so it is possible for a destroyer to torpedo a battleship, or a battleship to mission-kill a carrier, on their first moves.  The most critical component of naval combat -- range -- is almost nonexistent.   * For this reason the most powerful unit in the game is the battleship, not the carrier. Like the carrier, the battleship has enough range to hit any target in the playing field.  Unlike the carrier, it remains fully functional at all times unless actually sunk.",5,2,2.10,2015-06-18 12:14:59,,

Strategic movements are the key to success. And to Ben Martin the reason why u dont have the range when they do is most probably due to u being in a destroyer or light cruiser,  while they are in either a heavy crusier or battleship and for the torpedo accuracy buy the TDC upgrade and watch ur wind speed. I hardly ever miss anymore. My only opinion would be to have a sell back feature for ships or upgrades and also maybe an upgrade for submarine engine as its just too slow to be able to be affective. ( i.e fighting against an aircraft carrier in daylight. Sub would be most effective as not open to attack from planes, but it just cant keep up with the carrier. Torpedo range is never reached. I hardly ever use the sub now simply due to the speed alone leaving it dragging its heels in battles.)",5,2,2.09,2014-04-22 07:28:58,Sub is best used solo.

Took a chance on the high price tho, but it's worth it compared to other games that are constantly begging for money. Love the thoughtful gameplay and graphics are great. Tutorial is a little weird but you will quickly learn the jist of it. I hope this game does well, randomly found it searching for ""ships"".",5,3,2.06,2014-02-16 23:50:59,,

It reminds me a bit of Silent Hunter 4 mixed with Endless Space. Regardless, don't be daunted by the price, it's well worth it. Think of it as the price of a meal at McDonald's, for hours of fun!
