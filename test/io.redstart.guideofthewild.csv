When I click a shrine from the map, it would be helpful to know if it requires a quest or a particular method to unlock it. 2. Being able to individually select which ""mini-boss"" I'd like to view on the map rather than all at once. Apart from them two minor issues, thoroughly pleased with the app and worth every penny üëç",5,13,1.0.4,2020-06-06 15:05:52,,

Thank you for bringing it to the App Store and Google Play! By far the best quick-reference guide for this game. My only suggestion would be to add an anchor link in the compendium to places on the map.
