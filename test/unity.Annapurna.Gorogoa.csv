It is more of an trial and error exploration than puzzle. It is equally 
interesting to watch as it is to play. The interface was clearly not 
designed for phone screens, but it worked out anyway! I think the biggest 
weakness is that it tries to be a puzzle game at the same time as it tries 
to be an exploration which means that there are parts that infuriate me 
because they didn't build on the language of previous interactions, and 
then there are parts that just felt like grind because I knew the solution 
already, I just needed to go through all other views and randomly stumble 
upon the one specific fitting screen to progress. All in all, the 
experience just blew my mind. I really want to see more fully functional

will crash from time to time, and doesn't give you any indication on when
