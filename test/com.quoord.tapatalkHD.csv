For those of you on here that feel everyone needs to follow the FREE FOR LIFE UPGRADE Policy, think again.  If they have quite a few people working on this?  That's a lot of time that they deserve to get paid for.  Not only that, but there are a lot of Software out there that is not FREE FOR LIFE after first purchase.  There are a lot that IS as well.  Feel lucky when you find those that do and hope they don't change their minds.  Some of them I think should, if it would help improve the quality of their development.  Apple and Microsoft both do not follow this Free For Life.  Not on their OS and not on MS Office, not on a lot of things. Adobe doesn't follow this either and personally I do not feel any GOOD company should.  Also think about how old your device is for those complaining about all these problems they're having and think how hard it is to make sure something works across so many proprietary devices as there are in the mobile world.  Quit your complaining or learn to program and do it yourself!",4,2,1.4.3,2013-08-18 09:22:21,,

No Pull notification is a major disappointment, the fact they prefer fragmentation by releasing two versions instead of one app that detects the device size and launches the appropriate components is also another disappointment.

They're basically squeezing out a few dollars from forum owners since their app is the best.  For now.  Devs, if you're reading this I found a bug.
