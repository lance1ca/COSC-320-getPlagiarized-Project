Everything beyond that (and admittedly, there is a lot beyond that) you'll have to handle externally.   A couple things that jumped out at me that would be very handy additions: -Camera movement. Oftentimes when playing back-line characters (spellcasters, archers, etc.) you can't see the enemies and basically have to remember not only where they are and therefore what you want to do, but also write down any damage you did to them in order to reduce it later once they're actually visible on screen. -Place markers/objects into the area. If players use spells/effects/traps that persist from round-to-round, you just have to remember where they are, which can start to become a bit prohibitive.  -Additional support for 5e features. Even things like tracking spell-slot usage would be great!",4,2,1.0,2017-12-11 07:03:37,"UPDATE: If you tap the edge of the battle map the perspective will move without moving the character, which can let you basically shift the camera to the monsters.
