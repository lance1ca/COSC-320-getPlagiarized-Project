This was my favorite game in the old days and now on mobile it's amazing. I was skeptical at first after seing many complaints about having the game on phone was too small visually. The font has the option to increase size so that is no problem. The game has zoom so you can use 2 fingers to zoom in and out on the fly specially during combat. There is no lag or load times which is awesome. I play on a galaxy s8 and the game plays and feels amazing. Must try for sure,5,4,2.5.16.6,2021-01-31 21:23:36,,

return to 5/5. This update ruined BG2EE for phones. The maximum zoom is now 
1/2 as deep as it was previously making the characters and everything tiny, 
even on a relatively large phone screen. Mine is a Nexus 6p with a 5.7"" 
screen, which is very large but still not enough to play the game. Plus, 
not being able to make out the details has destroyed the immersive quality 
the game had before June.28. it's no longer the epic experience the game 
was meant to be. This is not a bug. This is a design choice, so providing a 
link to a bug report page as you have is ridiculous. All your phone 
customers ask is that you increase the maximum zoom for smaller screens, as 
well as make the menu/map/journal entry titles a larger font as those are 
nearly illegible on a phone also. If that's so hard to do then simply 
release the previous version as the ""phone edition"" of BG2EE and reserve 
this version for ""tablets only"". Beamdog, why have you chosen to alienate 
your phone customers? The game was previously compatible for both tablet 
and phone and now is only worth playing on tablet. Sadly, the only Beamdog 
title worth playing on a phone anymore is BG1EE, since IWDEE, and 
Planescape Torment both have the same ridiculous limitations on zoom as 
BG2EE. BG1EE still works like the previous version of BG2EE so if you are 
on a phone I recommend buying that. But avoid all the other titles until 
they fix this issue. This update is why I was forced to quit playing BG2EE 
halfway into chapter 3. A great disappointment.",1,11,2.5.16.6,2018-07-06 14:40:18,"Hello! Please report these issues at support.baldursgate.com for investigation.

not in a no-magic zone. It says ""Spell cast"" but the animation acts like I 
was hit (casting interrupted and spell fizzles out). BUT I WAS NOT HIT.

longer ignores magic resistance and cleric/rangers can no longer cast druid

What it lacks in modern ""fancy"" graphics, it makes up for in depth and soul. It's also a former AAA title, so comparing it to most modern mobile games is silly. You can easily spend 200-300 hours on this game if you do all the subquests and really dig into the world.  I was also impressed by how well it ported to tablets. I'm running it on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, and it runs great. The only issue I have had is due to the lack of a mouse when a lot of characters get bunched up. It's easy to have a ""friendly fire"" mishap unless you use a stylus. However, that is a very minor quibble.  I remember paying $50 for this when it first came out on PC years ago, and it was totally worth it then. At $10, it's a complete no-brainer if you like RPGs.",5,0,,2018-06-09 07:09:25,,

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of a bug involving the touch screen not scaling properly. If this happens on your device, the game will be unplayable because the touch controls won't register properly. They really should put a patch out there to fix this. I know for a fact this bug is on Nexus 6p, but I think it happens on some other newer android devices as well.  Good news! There is a work around. You need to hide the menu bars/drawers at the top and bottom of your screen when you start the Baldur's Gate II app. I used a free one from the play store called GMD Full Screen Immersive Mode. Use this to hide the bars, start Baldur's Gate II, and then you can use the touch controls on the game properly, as they scale correctly once you've hidden the bars. You can then unhide the bars if you prefer. You just need them hidden when you open Baldur's Gate II.  I hope this helps people who are having problems with touch controls, and are looking for help troubleshooting this bug.",4,0,1.3,2018-03-03 11:27:10,"Hello! Did you try the 2.5 beta?

Sadly the port of BG2 to phones is much poorer in quality than the first game. Had multiple crashes when there was more than one spell going off, NPC and quest scripts fail, and most offensively the UI was  unusable compared to the first game's port. All elements on the right hand of the screen, from selecting party members to the side buttons required me to press to the left of where I intended to select, the further right on the screen the object, the further left I needed to tap.

If you leave the game and come back the touch is slightly off. So if I go to touch an item or character portrait I have to touch to the side of it for it to register the touch. You have to close out the game and relaunch/reload to fix it. Pretty annoying when you don't have hours to divulge to it or have constant interruptions.
