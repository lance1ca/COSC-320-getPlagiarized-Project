The app includes multiple choice questions, hazard perception, individual topic quizzes, revision on each topic, the highway code and much more!",5,3,5.1.2,2020-07-23 15:07:21,"Thank you for your excellent response!

However hazard perception is a huge disappointment. Convinced there's a bug as the app gives five points before the hazard has even appeared! If you have a go and rewatch the video afterwards you will see what I mean. Especially on the first video. The red ring around the car only appears on the 4th point in the countdown! Ridiculous. Also failed my theory test due to failure in the hazard perception part despite buying this app and practicing endlessly. Rip off!,2,4,,2019-08-29 05:23:03,Hello there. Thank you for your feedback.

Sorry to hear you're having issues with the app.
The app is downloaded and runs as standalone, it doesn‚Äôt need an internet connection other than to download resources, it doesn‚Äôt show messages about connecting to a server. If your problem persists it may be a device issue. Try deleting the app and reinstalling it on the Play Store.

If you go into your Play Store account and then 'My Apps' it should list all apps that need updating. Once you click on 'Update' for the required app this starts the update download. It's best to download over a WiFi connection as opposed to 3G or 4G so you do not incur charges from your data provider.

You should be able to navigate between the explanations and the Highway Code within the results and review section of the app once a mock test is completed.

Just to check are you downloading over WiFi? If you are, you may want to follow the below steps as this often works.

Open the app.
Select ‚ÄòHazard Perception‚Äô
Go to More - Extras - Reset app - ‚ÄòYes ‚Äì Reset app‚Äô
You should then be prompted to download the videos

If you have any issues with the above, please let me know.
Thanks

Just to check are you downloading over WiFi? If you are, you may want to follow the below steps as this often works.

Open the app.
Select ‚ÄòHazard Perception‚Äô
Go to More - Extras - Reset app - ‚ÄòYes ‚Äì Reset app‚Äô
You should then be prompted to download the videos

If you have any issues with the above, please let me know.

I knew very little about the road, or how to drive. This app was essential for me. The mock tests, hazard perceptions, and tests after learning about each topic, all helped me learn. The mock tests were the greatest tool however, as I enjoyed the challenge once I began to know more about the questions. I took my theory test for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and due to this app, I passed first time with 49 out of 50. I found this app essential, and was the only learning tool I used in preparation. I'd go as far as to say it's a vital part of getting  you through your theory.

Sorry to learn that your hazard perception videos aren't working. You say that you have tried resetting the videos in the app. Are there any errors displayed in the playback? Would you be able to email esupport@wlt.com with any screenshots that you may have as well as your device specs (RAM etc) and we will look into this for you.

Sorry to learn that you are not happy with the app

There are only 10 clips due to the file size. They're high picture quality and would take up a lot of space on devices if more were added. They are representative of what you will get on the test and will get you used to the type of hazards you will get in the test.

Thanks

Sorry to learn your videos are freezing. Do you have plenty of memory on your device? Sometimes if you have apps that are running in the background they can cause issues like this, closing these apps completely will help.

There are only 10 clips due to the file size. They're high picture quality and would take up a lot of space on devices if more were added. They are representative of what you will get on the test and will get you used to the type of hazards you will get in the test.

In my test most of the questions I had practised in the app some were worded differently but were essentially the same. It is essential you study your highway code thoroughly if you wanna answer those never seen questions correctly. Do not neglect the case studies and read carefully through the scenarios.  Although this app already contains the highway code I would recommend to buy the book version of it. The hazard perception part isn't great but if you have had enough driving lessons your instructor would have taught you what to look out for.  Download it and revise from the highway code and you will pass.,5,57,1.1.9,2017-03-19 01:43:21,,

The reason there are only 10 clips is due to the size of the files. They're of a high picture quality and would take up a lot of storage on devices if more clips were added.

The reason for the presence of only 10 clips at the moment is due to the size of the files. They're of a high picture quality and would take up a lot of storage on devices if more clips were added. 

They're intended to be representative of the appearance of the actual test, and will teach you what you need to know to recognise a hazard.",2017-01-24 06:53:49
