Works great with the D7500. To connect with WiFi you will need Firmware 1.10 installed on the D7500. I bought this app to have a live view while shooting videos for YouTube, etc. It allows me to control the camera remotely. I wanted to be able to check focus, exposure and start capture. It works very well for this purpose. Most features of the menus are exposed on the app screen and live view is clear. The manual focus controls are worth the price of the app alone. I like to shoot with a fairly wide aperture and this allows me dial in focus so both of us are within the acceptable focus zone. It's convenient to be able to set the ISO and aperture to get the best exposure setting without having to get behind the camera. Connecting with Wifi: You don not need to run Snapbridge. On the camera, press establish Wifi Connection. On your tablet or phone connect to the Wifi network displayed on the camera. In qDSLRDashboard, click the Wifi button labeled Nikon. Easy. Again you need firmware 1.10.",5,22,3.5.9,2020-03-18 19:30:34,,

There is another app strictly for Canon (it favors Canon cameras more).  This app also has downloads for Windows and Android. Some of my Android devices are too old and can't install the app so it's great that this product offers APKs of the older version / new version. Not sure if there is a huge difference between what you guy for $8.99 or download as the APK.  Thanks for this product!!,5,1,0.3.3,2015-12-07 18:17:19,,
