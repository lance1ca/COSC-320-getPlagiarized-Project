The game is absolutely phenomenal on Steam, so bought it on Android. Couldn't be more disappointed. Having a controller connected directly just causes an app crash - neither shoutcast streams nor any music that is stored externally can be found (could only launch when I disconnected the controller). I would ask for my money back if it weren't for the game being so addictive (on windows at least). I recommend buying it on your PC and steering clear of this version.",1,0,,2021-01-03 07:59:58,,

My gripe really is the same as the first game, and I hope the developer sees more of this in reviews.
