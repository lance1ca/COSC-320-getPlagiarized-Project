Music - 5/5 i loved the music. The whole soundtrack combined with the wonderful visuals, complemented the beautiful story. The heartfelt music alongside the ending gave a very memorable and emotional impact that left me in tears.  Graphics - 5/5! Artstyle looks great!  It gave the world real life and it worked well with the touching story of the game.   Re-play ability - 1/5! Don't get me wrong i loved it a lot. Its just that i dont think i'll play it again since theres not really much to see the next time around. The story was very linear and i had a blast. I had an amazing first time playing this.

To get to the next level, you can solve a small puzzle, but nothing super challenging. There's no element of choice, so it's basically just an interactive story. And the story itself is... Lackluster. The two main doctor characters are unlikeable stereotypes (an uptight woman and a ""laid-back"" man who doesn't respect boundaries). The POV character doesn't have a personality except that he loves this one woman/girl, River. And River is supposed to be autistic but she doesn't read like autistic people I've known. She's sweet but they treat her like a freak, both her lover and one of the doctors, so that throws me off a lot. Idk, it just... Didn't have much to offer.",2,1,,2017-12-31 12:48:21,,
