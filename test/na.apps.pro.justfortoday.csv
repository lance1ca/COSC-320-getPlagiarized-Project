I know you don't get any ads but your clean time date is so tiny and small it's difficult to see. There should be the ability to make the text bigger. Since the last Android update the program's notification system is not working properly. It's notifying me early early in the mornings as opposed to late in the morning when it's supposed to. I'm hoping there will be an update to fix that soon. Again price is a little too high for this program.,3,2,5.0,2021-01-03 23:46:57,,
