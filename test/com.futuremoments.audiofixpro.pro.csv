Basically all it does is increase the overall volume. I use mostly hard hiss removal and this is what I have noticed so the end result isn't better and typically worse than the original file. Would love my money back!,1,6,1.88,2020-09-16 21:18:09,"Because AudioFix also boosted your volume upon first export, some of the noise may also be boosted.

Its the only app out there that does this. It works flawlessly. I'm using it to boost my videos volume because everytime I use my headphones while gaming and screenrecording, it always records the volume lower, so I had to edit the video and adjust the volume all the time. This makes my life easier as a youtuber. One less headache. It doesnt change your videos resolution also fyi",5,5,1.88,2020-07-30 12:14:00,"Thank you for your review. üòä We appreciate it!

This creates distortion, especially on initially loud videos. Also, it would have been nice if the EQ's range was higher than 5db. REPLY TO DEV: I am absolutely certain that there is no distortion present in the original video. I checked many times with professional monitoring headphones. It would have been nice if our videos only got boosted by the ""Volume Boost"" preset. It is counter-intuitive to have to turn down the volume slider for other audio-reducing presets. Thanks for the tip about EQing the video twice. Although audio is usually better the less processing is applied. Therefore a higher EQ range would have been beneficial. Thank you for your work regardless! I will be keeping the app. :)",4,5,1.88,2020-07-27 16:47:37,"Thank you for your review. üòä it really depends on the original video volume. It sounds like your original video was already loud or already maybe had distortion in it? In our app you can adjust the volume lower or higher by a large amount so you have that feature. As for the EQ, you can always import the video again for further EQ‚Äôing if needed.",2020-07-27 15:53:13
