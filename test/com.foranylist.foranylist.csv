Really dig it. Would it be possible to get an optional description box for each note/list item? When I use a to do list (for example), I like to have my purpose or motivation for the task listed also, especially if it's something I've simply dumped on the list to do later. It's too easy to get emotionally detached from an item listed a couple months ago. It's nice to be able to attach a note to remind myself of why it was important to me.",5,1,3.13c,2021-02-07 14:19:47,"Thanks! Just turn your task into a folder.
