(Those missions are the only cut content - everything else is here, including cutscenes.)

Obviously being a strategy sci-fi game it won't appeal to everyone.",5,2,1.7.0,2019-06-01 08:35:18,,

It caused me to get stuck in a mission for over a half hour because one 
alien wouldn't get off the roof and I couldn't get an angle and couldn't 
throw any grenades. The game itself is true to the original, but man are 
the camera angles frustrating if you're trying to do anything inside or on 
top of a building that has more than one floor. It also auto-sets the 
camera to the max zoom setting, forcing me to zoom out for every action I 
want to do, it would be nice if they could enable you to set a preferred 
height for the camera. Another thing maybe worth mentioning is this game 
causes my phone to get very hot very quick. While this isnt anything new it 
does feel like it happens quicker than with other games. Filled with so 
many little bugs makes gameplay super frustrating at times, not worth 10

It's damn near unplayable to the end, and I have a crash rate of approximately five times per mission. Hopefully this will get patched up but I'm not confident. I've seen a lot of reviews glowing about the graphics etc but really, we should be expecting this kind of quality by now, especially for this price.

I am not experiencing these. People are saying it's a battery-drainer. Duh, it's a PC/console port.  XCOM: Enemy Within is a spectacularly well-made game for PC and console. The mobile port, however, doesn't quite live up to the original.  For starters, there's the framerate. I get about 20fps on my S5 with nothing else running. It's playable, but it's not optimal.  There's also the user interface. Everything on the management side is as well laid-out as it could be, with a few exceptions: one, it takes forever to load out your characters, as jumping into their inventories has a load time; two, camera and movement controls are sometimes hard to work with; and three, some crucial bits of information (like what exactly the continent bonuses do) are omitted.  That's about it, though. Nothing in this game has been omitted from the original, which is wonderful. The only problems are just part of having a mobile port of a console game.  4/5, I would recommend this to XCOM veterans, but I recommend first-timers play it on PC/console.",4,1,1.2.0,2017-07-14 06:01:37,,

I honestly didn't think I'd see it here on the Google Play Store.  It's a game, through and through. There's no micro-transactions, it's a huge file (for mobile games) it's turn based, perfectly suited for mobile.  It's a port though, so it has a lot of things removed, like certain cosmetics, maps, entire spoken languages for soldiers, severely reduced graphics, missing cut-scenes (from what I can see, the removed ones involve autopsy and interrogation) but I think it's pretty damn good for what it is. It even retains multiplayer, which is something I didn't expect. (Nobody seems to play it though, never did once find anyone else playing)  It pales in comparison to the PC version, but it's worth it's salt if you really need it on the go. It can be pretty cheap, I got it for three bucks, and it's normal price is 15. A bit steep for a mobile game, but it isn't a mobile game. It's a port from PC.  This ran really well (though with some slowdown) on my Galaxy S7 edge.  If you try this game, and REALLY like it, go get the superior version on PC, which is on Steam. The price can be a little demanding, but it has far more content, and mods.",5,2,1.6.0,2017-02-12 09:07:52,,

The controls work really well on a touchscreen (though moving  a character from one height to another is a bit of a pain). The story and gameplay are the same as the PC version and the graphics are pretty good too considering its on a phone. The only problem with this game is that it is a bit unstable on my Nexus 6p with latest Android updates. Sometimes the game will play without issue for hours; sometimes it will crash within seconds of loading a save game.

One warning for experienced PC players: at any given difficulty level, the Android version is unpredictably harder than the PC version, handing you more and harder opponents earlier  (on Normal difficulty, three Sectopods on a single large UFO crash clearance, an Ethereal on the base defense mission).",4,0,1.2.0,2016-03-26 18:17:00,,

Additionally it's a bit annoying that the camera resets to the default zoom level at each characters turn.",3,3,1.2.0,2016-03-09 13:15:08,,

If nothings  going to be done then I want a refund because  I don't want to have a game that I spent $10 on not working sitting on my phone. I could've used it for something else.  So please try to fix this and if you can't then I just want my refund because I wouldn't have bought the game if I knew this is what I'd have to put up with,1,1,1.2.0,2016-02-21 11:44:38,,

It may be the best desktop-to-Android adaptation I've ever played. There are just three major problems with it that made me knock stars off.  From least to most serious, they are:  1) The auto-save function only makes one save at a time. This is annoying to someone who habitually takes advantage of the desktop version's three-savefile function to rewind past a disastrous mistake and replay differently.   2) The movement system can be problematic. It can be tricky to figure out how to tell the thing you want to move up a level, because frequently the higher levels disappear. More than once I've ended up moving a character right out into the open on a lower level when I meant to move him into cover on a higher level!  3) The game is prone to corrupting itself to the point where it won't start. It throws a ""resources not found"" error, and per 2K support, the only way to fix it is to remove and reinstall‚Äîto the tune of an hour-long, several gigabyte download!

Edit:  So I got stuck in the middle of Mission 2.  When the guy that gets carried over from Mission 1 is selected, and he selects the cannon, the game breaks, can't cancel out, nothing.  I think it's the Tutorial about 'aiming' that comes up at this time (when cannon is selected) that breaks the game.  Buggy.   I've read some reviews and it seems this is happening to a few people already and there has not been a patch.  I'm going to replay, restart without the Tutorial.  I hope this works.  I still haven't seen how you can gracefully exit from the game.  (Edit:  You have scroll down from Pause Menu) I also sent an email to 2K about 3 weeks ago and have not heard a thing.

Thankfully I'm keeping my Note 3 as this game runs ok on Note 3 fhd resolution.
