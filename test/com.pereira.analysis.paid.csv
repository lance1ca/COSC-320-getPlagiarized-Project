I like best is that at any time in a game, if you see a move or line of 
play you think is good and don't understand why the program doesn't show it 
as the best or one of the good moves, you can actually start making them on 
the board seeing how the program replies to the move or line of moves you 
thought were good. Then you can go back into the move list and press on any 
move, then continue from there with the actual game by moving forward. It 
will then show you the new variation you tried, but will let you choose the 
new variation once again by pressing on that move highlighted differently 
in blue, or let you simply skip that new variation and continue with the 
actual game by simply pressing forward again when the new move variation is 
highlighted. No confusion, very user friendly. This is the analysis app I
