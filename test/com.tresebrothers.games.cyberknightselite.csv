Secondly, a couple issues that I've had since picking this up again after a couple years away:  1) Having some issues at Riccos Boat Serve - after selecting dialogue to get transport his dialogue box shows up but no options to continue or back out.  2) Less concerning (don't have to reset), but still annoying and more frequent (don't use the boats much once I have enough taxi drivers), is that when I select missions from connectors sometimes I get a Cyber Knights Stopped Working error message and I'm kicked out of the mission list. I can go back in and select a mission fine - from a new/updated list of missions.   3) A tweak I'd be interested in is it would be nice if reputation wasn't lost so quickly by time passing. If reputation gains were lowered a bit per quest and/or there were bigger penalties for working against a faction that would be fine, but it's annoying to me that simply resting  and shopping or bar schmoozing or wandering a bit can drop you by 2-3 missions worth of rep like nothing. It makes me feel like I have to scramble like a mad rat, always working against the clock, to build rep - rather than more simply being consistent and faithful with one group to climb their ladder. It could take the same or more time/missions without the current extreme of a two-steps-forward-one step-back, grind-against-the-clock mechanic. Also it would be easier to keep rep up with two different factions, as long as you didn't actively work against your friends and did some big jobs for them from time to time.",5,1,2.9.4,2017-12-27 14:20:59,,
