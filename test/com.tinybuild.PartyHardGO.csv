It's a darkly humorous little romp through the bad part of your psyche, the part that has that point where you just think ""Fk Everything!"".  The gameplay is smart and the gags are worth it.  However, ATM, the wonky controls are seriously hampering an already challenging game.    The problem really only becomes an issue when trying to evade the authorities; it's almost impossible due to the habit the controls have of just... stopping.  This gets worse as a level goes on; as the police are called throughout a level, their pursuit becomes more aggressive, making your chances of capture via the lame control frustratingly likely.  If tinyBuild could just make the controls a bit more fluid I would wholeheartedly recommend PHG to anyone with an anti-social streak / twisted sense of humor they'd rather express harmlessly.

When trying to hide bodies the main character will freeze after dumping the victim, you can work around this one by changing controller type get the character moving again and then changing back. 2.  A victim will freeze near the phone whilst trying to call the police. You can stab him multiple times and this registers as a kill but the victim doesn't die. I did work out that you could poison the victim which frees them up from the phone call but stabbing them then only freezes the main character and you can go no further to complete the level.
