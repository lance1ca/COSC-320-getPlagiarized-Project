[UPDATE] - Wow, I stand corrected.. it IS perfect! After I posted my review below, the developer commented in response to my review and pointed out how I could accomplish what I describe in my review.  SWEET!  :) ------------ [ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW] The only improvement I would love to see is an option to do circuit weight training instead of the standard - having to complete all of the Reps for a given exercise before you can move on to the next exercise when you are running a routine.  I like to do one set on each exercise I am doing and work through all of the exercises in my routine in succession. In other words, one set on bench press, one set on overhead press, one set on arm extensions, Etc, and then come back to the first exercise and start my second set and work through each of the exercises again in a circuit.  Currently in the app, if you run a routine that you have created, then it assumes you are going to complete all of your sets for a given exercise before you move on to the next one. If the app would provide an option to check mark ""circuit training"" and change the functionality to allow for this type of routine, that would be awesome",5,0,1.1,2018-03-20 14:16:17,"Thanks, Michael! You can accomplish this by using the superset feature, so long as each exercise is strength type. Edit your routine and press the superset link icon next to each exercise you want included. Now, when you run your routine, there will be an additional set of arrows at the top of the page that you can navigate the circuit with.",2018-03-20 13:05:50

Have you tried the new update? Also what happens? Just saying it doesn't work and giving us a 1 star is very unhelpful and undeserving. We work with all our users to fix any issues. If you read our reviews that is our number 1 comment. Please contact us at support@selahsoft.com so we can try to resolve the issue. ????

Unfortunately the cardio option only allows distance in miles and doesn't allow tenth of seconds.  For sprinters this is useless. We should be able to enter in distance in meters and yards despite using pounds for weights! If we could enter in 49.87 seconds for a 400m run it would be best... Right now I have to put my running in under weights which is weird!!!,3,1,1.0,2013-01-14 00:09:59,,
