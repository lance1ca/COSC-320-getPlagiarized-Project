It's a really enjoyable tribute to Avicii. My only complaints are that there are not enough beats to tap on (especially for Heaven) compared to how many beats there are in the song, and this makes it a little too easy. In fact, the hard part with many beats was all at the end of the song which was overwhelming. I think it should be distributed throughout for better enjoyment. The other problem is that you can't choose the difficulty for individual songs, to start.",4,0,1.1,2020-09-14 13:19:47,"Hi Braydon, thank you for the review!
