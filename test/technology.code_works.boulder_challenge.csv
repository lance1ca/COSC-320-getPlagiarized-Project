Better than several others. Interface is easy to use, and it's great to be able to be very specific about holds (especially for a home wall). Thanks for making it! A few suggestions: 1) I don't see a way to sort problems by grade or search for a range of grades. I only see a way to search for a specific grade. This would be a nice feature. 2) as another user suggested, an offline mode would be amazing. When WiFi is bad the app struggles.",4,0,1.9,2020-08-29 10:29:32,"Hi Brandon,
thank you very much for your feedback.
Searching for a range of grades is on my list but the offline feature is unfortunately quite hard to implement with the basis of the current app so this is not planned yet.",2020-08-31 00:40:06

I should be able to reuse a photo already on the app, if seeing a route for the same boulder, this should definitely be possible. A free version where you can only (say) access one wall. I have a home build, I'm considering using this for logging all my problems. But it's not reasonable for me to ask all my friends to pay, so I'm considering something else. But this app is so close to perfect :)",4,0,1.9,2020-05-29 11:54:53,"Thanks for the feedback. Template pics which can be reused are the high priority feature at the moment. So stay tuned for that. It will come soon! 
In total I don't earn money with the app and use the small income to pay the backend server and development fees for the app stores. So I want to use my spare time to add features without limitations ;)",2020-06-01 08:41:50

The fact that it needs to be connected all of the time and it constantly sends information even when defining a hold on a route essentially makes it unusable in my limited connectivity garage. I wanted this to be what I was looking for, but it's not usable for me in its current build. Cool concept, but I really suggest making some accommodations for users with bad or no connections.",2,0,1.8.1,2020-04-30 21:41:36,"Thanks for your feedback.
Unfortunately an offline mode won't be available in the near future because it needs too many changes right now. The data is loaded only when needed. And only the data which is needed for the current task is loaded.
To define a hold no connection is needed, but to initialize the editor and to finally save the boulder.",2020-05-04 02:40:17

Could we have a simplified marker for just right and left hand with no indicator for feet? This would be easier to read where feet aren't defined.,5,1,1.8,2020-04-16 02:25:53,"Thanks for the feedback!
I put the info ""feet only screw ons"" in the description of the boulder and don't define any foot holds. Or if this is common practice at a wall I just define only hand holds and no feet. It's up to you how detailed you specify your boulder and feet indication is totally optional. But can be used if needed.",2020-04-18 06:40:03

The offline functionality is already on my todo list but it doesn't have the highest priority at the moment because there are many more useful features on the list and the offline capability needs a lot of changes.

It would be helpful, if looking at a gyms boulder list, to see some indication of which boulders I have ticked already and even sort by that. Maybe the name could change color or something once I have climbed it? I had Open Climb, but after a while it becomes a blur of what has been climbed and what hasn't.
