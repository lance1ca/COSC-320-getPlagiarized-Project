When I open it, the screen rotates to landscape view and the right side of the screen is often completely black. Also, all of a sudden characters are not being written (partially or sometimes not at all) when doing a lesson. It might draw the left side of a kana and not the right, then prompt me with a blue dot to draw, and I obviously won't know what to do. This has been an excellent learning app up until this point.

The art style is very pleasing and the music is nice as well. However as far as learning goes you're better off elsewhere. Learning kana feels like a grind with this app and goes at a very slow pace. Hiragana and katakana have 27 lessons each and you can't skip ahead unless you've beaten the previous lessons. It takes about 5 minutes to do 1 lesson but by the time you've done 10 you've seen all the app has to offer game wise and it gets old / reptitive very quickly. I think it would be an OK resource for studying basic kanji but it offers just barely over 100.

The auto-recognition (whether you have drawn correctly) is brutally flawed, up to the point where you might loose all hearts on one hiragana you know perfectly well how to write. It can be very very frustrating. There are only a few minigames with not much variety, very dull and repetitive after a while. The algorithms are not properly adjusted to the lesson size, meaning in a lesson with only 3 hiragana it will stop after 1 newly introduced hiragana already to ""challenge"" you (doesn't make sense to test you at this point) , in a lesson with 5 hiragana it does so after 2 new hiragana have been introduced. Also when you draw a hiragana/katakana/kanji the app should pronounce it every single time but doesn't. It does not include any mnemonics, luckily there is a good series of apps called Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji Memory Hints by TheJapanFoundation, please use that (Google Play Store). You can't skip individual lessons / mark them manually as 'done', I don't see the point in having separate lessons for things like きゃ (kya) or きょ (kyo) when I have already learned き (ki), や (ya) and よ (yo) individually, extremely bothersome.

One of the best advantages of this over other programs is that you don't have to write 100% perfect the way the example is to get credit for a correct answer.  There is a disadvantage to this too in that sometimes it cuts off the tail ends of the letters (the brushes or jumps) when you are writing so you can't finish the way you see in the example and want to.  That doesn't happen often.  One thing I would like updated is the review reading game.  At least for Katakana on the arcade mode almost all answers are the first button and almost no answers are the last button.  I'd like that to be more random.  As it is, if I'm not sure I know that it is 90% likely that the answer is the first button.",5,4,1.1.6,2015-12-06 16:31:57,,
