Caution: There are two places in the game where it's tough. 1. When you're Grimwall, you need to go into the room of your friend to collect a 'sledge hammer or broom'. If you're on a mobile it's frustrating to click on it because the touch is continuously registered on the 'heater' behind it. Took me several tried to 'get' it. You can try to attach a mouse to get more accurate. 2.

a good story and great characters go for it. It's truly amazing, but there

be covering the screen with your hand. You should be able to walk by 
tapping. I also experienced some glitches and the game froze a couple of
