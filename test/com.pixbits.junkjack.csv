: Was a huge fan of Junk Jack and Junk Jack X on my old iPod 4 touch. Found 
this on the play store by accident. Couldn't be happier. The level of 
detail with both what you can build and find, keeps you coming back for 
more and on a mobile phone much easier to control than Terraria. With the 
huge volume of awful games available on the Playstore, put your hand in 
your pocket and support a game that will surprise you in the care and 
attention to detail these developers have created. The IAP is purely 
optional and in no way required. Great to see you once more Jack! One 
change I'd like to see. The ability to tap an item on the inventory or 
chest to highlight it and then a single tap to place it in your toolbar and 
vice versa, rather than hold down on item and with another finger tap to 
swap it's location to where you're tapping",5,7,3.2.0,2018-07-19 09:19:30,,

this game when I was littler on my ipod. The only problem is that this 
isn't an amazing game. ""What the heck do you mean?! You can't contradict 
your self. It makes no sense."" Let me explain. This is a good game, it's 
just so different from the original version of the game, it feels like its 
not a remake. The Graphics: The graphics of the original was really 
arcade-esk and easy to understand. The colors were very earthy and dark, 
making it easy on the eyes and a treat to look at. The graphics for this 
new version are better and feel very polished... but not ideal. The use of 
brighter colors was not a good step in the direction of different. Plus (a 
personal opinion) the arcade style was one of my favorite things about the 
original. It just felt so... Junk Jack. The Charater Selects: Most of the 
things you have to choose from in the charater select aren't things that 
real people that live in the present year. It feels like your trying to 
dress up someone from the 50s-90s. I don't approve this. The complication 
of almost everything: In the original game, there were 5-7 (7 counting the 
jewelers bench and recycle bench) benches that did different things. It 
wasn't that complicated to build them and once you had them all that was it 
and you could craft anything (assuming you had the material). In this 
version, seriously what the heck? There are way more then 5! And not only 
that, but they are super complicated to make. In the original, the 
selection screen was very simple. You'd click the play button then click 
the world and start playing. Easy right? In the new version, its relatively 
the same, but to make a world you have to go over tons of settings for the 
world to make it. Shure its necessary to set up the world, but you'd not 
think so when the setting are confusing as heck. I kid you not it took me 
like 30 minutes to figure out how to change the world's game mode 
(survival, creative, etc.). It got me really frustrated and I had to look 
it up. That's not a good thing. Try to make it less confusing. Make it 
clear what certain buttons do what and how the heck you change the game 
mode! Another thing (which is a personal option). In the original, you 
played as one Junk Jack who had iconic clothes. Shure they'd change if you 
had one of the store bought things equipped, but in the new one your not 
him! So why call this game Junk Jack if there is NO Junk Jack? Over all 
this is a good game, or atleast is a mediocre time passer that impersonates 
a good game. Most of these things are arguable and are personal opinions. 
Please don't get mad at me.",4,3,3.1.6,2018-04-23 21:40:25,,

The planets are really something incredible and there is so many extra blocks to build with. So many biomes. Junk jack is amazinh in everyway. But there is somethings that i would like to see changed or added in. I have already played through this game 3 times (visited all the planets, built many homes and got most the special blocks and loot). This didnt take very long to accomplish. Getting ores will become very easy and I started to lose interest and thats when i started over again. Ores really need to be more scarce. Also with the planets... there should be a reason why you should visit all the planets. Not just for blocks or ores or armor. And getting portal pieces should become harder too. And the ""bosses"" of all the planets should be harder. It is too easy to kill them. I know these are kind of stupid complaints, I really do adore this game.

This game was killing it back in the days when Minecraft and Terraria weren't ported to mobile. While this game is no match for Minecraft, it certainly has its pros when compared to Terraria mobile. First, it offers much better controls. Second, the huge amount of treasures it contains means the game will have you treasure hunting a good deal of time! Third, it also offers a much more complex electronics system. On the other hand, its combat system isn't as good as Terraria's and exploring here might be a bit more painful if you don't like to mine your way down most of the time. My suggestion to the devs, try making the caves more connected, since that's pretty rare in this game even with the noticeable improvements to the terrain generation.   Long story short, Terraria is more combat oriented while this one focuses more on collectibles.

This means that the controls and gameplay were made with mobile gaming in mind and it just works! Block placing, interfaces and fights all feel fluid with touchscreen controls and the game has an unbelievable amount of content to offer.  Junk Jack was originally released for iOS devices in 2011 and since then the developers have continued to release updates for it and bring in new content every few months. The game was recently ported to Steam and has finally arrived on Android. It is a very polished and complete game and the amount of love and time that has gone into developing it really shows.  I can honestly lose myself underground mining and discovering new underground biomes with unique chests and all kinds of loot as well as portal pieces and altars which summon boss monsters. There are 11 planets to explore in total with each unique planet having its own ecosystem of flora and fauna.

Junk Jack is one of the best games on the play store. I remember switching from Apple to Android and Junk Jack not being on here. Almost a week after talking about it not being here they came back. For those of you wanting to play online and thinking it's not worth the wait well it is. You can play with loads of different people. One thing I wish we had or could have is maybe a little bit more space in our inventory? Like create storage bags or something we could take with us that would hold things inside the bag without taking up all of our inventory and the bag could take up like one slot of it, but the bag that we have could hold like 3x3 or something. A huge thank you to the Junk Jack team in creating a game that everyone will love forever.",5,7,3.1.1,2017-05-01 06:11:33,"Thanks for the suggestions Joshua, we're glad you're enjoying the game.",2017-05-02 09:20:03
