We encourage you to re-analyze your mole following the tips of the app.BCC is a lesion that Dermia detects. Probably the light or the focus of the camera added noise to the photo,which has caused you to obtain a false negative.You can send us an email with the sample so that we can help you in the analysis if you wish.

The A.I cannot return different results for a similar photo,seems that some of your analyzes were differently focused or in unnatural light. We always encourage that regardless of the result obtained, you go to a dermatologist. We will try to improve more to be able to detect more precisely those types of melanomas.
