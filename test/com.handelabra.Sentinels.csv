I prefer the physical game to the app when playing with friends, but the app is nice when playing solo, so I don't have to keep track of everything. The base game is so cheap and is fairly replayable and definitely worth the pickup. If you enjoy it, the expansions massively expand the replayability. Different heroes to combo together make for really fun dynamic playstyles. There's silly combos to see how absurd you can get the game.

None of the starter heroes do much damage so you play for a long time whittling down the bad guy if you can survive.

I was looking for a coop game that I could play with my kids and stumbled upon this little gem. First off, I think that the game is very well thought out and executed.  The battles usually feel epic. You can almost feel like you are a superhero bracing yourself for what the villain and even the environment might throw at you.  I was lucky to find the game when it was on sale for 1 dollar.  Though its easily worth the price even at full price.  Now we come to the elephant in the room.  The price of the expansions.  25 dollars per season and there are 2 seasons so far.  A lot of people will look at that (myself included) and think ""seriously?""  This is what you have to keep in mind.  Comparing this price tag ($50+) to most android games would make the price seem insane.  It is just a bunch of virtual cards and pieces.    But I feel you need to compare it to its physical counterpart as well. $50+ is a drop in the bucket compared to buying (let alone finding some of the promotional extras) all the pieces to the actual game.  From as far as I can tell everything that was ever released on the physical version is available with the expansion packs.  I have never played the physical version but I can imagine that this version runs a lot smoother and quicker since you don't have to keep track of life points or how much damage is taken with the many different buffs and nerfs that can take place with an attack.  Also with the android version you can save the game and come back to it without having to leave your card/pieces sprawled out over the table or floor just waiting to be messed up.  Not to mention there is a little bit of animation and a pretty good soundtrack.   Bottom line: don't just compare it to an android game.  Compare it to a board game equivalent and weigh the pros and cons.  If you feel that the price tag is worth it rather then buying its physical equivalent go for it.  So far I have been thouroughly impressed with the game and have bought the 1st season pass.  Last thing I want to mention is the first 2 seasons seem to cover the entire board game.  Now they have mentioned ""growing the game in 2018 and beyond"".  Could this mean a possible third season?  I hope so. This could very likely lead to some exciting unexplored territory (though probably another $25 as well).",5,1,2.5.10,2018-03-11 07:26:31,,

The concept, execution, and overall gameplay are definitely five stars. If you can get the game on sale like I did (for $1), it's definitely worth it. Full price, I'm not so sure. My biggest concern, however, is the insane cost of expansion packs / season passes. Each season pass costs $25, and they save you about a dollar over buying the expansions individually. For what is essentially a fancy card game, those prices are outrageous. You can get full console games *on consoles* for slightly less, and top rated console games ported to mobile for *far* less. Even the season passes for games like the Telltale adventures cost quite a bit less than this. I'm someone who definitely doesn't mind spending reasonable amounts to support solid mobile developers, but I could never, ever bring myself to spend what they're asking for something like this. I actually think the devs would make more money if their products were more reasonably priced. I'm tempted to uninstall the entire game for a refund in protest of these prices, but since I actually managed to get the base game for a reasonable price on sale, I'll just stick with that. If the prices for season passes ever become realistic, I may get those too. Until then, I'll enjoy the base game as I try to overcome my shock at asking $50 for a few virtual cards and a half dozen storylines. Ouch.",3,19,2.5.10,2018-02-17 20:43:30,,

Each hero and villain is just as fleshed out and unique as some of the greatest characters of any mainstream comic series. Each hero feels different in their style of play acording to their heroic powers.  For example, Tachyon has super speed (think Flash, Quick Silver) therefore she plays through her deck very quickly, often playing and discarding multiple cards per turn.  Her attacks even become more powerful the faster she burns through her deck encouraging that style of play.  Bunker (Mobile Suit/War Machine) starts slowly by drawing cards and doing little to damage the enemy, but after initializing a series of equipment, he becomes an unstoppable powerhouse!

In fact, I bought it with the intent of learning the feel of the game and letting my wife try it out with me.  The down side is that it is slightly pricey for that effect, the actual game being I think around 20-30 dollars.    REGARDING THE GAME ITSELF:  That aside, it is a fun game and I got a lot of heavy use out of it.  If you haven't played it or know the concept, frankly, I'm surprised you'd even be here, but essentially it's a deck management card game--you chose a premade deck of cards stylized as comic books for each hero and you essentially play at that hero.  This differs from deck building games like Dominon or Legendary in which you are purchasing and creating a deck of cards to keep cycling through.  You play against an enemy deck, it comes with four villains which have different types of cards and henchmen that also come out and attack your team.   The heros have a good, consistent theme.  I think the deck that establishes the ""feel"" of the superhero best is Tachyon (equivalent to the Flash or Quicksilver) as she really burns through her actions quickly and you can chain on her attacks if you're careful.    Additional variations come from the different random environment cards which can be hostile or friendly, and do a nice job of intermittently ruining your careful plans.   WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL VERSION: That's the general game, with respect to the digital port, it is hard for me to say how faithful it is as I haven't played the physical game, however, it seems likely to please anyone who has played the original.  The music is a little campy, I liken it to 1990's SNES hero music, which to me is a great choice.  The computer takes care of calculating the damage modifiers and actions fairly well, making it a nice game to play even solo.  I will say that the option ""pick targets for me,"" for multiple targets always seems to default to attacking the Villain first, where usually I'd want to pick off the henchmen first but it doesn't really take away from the game.   My biggest gripe would be the cost, in that I'm really looking to play it with my friends and the physical game might be better than pass and play.  I'll occassionally solo on my own and if there wasn't a physical game I was considering also purchasing, I would not mind the cost as much.  Or, if there were some more expansions included besides the variants this wouldn't be so bad.   However, if you already own the game and you can't get enough and want a solo port to play on your own this is great and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",5,0,1.1.3,2015-01-15 13:50:55,,

While SotM, the card game is one of my favourites, the bookkeeping can be a chore when too many things get on the board.  This eliminates almost all of it, boiling the game down to the raw choices you have to make instead.  This makes the game a more enjoyable overall.  There are two things which stand out as flaws in the app:  Card selection for effects is a bit long and redundant at times, like if you have a damaging power and there's only one valid non-hero target it doesn't auto-select that target; and when playing on insula-primalus with an obsidian field in play, with Legacy boosting damage, and Visionary using Twist the Ether on Fanatic, I had to do a lot of choosing of orders for damage increases whenever Fanatic did any form of damage.  I'd think straight up damage increases would just be automatic, order shouldn't matter unless it's conditional (like Absolute Zero's Focused Apertures increasing only cold damage).  Again, considering the bookkeeping necessary in the actual card game, I can forgive this easily, but it does slow things down.

I REALLY want them to implement a multiplayer mode so I can play long distance with friends who also enjoy the game. I'm excited about updates and expansions!,5,1,1.0.2,2014-10-15 10:51:58,,

I am not disappointed in the least.  From the start, Chris's hand was definitely involved to keep this true to your tabletop experience. With the computer tracking  effects for you, much of the gameplay is even smoother. The dev team managed to cram even more comic book feel into a game that was already overflowing with theme by integrating the panel layout and page turns into the transitions from player to player.   This won't replace my desire to bring the original to the table on game nights, but it does mean that I can play it more often. This will be my lunch time companion for some time to come. I plan on purchasing all expansions as soon as they are available and hope that they can integrate an online multiplayer mode. The current format already does an excellent job of supporting pass & play.  Thanks to the team at Handelabra and at >Games for bringing one of my favorite tabeltop games to life on Android!

This app solves that problem and very elegantly.  Great gameplay, well-done tutorial, smooth and intuitive interface. My only complaint after playing through the tutorial would be that the sound effects are pretty uninspired. Seems like they were an afterthought. Still, not much of a complaint, and it doesn't affect the gameplay in any way.  Well done, Handelabra.",4,0,1.0.2,2014-10-15 08:21:44,,
