I like this app and am impressed with its ease of use and nicely laid out interface.  This new version now also offers the ability to add new individuals as well as just editing. This is easily the best GEDCOM  viewer/editor for Android I have yet found. Highly recommended,5,7,1.2.3,2014-09-18 02:35:51,"Thanks, Neal, for your nice feedback. Glad to hear that you like the app.",2013-11-20 12:33:36

Only reason I've not given 5 stars is that there is no zoom on the tree view which makes the text very small on my phone.,4,3,,2014-08-31 14:31:28,"Many thanks, Si, for your feedback. The latest app update (version 1.3) provides 'Zoom In/Out' capabilities for the 'Tree' page. Please, try it out and give us your feedback. Thanks.",2014-11-12 17:27:28

For a long time I've found a good app missing from the Android market.....but I think I've just found it.  To do serious genealogical research, I believe you need a computer and not an Android app, but this app provides a brilliant way to keep a mobile record of your family tree.....for when you're in a cemetery, Archives or trying to remember something when talking to friends or family.  For Â£1.87 this app is a bargain and appears to be regularly updated/well supported, so it must surely get even better.  A couple of points which didn't get it 5 stars from me are that it does not import all of the fields held in the records such as causes of death.  I use Family Historian, so perhaps this app does not support all Gedcoms fully.  It would also be nice to have a search facility whereby all records and not just names could be searched for when trying to find an address etc in a town. But so far this is app is brilliant and I would recommend it.",4,4,1.1.7.1,2013-12-05 19:42:48,,

This is indeed what I have been looking for!   PS: can the calendar be sorted on date or name per the choice of the user please?  Additionally, would it be possible to keep a log of the added individuals so that these can later be added when the user is back behind his/her desktop pc?",5,3,1.1.6.1,2013-11-13 04:27:55,"Thanks, Gershon, for your nice feedback.
