From start to finish of the main quest took me about 26 hours (not including all the sidequests, after game content,  and the arena mode). The whole thing has a Phantasy Star Online feeling to it, but with its own unique style and charisma, that really impressed me  2) Gameplay: The battle system is well fleshed-out and very enjoyable. I like the way that you are not timed to take your moves, unlike many Final Fantasy titles. Another strength of the game is that you have great control over its difficulty, and later, even obtaining choice over whether or not you encounter basic enemies. At the same time Boss Battles still keep their same levels regardless of what skill level you choose at the start of a quest, so you still get that feeling of progress and keeping the game at reasonable difficulty. Controls are easy and intuitive, if just a tad finicky in the camera department.  3) Presentation: From the engaging fully orchestrated music scores, to the 3D Character and equipment models, to the voice acting, and well animated cutscenes, this game looks and feels console a quality experience in the palm of your hand. Sure there are games with better graphics out there, but the art style in Chaos Rings 3 is still delightful to look at and never got in the way of myself taking the experience seriously.  4) Final Thoughts: Chaos Rings 3, for even a mild RPG fan, is worth every penny in my opinion. The story, gameplay, and presentation are all quite engaging, and to use book terminology, I would say its definitely a ""page turner."" The production definitely felt high budget and gave a fully-fledged RPG on an epic scale, to mobile gaming. My only complaint is that the ending felt rather abrupt and left me seriously wanting for a sequel. All in all, this game is a worthy addition to any mobile gamer's library, especially those who enjoy a good rpg. Here's to hoping that mobile gaming receives more beautiful, engaging, quality titles such as this one!  9/10",5,2,1.1.1,2017-03-14 11:24:54,,

The things I did not like was that it gets very very grindy late game, the  game was going to be F2P before they changed their mind to premium. This is apparent by the in game premium coins that give you access to special items.   You now get these premium coins by doing in game quests but it takes a long time to get enough to buy the good items (Unless you cheat with your calender)   This game is a great game filled with charm and awesome music thats held back buy the F2Pishness of grindiness late game.

Very close to Final Fantasy X vibe (still not there, but Media Vision can't hide their roots). Well written, but a little generic and overgrinding daily quest, with many links to previous games/characters. Some may complain that artstyle is a bit off, especially in comparison with previous in the serie, but is truly good. Finally, battle mechanics evolved into the perfect balance between fast paced action and turn base fights. 10 out of 10 Pigtapirs recommends this game!
