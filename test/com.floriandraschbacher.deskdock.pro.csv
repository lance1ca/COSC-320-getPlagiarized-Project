When I added 'ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}=""1""' to the line in /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules, reload the udev rules (udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger), and reconnected my phone, everything worked.

I am typing this review from my PC keyboard while my phone sits happily on my desk beside my monitor. Mouse and keyboard work perfectly and the little hiccoughs in the mouse smoothness are minor.  KEY: I cannot get this to install on my Galaxy Tab S (as of writing) which has a custom ROM. Developer and I exchanged 23 e-mails, the first response being within ten minutes of my first e-mail to him. So props to him for great support. Looking forward to getting my Tablet to take this app as well",5,1,1.0.6-pro,2016-09-09 11:35:05,,
