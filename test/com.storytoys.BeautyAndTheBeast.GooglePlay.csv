Great stuff but you haven't released anything much recently. Get your thinking caps on and come up with some new stuff. My daughters getting board. You've done the fairy tales time to move on... Think educational, science-based interactive story\puzzle books. ""The first kids on Mars"", ""My Dads a time lord"", ""Stop yanking my vestigial tail"", ""My clone ate my homework"". There you go that should get you started.",5,38,1.0.8,2014-08-04 13:09:46,"Hi Glenn, Thanks for the suggestions. We've released lots of great apps since your review. Check them out at storytoys.com.
