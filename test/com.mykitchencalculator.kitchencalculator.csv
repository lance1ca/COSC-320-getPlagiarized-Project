It converts volumes, weights, lengths, and temperatures, such as cups to tablespoons and celcius to Fahrenheit. It multiplies and divides recipes. It will tell you that a large egg equals a little under a quarter cup, that your turkey should cook to an internal temp of 165, and that the second gas mark on your stove controls makes a 300-degree flame. I often use this when I cook and use it every time I bake.",5,2,4.0.1,2021-01-04 18:40:54,,
