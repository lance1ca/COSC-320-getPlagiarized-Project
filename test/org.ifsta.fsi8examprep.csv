The questions don't make any sense and the answers are totally illogical. There is no way I would ever reccomend this app for anybody. This was a terrible waste of money and I wish I could get my money back. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! To IFSTA, Please reference IFSTA Fire and Emergency Services Instructor 8th edition, chapter 12, page 317, lines 20-28 with a emphasis on bullet point #2. When constructing a test eliminate lengthy, complex, or unclear sentences.",1,9,1.1.221,2019-09-20 18:53:36,,

It is a useful study aid and the provided page numbers and study deck are great. However, I need to ding the app for not being super user friendly. The biggest issue being that it will not save your progress on a quiz. Multiple times I've been going through a 500 plus question quiz and I'll accidentally hit the back button and completely lose my place, or the app will go idle and I have to start over again. It's very frustrating.",3,4,1.1.221,2019-05-11 09:22:37,,

I bought this in hopes of getting a better understanding of the material but all I found was poorly worded questions that had little to no relation to the state test. Lucky I read the book and was able to pass. My advice? Skip this garbage app and just read the book.,1,5,1.1.221,2017-10-14 11:32:53,,
