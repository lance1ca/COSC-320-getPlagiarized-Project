You guessed right! We're from Brazil. But we aim to make this app as localized as possible for native English speakers.
Could you please tell us what words you have found that sound weird?
This way we can make the app better.

We'll add this option in the future.
For now you can do this:

1. Clear app data (this will lose all your progress!)
2. Change the language in your phone
3. Open the app (this will make the app load in your phone's language)
4. Change the phone's language to the original again

Thank you for buying and rating!

Thank you also for the suggestions. The randomization is possible, but the device keyboard is much more challenging because in general it has more keys that aren't used in this app and occupies more space in the screen, and the user must not use the keyboard suggestions.

Keep safe!
