I do have two suggestions though. First, I wish there were ways to modify the game to switch things up occasionally. Second, there is a glitch where if you just keep collecting cards no matter what to the point where the deck runs out, the opponents will all just start drawing new missions instead of playing the cards in their hands. You can solve the problem by just not doing that, but it should probably be fixed in the AI none-the-less.",5,8,2.7.6-6648-0b1481d7,2020-06-04 07:59:26,"Hello and thank you for your feedback!

It loses my login details frequently and after trying many times to play an online game we've given up because every time it loses at least one of the human players mid-game and replaces them with an AI. Also the game is glitch and has no option to undo (or confirm) your move so when it glitches you're stuck with whatever screw up its done.

But I keep running into issues when I'm playing online where somebody leaves a game, but doesn't properly exit the game. The rest of us are left hanging...do we wait 15 minutes for them to time out and get replaced by a Bot? Do we all abort the game? There's no way for us to skip them after a couple of minutes. If the game is set up for the Bot to auto replace, do you lose the game if you happen to leave the app for 2 minutes? I'm also having a bit of difficulty understanding some of the basics of how the app works. If somebody is online, there's usually a green dot. But what do the yellow and red ones mean? When inviting friends to play, one of them constantly gets kicked out with a notice about timing out. When playing a Solo game with multiple bots, is there a way to slow them down so you can pay attention to what cards each is drawing or what tracks they're laying? Can you explain certain details specific to the app such as: karma points, ranked games, when joining an online game how do you know how many people are playing, how do you know if a player is more likely to stay in a game or leave a game early, something that looks like a horizontal stop light with 5 lights, why do my friends and I have different colors while we are playing the same game, and the list could go on.

It matches up with the tabletop version really well and is mostly easy to use. Sometimes dragging trains onto a route doesn't register (can take a few tries).

For a while, it was ok, but for the last year or so, the AI plays like an angry child without any intentions of winning.

The app does not try to access your files and photos. But it needs some room to write data on your device. The Authorisation to access the storage system makes no difference between your data and the room for the app, so it looks like the game wants your personal data, but it's not correct.

itself. I've been a fan of the tabletop version for years, and upon hearing 
there was an app, I got excited, because that meant being able to play one 
of my favorite games on the go for long road trips. Playing it with two 
other people (or more) in the ""Pass N Play"" mode is excellent. The 
experience mostly transfers over from the tabletop game, though it is more 
difficult to gage where your opponents are going, and how to block them, 
since you can't directly see the colored cards they're picking up from the 
face up cards, which makes the overall experience less competitive and more 
time killing casual. And that's fine, it's still fun. However, there's a 
host of issues with the online functionality that ruins the experience. The 
app crashes often enough for it to not be completely irregular, players 
will drop out of games unexpectedly, sometimes the you'll get kicked out of 
games, there's syncing issues with the timers which will unfairly replace 
you with a bot in the middle of a game, and so much more. The online 
functionality of this app is downright terrible, which is a shame coming 
from a paid app.",3,4,2.5.8-5289-82736993,2018-06-05 15:34:40,,

Rating 1 star until it is fixed or I get a response.  EDIT:  I got a response,  but was instructed to follow steps already provided in the app.  Still does not work...  App is back to working.  Rating is back to 5 stars",5,15,2.5.7-5279-ccf4aa89,2018-02-19 15:52:53,,

We are sorry about this, our team is currently working on an update.
Until the release, you can try this workaround. 
1. Open your settings.
2. Disable the account access for the ticket to ride app
3. Relaunch ticket to ride. 
This will deactivate the auto login and allow you to log into the game.

It's clear a lot of effort has been put into this port and it's very well developed.   My only issue with it is the cost of content. So that prospective customers know what to expect, I bought this in a sale for around £1.79 (it's seemingly around £6.99 normally). You get access to just one map (US) and all the other content costs between 79p for add ons and £4.50 for new maps. What you're getting really is just a taster of the game and considering it's usually 7 quid that's a very expensive premium priced taster. I get that the IAP model is the current model for a lot of apps but there is a decision developers make about how much content to offer for the up front price and if you buy this app for 7 quid then you might feel like it's not enough of an offering.  That said, the pricing model reflects what you would expect from the physical copy of the game with add on packs costing extra so it basically comes down to knowing what to expect from your purchase (which I've hopefully outlined above).",4,2,2.5.2-5240-551f3db,2017-11-29 08:50:36,,

There are some minor annoyances, for example; it's a little tricky sometimes to select the route you want (Palermo ferry route on the European map, I'm looking at you) on small screens and even on tablets the opponent popup that comes up when holding over an opponent's portrait is tiny and illegible. But these are minor inconveniences. All told, I've had this game for over a year, and still play it regularly. The online player-vs-player means there's always someone to play who's a challenge, and there are plenty of maps to choose from if you're bored with the basic game and want to pay for more. Money well spent IMHO",4,5,1.6.4-516-9bee8b74,2014-08-13 09:37:08,Sorry the game does not work for you.

It's great they just added pass and play for multiplayer mode with friends!  Suggestions: - randomize the computer algorithms so that they are less predictable. Eg. The Purple computer player always only goes for long segments and doesn't try to compete tickets... this is a good algorithm, but randomize which computer player is given this algorithm to be less predictable. - make algorithms ""smarter"" to reflect real world strategies.  Eg. The computer never takes short critical segments early in the game... this makes it to easy when playing against computer.  Have it take Atlanta-Nashville, or New Orleans- Houston, etc. when needed for its routes. - add new boards.  Eg. Europe, Switzerland, etc. - add difficulty levels for solo mode. Eg.

Full graphics, almost all of the beautiful sounds and lavishes of the larger interface, and all super clear to play. This even has pass & play and support to play against desktop users via the online play area!    However, there is one flaw for veteran TTR players, which is only fixed by the Humble Bundle version . If you have a Days of Wonder/Steam account with TTR maps purchased on them, you are unable to play those maps on the Google Play client, both single player and online. For example, I can join USA games, but not Asia games, despite owning Asia (and all other expansions) on my official Days of Wonder account. But, the Humble client can access this DLC with no issues!  However, the reason why I I have bumped my review up by one star is that DoW is not at fault here. Google Play policies disallow the developer to allow DLC purchased on other platforms to carry into Android.  If you have DLC already, use the Humble client, but otherwise, get a hold of this amazing train ride through the world!",5,7,1.6.2-452-2df0a357,2014-02-28 08:14:24,,

First is the UI. The Nexus 7's animations aren't nearly as smooth as those in the iPod. Not a big deal. But the layout is also poorly done. For example, when counting points at the end of the game, the UI element at the bottom showing how many route-cards you have, is so small as to be unreadable on a 7 inch screen. It's perfectly readable on my 4-inch iPod.  And more damning is the battery drain. Going into Settings->Battery shows that Ticket to Ride is consuming over 70% of my battery power. I seems like the battery has lost about 80% of it's standy-by life since TTR was installed, but I can't be sure. I am going to do some testing to see if it really is TTR that's causing my battery to last 36 hours, instead of the 10-days that it used to last.",3,0,1.6.2-452-2df0a357,2014-01-23 10:04:19,,

Playing on a phone is not pleasant and there is (inexplicably) no way around that (never mind that the iPhone version works just fine on smaller screens).  The Android version is also incompatible with the iOS version, so you can't play against your friends with iPhones/iPads (either online or via local WiFi/Bluetooth connections).  (This might not be the Android version's fault, since the iPhone version is the one that requires its users to use the Apple Game Center, which is incompatible with Android, but the fact remains that the two versions of the game are very different and won't work together.)  This Android version is also difficult to use in online play; there is no obvious way to create a new game and invite just friends to play.  It also lacks the ability to play a game via a local (WiFi or Bluetooth) connection rather than the internet.  So, it's a fun game, but all the back-end things that make a great app are missing.

My family plays it regularly on the Xbox 360. We all have Android tablets and so now we can play it in a different way. It definitely changes the dynamic when you can't tell what destinations people have. The game description was kind of skimpy and I had to take my chances to find out if I could play private online multiplayer games. I can confirm that there is indeed an option to create a private game and I was able to get my family members into the room and play a game. There were a few connection drops for a few of us but the option did come up each time for the player to reconnect so we did get to finish the game. Bluetooth play would be very welcomed as well as a lower price but I am glad to have this game on my Android.,5,1,1.6.2-452-2df0a357,2013-11-10 18:55:45,"The Pass-and-Play mode has been added, along with several other bug fixes and improvements.",2013-11-09 16:56:16

If I am in the middle of a game and then decide to do something else, the game will reset and my game in progress will be lost.  3) It seems, although maybe I haven't found the option yet, that all players in an online game has to be available at the same time. This is unacceptable for a turn-based game. Again, this is not a problem for other turn based games I've tried.  So, in conclusion, I would stay well clear until these things have been fixed.",1,16,1.5.2-311-22278153,2013-06-25 02:12:42,,

I also installed it on my Samsung Galaxys3 Mini. I didn't expect much of it. As expected, when it started up the game, it wasn't nicely fitted to the screen. The center seemed to be in the corner of my screen. So i only saw the top and bottomhalf. Pressing home and reloading the game fixed that, until I pressed play. But again pressing home and restarting fixed that. So I was pleasantly surprised that once ingame (and doing the small trick) I was actually capable of playing the game pretty smoothly.

I watched the tutorial (Youtube video on the Play Store) while it downloaded, and there was another in-game tutorial as well that explain the game very well. If you do those and run through one quick singleplayer round (They take 10-15 minutes tops in my experience), you'll be just fine.  The main menus are laid out well and its easy to find your way around both them, and the in-game menus.  Multiplayer works well, but it is online only. There's no pass and play and no Google Games integration. You CAN play with PC and iOS gamers, though (I'd like to note that iOS gamers have Game Center integration. Hopefully Google Games is coming soon!)  One thing I'd like to note is that my Nexus 10 heated up more than it EVER has before and this game exhausted my battery very quickly. I've never seen it get that hot before or drain that fast. About 2 hours took it from 50% to 0. Luckily, it died right after a round ended. Not quite sure why it's so demanding to run this game.  Overall, I'm gonna say it's about a 4.5 out of 5. I'd like to see pass-and-play and Google Games integration, then I'll give it a 5!",4,1,1.5.0-304-8a6f7834,2013-06-05 22:55:03,,

Also, a $2 ""pocket edition"" would have been nice since that exists in the iOS world. $7 for a phone only game is just a tad spendy.  As another reviewer pointed out, it would also be nice to be able to share map purchases previously made in iOS version on this new version.
