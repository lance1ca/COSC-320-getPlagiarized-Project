I also have Galaxy Note 9 like Rob Carpenter and I have no issues with export however it was a bit learning curve to figure out what type of export fits my needs. Now I am using mostly E2 which holds basically all available data and then I import the table as a new list to LibreOffice Calc. I use the table the other way around, so the only issue is that I have to swap rows for columns, which could be on of the options available in the export already, that's my only point here. Otherwise I think one missing part is the absence of PC version or at least Web based access to the database, so one could do certain operations more comfortably on the bigger screen. In such case it would need the database to be on a server, and that's my another point - I have Qnap Server at home and I would love to have this app working with database on my own server.

This app is extremely powerful and has more features than you can shake a stick at. I love the dark theme and the auto backup to DropBox. It's quick and easy to use on the fly and just in case you miss and check-in or check-out the stamps can be easily adjusted or even added to correct and fill in details. It works on JellyBean already and never stumbles, you can tell that the app is well made.   If you're into keeping time of your daily activities or have a job where your productivity comes into question then this app is for you. Get it, now!",5,0,4.08,2012-07-07 19:35:54,,
