Fiction has originated , in the beginning of human history, from just telling stories, and far too often we forget how important they are for us (the story is the first thing to get cut from games and movies...).  Inkle Studios took the well-known Verne novel, gave it a little spin by adding steampunk elements, designed it with a modern, simple, yet beautiful visual interface, used the obvious ""race with time"" mechanics mixed with the interactive storytelling elements of the ""Choose your own adventure!"" books, and wrote a superb score for it. (When the intro reached the ""... he was a gambling man"" caption part, where the globe starts spinning and the music starts up, it gave me the chills!) The result is a smooth and absolutely enchanting gaming experience.  I wish Inkle Studios great success on the market - shall they present us with many more great games!
