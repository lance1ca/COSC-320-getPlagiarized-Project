The other reason it may not work is because in modern vehicles the CAN Bus can have a primitive for of security making commands unavailable through the standard obd2 port.

It would be VERY VERY smart on the authors part to add widgets for the commands you buy so as not to have the need to launch in to the app every time you want to turn fogs on or unlock your door etc. They do tell you before downloading the app that each command will be an additional charge, though I assumed lock/unlock doors, windows up/down, etc would be bundled together as sets at least (nope haha).
