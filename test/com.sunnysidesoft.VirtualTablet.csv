I use this for doing online tutoring and it works very well. A few things that would make it better would be some hotkeys (such as an undo/redo button - i guessed mapped to CTRL-Z and CTRL-Y) and maybe any other useful keys. This could be available on the side if the active area is made smaller in the settings, or at the top of the screen (wherever it could fit) Also Multi screen support for windows, maybe where you can choose the screen you are working on very easily (it would be impractical for the tablet to cover several screens at once, I like the fact that you can cover one screen completely.

The app was unable to auto-detect my computer but did manage to connect through manually. Unfortunately it tends to lag off and on over WiFi... which could affect others give or take based on their signal. Server software comes with unexplained/unmentioned ""Flicks"" software which seems to control the advanced controls of the stylus... though it doesn't really explain how.  I do wish the tablet working area could be scaled to the screen or scaled smaller... using it on my SGS Note 10.1 I found myself moving my entire arm just to move my cursor... though it could be accelerated in settings. Alternatively a descaled interface that works akin to a touch pad would be nice. All-in-all not bad. If the performance were improved it would be considerably better.
