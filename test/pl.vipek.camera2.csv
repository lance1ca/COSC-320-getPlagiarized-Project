With this app the details are jumbled into a blur at any contrast in the picture. This makes it impossible to use for quick shots on auto (unless you want to take the time to edit and export a picture from the dag file).

I've been using Manual Camera with the Nexus 6P. It's still a great app but exposure compensation doesn't work. I've come across this problem before a long time ago on a Samsung Galaxy S3 but bypassed it by rooting the device and putting a stock Android ROM on it using the stock camera app from then on. Exposure compensation worked great on my Nexus 5 but I'm not sure why it's not working now. I've adjusted the ISO and shutter speed to get by but for some shots, all I wanted to do was go a stop up or half a stop down but couldn't do it. Is this a problem with the camera API in Marshmallow because I noticed Google completely removed Exposure Compensation from the stock 6.0 camera app. If this could be fixed soon it'd be great, otherwise, I may have to try a different app and see if it will let me manually change an F-stop.   Also, Manual Camera does NOT like saving to internal storage on the Nexus 6P. Deleting photos is hit or miss and sometimes it displays duplicates of images you swore you just deleted. I have to use QuickPic or Google  Photos to delete images with certainty.  Still 4* because when Manual Camera works, it's awesome.",4,1,3.5,2015-11-19 03:11:45,,

Needing to touch the screen is exceptionally annoying. 4) The preview image looks significantly different than the final image when you change settings. For example, taking a picture at ISO 100 with a shutter speed of 0.8s in my office produces an overexposed image (of course), but the preview image is quite dark.

This app provides access to all of the controls I expect.  The pictures and control are top-notch but the UX could use some changes. Exiting the application is non-intuitive.

It took me a few tries to remember to swipe from the right to get the  buttons (even though it's mentioned in the tutorial) it's just not like other applications which means it doesn;'t have the same android feel. The other oddity is the switch to view pictures.  You can click on the thumbnail view of the photos, much like other camera apps. Oddly when you view the pictures, the 3 button controls for normal apps show up.  If you exit the program from the photos when you launch it, it resumes viewing the photos.  I would have expected it to go directly to the camera controls; I want my camera app to always be ready to take a shot. The last bit on adjusting the manual controls.

The dev changed the settings to be saved session to session, so the only bug or oddity that I've noticed is that setting infinity focus on my Nexus 5 results in a very slightly OOF image.  True, there are some missing features here, but I'd rather have the developer implement more photographic features than try compete with things that Google already has locked down.  After all, my DSLR doesn't do HDR+/photosphere/panoramas/digital zoom/etc, and I've never missed them while shooting with it.  Which brings me to a few feature requests.

If you know what you're doing, the photos come out a lot better.  However, the auto-mode I feel is no better than the stock Lollipop camera on my Nexus 5. It's not going to turn the Nexus 5 into a point-and-shoot monster. Like the stock camera app, it selects too high of an ISO, resulting in grainy images; most noticeable in low light. This is where the manual controls are really useful, as it lets you turn down the ISO while the at same time turning down the shutter speed if need be for low light situations. I would really like some preset auto modes; especially one that has a lower ISO bias at the expense of shutter speed which is a setting that would be really good for still life photos. Only bug I found is that at low light situations in manual mode when im fiddling around with the ISO or shutter settings, it sometimes doesn't want to take a picture when i click on the button. I'm not exactly sure why. It's usually in very dark scenarios though. And also, it doesn't want to seem to stay in manual mode when i go back into the app after exiting.",4,5,1.9,2015-01-24 15:43:22,,

The result of the pictures need to be improve. It looks like the pictures taken by this app is to much compressing. I'm serious. 2. Your app is asking for location permission. I can't find anywhere inside the app to turn off the Geo tag. You must respect buyers privacy so we can trust the developer. 3.
