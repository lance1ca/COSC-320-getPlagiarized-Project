It's a great rpg reminiscent of the best of jrpg's in their haydays. Buy it, you won't be disappointed if you like unique characters and colorful sprite work, new and old mechanics, turn based battles, exploration, upgrading and some decent writing. This is not a kemco copy and paste waste of a game and money- you'll actually enjoy this one. Should be near the top of the paid list imho...",5,0,1.03,2021-01-22 22:49:38,,

I've played every Kemco game along with FF series. The story is entertaining and dialog well written. I also enjoy finding items in nightstands or bookshelves. The enemies are visible on the map, so you can choose to fight or just go around. A hate games where every three steps is a battle. The only down side to this game is the character moves way to slow. Needs an option to walk/run.",4,4,1.03,2020-09-22 11:01:37,,

Music is supreme love it. Also, very detailed and witty, sometimes Ara Fell is day and sometimes it's night in the start screen, first time I see something like that, very creative, all other rpgs you see the same start screen over and over again.
