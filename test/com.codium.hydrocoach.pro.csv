I think using a hydration factor for different types of fluids is unique, i.e. for light beer, I use a 20% factor so 12 oz supplies ~2 oz of hydration; I haven't seen a feature like that in other apps. I'm concerned about the amount of hydration the app recommends however; it seems much lower than what I've seen elsewhere, i.e., other apps may recommend ~90 oz a day whereas hydro coach recommends ~60 oz, but I'm no expert.",5,0,3.2.4-pro,2018-01-18 08:26:09,,

The design is fantastic, the Google Play Games integration is cool; it shows GREAT promise. Unfortunately, the most useful feature to me - its integration with Android Wear - is broken. If you enter a drink when you're away from your phone, it never syncs, and half the time, even if your phone is CONNECTED, it doesn't sync properly. Additionally, the ""hydration ratio"" feature is a great idea, but its execution is at best half-baked, as they don't offer any guidelines for determining what the hydration ratio IS, nor do they offer ANY sample data for common beverages. Additionally, the integration with S-Health is rather poorly done. S-Health already has a tracker for water, but instead of sending data to it, this app creates its OWN, completely REDUNDANT tile.   In short, if you're willing to pull your phone out and log it directly on your device, and all you want is something that tracks the actual water you drink, this is a fine app (although the free version will server you just fine for that). If you're enticed by all of its extended features, don't bother. They're fantastic ideas with poor implementation.",3,3,3.1.7-pro,2016-05-13 06:09:21,,

I think this application has the potential to carve out a niche and be the top of the water tracking apps. I would like to make a few suggestions to improve it even further: 1: MyFitnessPal integration: Enable me to track my water intake in Hydro Coach and have it sync across to MFP. You could even enable two way sync where water tracked in MFP appears in Hydro Coach. I have enabled Google Fit Integration for MFP and Hydro Coach. I am not sure if Google Fit displays my water intake though, or at least I cannot see it. Who knows? Do this right and Under Armour may end up making you an offer smile emoticon 2: Web Interface: I would be nice if you had a simple clean web interface that would allow me to track water intake, make adjustments to any errors I have made and view some charts, graphs while at my desk.",5,3,3.1.6-pro,2016-03-22 02:19:03,,
