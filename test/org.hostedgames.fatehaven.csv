The choices are shallow, it's some times very hard to guess which action will bump which characteristic as you're not in the author's head, and, anyway, they don't impact the story apart for some fluff text. I also feel like the author is quite bad at world building. It feels like the story is a set of action scenes lightly tied together with a story, but you never really feel like a part of the whole. On the bright side, the action parts are extremely well done, the author is adept at creating tension and cinematic scenes.
