On Windows 10 2004 19041.172 (prerelease/slow ring as of 2020-05-07), this works just perfectly with my Google Pixel 4. I did have to create a firewall entry manually; there was no prompt (but I've seen that problem with other programs on this prerelease Windows version, so probably not SoundWire's fault). I got a lot of lag and thought it wasn't going to work, but I just had to go into the settings in the SoundWire Android app to reduce the audio buffer size from the default (which was 256k, which is rather big) down to the smallest (8k). Now there's no perceptible delay at all. I also turned on audio compression and set the compression bit rate to 256kbps. PERFECT. The only way this would be better is if it could pipe my new Pixel Buds microphone through SoundWire to my computer to be used as a microphone for things like video/audio conferencing.

I spent a long time looking for Android music player apps that could connect via Wi-Fi LAN to my PC and simply play random tracks out of my entire music selection or from a few chosen artists or albums. The few that are out there aren't very good and have a lot of deal-breakers. Finally it turns out it's so much easier to let the PC host not only the library but the player and playlist, and just run soundwire to stream the results to my phone. Solved! It does mean I have to go back to the PC to set up or change what's playing, but I had to go and turn it on anyway to get the music library on the network and I usually only think up one playlist per WiFi music session so that's fine.

The first one, 'WiFi Speaker,' only took audio from my soundcards input, output & microphone ports. Of which I only use the microphone port for my webcam. This meant I only got the faintest of sound it picked up off my speakers & any background noises too. But this one also takes audio Directly from the speaker channel, meaning good quality audio. So not only does this app turn my phone into a WiFi speaker, but I can enjoy the music being transmitted & the features of the Pro version allow for fine tuning. All at a tiny fraction of the price a WiFi speaker. So ""Thank You"" to GeorgieLabs for creating this well designed, feature packed app, giving the functionality of a WiFi speaker without the high price of one.
