Star Traders Elite is the finest RPG in it's class. Highly intuitive touch controls hide a complex, but easy to understand economic gamesystem based around space trading. With a well developed background of Dune-like political intrigue among great houses and wealthy syndicates, the real story is told through the player's own choices...should i be a Star trader or a space pirate, a militarised assassin for hire or a stealthy smuggler? The choice is yours. Completing contracts earns you kudos among said factions, and with frequent trade you'll rise in that faction's military, giving access to new ships and weapons. With dozens of planets to visit and explore, unlimited ships to encounter, fight, raid, steal, upgrade or sell in your quest to captain the ultimate ship. With a well implimented learning curve, this is a fabulous RPG for newcomers and veterans alike. Advert free and permission free, Star Traders Elite is made by a top developer that constantly updates and genuinely cares, delivering top class entertainment that can be consumed in just 5 minutes, or over the course 5 hours. Star Traders Elite is a dream to play and without doubt the best in genre on google play. Highly recommended!!",5,2,,2017-04-22 22:11:40,,

I got the inquisition cruiser after earing a million creds or so, upgraded it, and aimlessly leveled to around 70.  What this game lacks is a plot, an ending.  Even leveling seems counter productive.  On the harder settings, the only way you get any challenge, your enemies level as a percentage of your level.  So the more you level, the greater the disparity and the greater distance between you and your enemys level.  You can have the nastiest upgraded capital ship and a small enemy fighter with a captain who has several levels on you will dodge your every shot and strike a manueverable vessel, and even board your ship with a 10th of your crew and in some cases just the captain himself can run through your ship unstoppably killing every last man! An insane game dynamic.  I've gone 1000 rounds on my level 69 crack shot captain missing every single shot, and that's not even against an alien, which of whom become monsterously impossible even with anti alienware and officers.  My solution? I started over and stayed level 8.  Fix your check system, get a plot, and this game would be gold.",3,3,5.6.21,2014-10-03 20:37:42,,

Here's why first off the game is full of content all available from the get go no in app purchases maybe there's one or two but they don't shove it in your face also a fully thought out economic system that you actually impact the world changes with your decisions and classes make the game great for replayability.

I got so laughably overpowered in Normal mode that I figured I'd go up to Hardened and try to unlock some of the rewards. Yea. Right. In Hardened and up you basically spend your first few hundred turns cowering with your tail tucked from pirates that enjoy an absurd numerical supremacy. They can move so quickly it's impossible to outrun them and they enjoy the use of ships that have many times the guns, armor and crew of any starting ship, so you basically have no choice but to constantly surrender your hard-won goods over and over. This is fine if you have the patience to ""role play"" a useless coward for hundreds of turns, but, personally, it's not for me, nor are ""in app purchases"" after the fact to unlock parts of the game I already bought.  I stand by my original conclusion. It's fun for a little bit, but it wears very thin very quickly with the dice roll mechanics and wildly uneven encounters and politics shifts.",3,2,5.3.3,2014-02-03 12:20:21,"Thanks for playing -- with a little practice and some strategy you can easily last 50,000 turns.

The idea hit me one day while playing... what about squadrons or a small armada of ships under your command. Say no more than 6 ships under your control so they fit in the screen during battle sequences. Imagine it! you start from a lowly freighter and build up to having 6 battle cruisers under your control.",5,1,5.1.25,2013-10-29 17:23:21,,

I am, however really enjoying this game in the process!  Well done!    One thing I found odd is how you get attacked by a pirate from a faction and no matter what you do in the situation (kill, run, or surrender), you faction standing drops for that faction.  It became quite frustrating once when trying to secure a trade agreement to protect against said attacks, I experienced two pirate attacks in a short peried which essentially dropped my rep back down to zero.  Sure it added to the challenge, but it doesn't make sense that it seems like a no win situation.  If the faction in question does not control the area you are in, and the pirate has no legal standing to be there, you would think that even killing in self defence would not negatively impact reputation.",4,2,4.7.7,2012-11-11 02:44:53,,

But please improve the user interface and especially the way the faction wars display.",4,1,4.6.29,2012-10-21 18:57:34,,

""Trading"" in this game sucks. There is no market for the ""Space Trader"" or the ""Merchant""....everything you buy from the Exchange is priced high and the sell price is ALWAYS below your purchase price even if you go to a planet that is selling the same item for double what you bought  the item for....and the ""sell"" price of your stock is STILL half the price you bought it for.    This game is ONLY geared to those that want to play as a pirate or some other ""fighting"" type.    Not for those that want a challenge using their mind to make a profit",2,0,4.6.13,2012-08-29 13:52:37,,

Its immersive, well-thought-out background is not very evident in actual gameplay, which is simultaneously a great accomplishment and a crying shame: those who want the back story can read the walls of text while those who just want to press buttons and make things asplode can ignore them.

There seems to be a decent game hiding under the covers.  Unfortunately, the user interface is so poorly designed that it actively fights against the player when it comes to understanding what's going on and carrying out your decisions.  The problem with this game is not that it is old-fashioned - there is nothing wrong with making a game that doesn't depend on fancy graphics.  But when one makes a game that is primarily text and option screens, it is mandatory to really think through how you organize the information & choices you're presenting to the user.  Information is presented to the user as large blocks of fill-in-the-blank text, when all you care about are two or three words.  This is OK if you only see this block of text occasionally, but, you're expected to read this identical blocks a dozen times in a minute of play.  The game isn't much about trading or space exploration - it's primarily about playing a balancing act between factions that get annoyed at you for a variety of reasons.
