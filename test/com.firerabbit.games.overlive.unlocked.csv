I like how its an RPG which was mixed with a choose your own adventure style. Though I got only 3 endings(Nuclear Holocaust, Smashing Through, Shadows) Its hard to find all other endings, I wish the devs would add a walkthrough/guide for beginners. Also, the way you tap on random locks/orbs and hope its a good event makes it hard to survive while exploring, I would suggest having a description on the events before you explore that on any mode.

I like the unique play style. The only thing that's keeping me from rating five stars is because parts is the UI are unresponsive. The red back button is critical to navigating the UI and I end up accidentally toggling the music on and off instead. Playing on Pixel 2 XL. Update: I changed the system navigation from two-button to gesture. Now there's no navigation bar hovering over the red back button.

I don't regret purchasing the game, but It could have been so much better. The writing and atmosphere are both great. But the combat just sucks, the controls for it are so janky. One of my biggest complaints is the lack of a journal to track your progress. For example, a journal to remind you what events you have completed, what events you have failed and why you failed them, or what items you have accumulated. It's hard to keep track when there's so many. Especially if I stopped playing for a while. I could just write it down myself , but this is a mobile game and  I play it while I travel, so pen and paper aren't always available. It's such a hassle.

The background story begins to slowly unfold as you make your way through further areas, and actions you've taken previously do come back to bite or help you.  A couple of things that pull the game play down are the way your options are shown - it is hard to keep track of the different branches within each area, and I'll go from breaking down a door above ground to lock picking in the sewers. This fragments the plot a little. Also, the background images don't always match up with the written description of the fight. A fight outdoors could be backed by the image of a toilet, or a battle inside an apartment could show a generic outdoors scene. This reduces immersion in the game, and given the variety of images present could be fixed by attaching a particular image to each action point.

The only gripe I have is the combat. It's too hard. I'm not sure if I'm suppose to find any new equipment along the way but when I get to the boardwalk I get killed in every fight or almost killed and have to spend precious days in recovery. I normally try the stealth route but I feel it's always a 50/50  chance. Maybe lowering the health of the zombies would be a good way to balance the number of zombies that show up in a fight.,4,3,1.4,2013-12-29 08:53:37,"Combat is definitely a risk.  Stealth route is a smart idea but make sure you have enough skill so you can pull it off.  Boardwalk is mid-game, before you go there or Downtown you should have found an upgraded melee weapon in Room 106.  Downtown has a firearm upgrade.  That will give you a leg up for sure.
