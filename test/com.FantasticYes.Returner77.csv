I didn't care about the story because it's delivered in these dull dialog clips where you stare at a person's face inside a helmet a la MCU'S Iron Man with constant audio clipping and bad acting. I just skipped them. Main problem is that the puzzles are all permutations of line puzzles (I stopped playing at The Bridge). Repetitive without the charm of The Witness. Would be a decent free game but not worth the price tag.
