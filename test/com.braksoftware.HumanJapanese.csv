The primary area where I found this a problem was in learning the hiragana and katakana characters, those really need to be drilled to stick.

I can't comment much on the kana learning bits, as I'd learned kana before diving into the app, but they seem to cover everything.  You'll probably want paper worksheets or another app to practice your writing, though.  There are three ways in which I can see the app being improved.  If the devs improve it in the first two ways I suggest, I'll add a star to my rating.  First, a method for saving progress across devices would be ideal.  Like many people, I use multiple devices, but there is no apparent way to move progress stats between them.  Either a cloud save option or ability to export/import progress would work.  Second, please support portrait mode.  Landscape mode is fine for tablets, but when I'm using the app on the go, such as on public transit, it's inconvenient to use it two-handed.

But Human Japanese is the at the middle of everything I'm doing, because right from the introduction I knew that it wasn't just going to throw words and phrases at me and hope that I'd eventually get it, but it was going to take its time to explain why things are like they are, and get into the guts of the language.   Vocabulary is important, and so far HJ has thrown a fair bit at me, but it's nothing if you're not learning the inner workings of a language such that you will be able to use it for your own needs. I like that HJ doesn't overwhelm with vocabulary, and switches up between learning words, grammar, cultural notes and other things so that you're never stuck on one thing for too long.  That said, while HJ is at the middle of what I'm doing, I probably wouldn't recommend it on its own. It has a few games and quizzes to test your memory and speed at remembering things, but it's better at explaining than testing.  So in order to memorise I supplement with other apps, flashcards and so on, and once I have more of the fundamentals I'm sure I will use other apps to expand my vocab too.",5,2,3.1.3,2017-01-08 18:41:35,,

For me I love to see Japanese sentence with Kanji. It's beautiful to see three of them together in one sentences.  I take serious of every example sentences you provide. I hear it, mimic it and write it. Whenever I will have finished Human Japanese Intermediate, Ill back to the start and Ill  be happy to see Kanji and it's time to be serious with them.
