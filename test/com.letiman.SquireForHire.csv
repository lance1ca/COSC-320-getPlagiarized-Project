Love the simplicity in rules but variation in each game. The flavor text is great too. One question though, is there a way to see high scores? That would be nice, although I'm scared to see how many games I've played already ðŸ˜‚",5,0,1.3.51,2021-01-08 15:37:17,,

For having to pay for a game upfront without testing to see if it's worth it. Your not making the cut. I could waist the time to figure out what the hell is going on. But there's a lot of OTHER games that are explained well upfront before any purchases. So I'd consider this game to be hostile for this reason.,1,3,1.3.51,2020-12-04 13:33:47,,

It could use better instructions perhaps with illustrations to better show the finer points of scoring. Item adjacency was a bit of a puzzle also(for a while I thought it had to just be the same color item) and it took me a while to understand exactly when you could place a card. A feature that would be nice is to be able and choose the other card if you made a mistake selecting the right one to place.I backed the Kickstarter for this and look forward to it.",5,3,0.2.50,2020-10-06 16:56:42,,

Some of the controls are a bit fiddley (mostly switching back and forth between the adventure card and the backpack), and it could really use a back button In case you accidentally tap on the wrong loot card, but none of that really interferes with the fun.",4,3,0.2.50,2020-10-05 15:31:46,,
