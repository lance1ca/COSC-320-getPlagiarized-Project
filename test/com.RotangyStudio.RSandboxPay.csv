Trying to line up props is clunky. The guns are cool. The physics are wierd when it comes to player movement will get stuck on pebbles and drift backwards the longer you live. Its a great start. I love the material tool. I wish you could use the color tool to make them brighter or save colors. It just needs to overhaul new props, new lootboxes, a tool to duplicate over one for block props, and a way for us to make and share props and skins.",3,0,1.29,2021-02-07 18:41:09,,
