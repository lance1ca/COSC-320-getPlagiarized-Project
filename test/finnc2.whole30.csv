The date should include doing a 30 count down and being a food diary where you take pictures of your food and then list to help you track and it would be great if it allowed you to enter the approx. Amount of food and totaled the calories. Also if it let you do a modified version. So if you have a food allwrgy to avoid or if you have a specific food you need (like personally I have to have dairy for bone healing right now if you could say modify with (whole)dairy  or skim dairy etc. The recipe section just being instagram search was a huge disappointment 😕 My friend used an app for whole 30 a year ago.
