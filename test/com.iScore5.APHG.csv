The problem is that this app wasn't coded very well, and has quite a few bugs. This bugs stayed with the app the 3 months until my AP test. It's very easy to crash the app and randomly sometimes random buttons won't work when you tap them, not to mention the color choice is just bad. White on orange looks okay, but can get very difficult to read, and hard to see after awhile. Being a programmer myself I find this very sad.",2,1,,2020-09-30 16:20:48,,
