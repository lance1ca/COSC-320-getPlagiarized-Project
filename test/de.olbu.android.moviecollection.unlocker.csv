It' isn't what it use to be. I updated app recently and now only 3 of over 600 movies in my collection have images. Developer said previous images are no longer aloud. I can't even add one of the generic images aloud now to an existing movie in my collection in the app. It says it has been saved but doesn't. This means everything I have must be deleted and input again. What is the point of a backup file if you can't even update cover photos to it? Worthless!!!,1,48,1.4,2020-08-02 13:11:46,,

Im addition to that be able to add more than one film when you search a  film that has other films with similar titles rather than having to do a new search every time. Also something I would really love is if there could be an option for movies and wishlist where it can generate a film at random from your list.

I've found at least one show that is on themoviedb but the app can't find it (Sliders). I created a custom show in the app, but I can't add any seasons from there. Once you go into a show and it lists the seasons, it only lists one format for the seasons instead of all formats for each season, you have to go into each season individually to see what formats are owned.

Especially comparing to Movie Maker Pro.  I really like MMPro however, from what I couldn't find, you can't create your own categories nor couldn't you edit most of the fields of the imported movie.  With Movie Collection, you can practically edit almost everything.. All fields, name, categories, wish list, media, etc.  and that was the ONE thing I needed.  It's also easy to navigate.  When doing a filter search it's one click, drag to your category and view.  Adding categories, just edit the current categories, put one of your own and it's automatically remembered for the next time.   All in all a great product, my only issue after 2 days of use is the categories imported aren't always correct..  Example.. Find a clearly romantic comedy and it would only import as a comedy at times.. Other than that, 4 stars for now..

I have it on my tablet at home to scroll through our collection to find something to watch without having to look through our actually collection.  I also have it on my phone so when I'm out buying movies, I can check to see if I already have it so I don't buy the same movie twice.  The only things I'd like to see added is the ability to mark each movie as 'watched' if you've watched it already as well as the ability to rate it on your own device.  Then, when you're looking for something to watch, you'll know if you've already seen it.  And if you're interested in watching something again, you can pick something you already know you liked or use your ratings to advise friends.
