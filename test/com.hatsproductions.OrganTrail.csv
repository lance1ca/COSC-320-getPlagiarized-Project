The biggest issue I ran into here was the rediculous rate that bad things happen. Upon starting my playthrough, one of my party members was instantly bitten, meaning that the rest of the run was extremely difficult. Along with that, I constantly had party members losing up to four fuel cans at a time. This meant that I not only lost dozens of fuel cans, but also all of the items I sold or traded in order to aquire them, which eventually killed my party in the end. I also came into an issue where party members would constantly choose to stretch their legs or stop to look at scenery, all the while being out of food and consequentially starving. I really think this game would be five stars all around if the devs made a quick final pass over it and really polished it up. In its current state I can recommend the base game, but would not recommend sinking any more money than that into it, merely because repeatedly playing on normal is boring, and playing on the hardest difficulty is unfortunately unbalanced and luck-based.",3,3,2.0.5,2018-09-19 17:22:26,,

I feel like it's important to hint at the fact that reaching the safe haven doesn't automatically mean you're safe. The twist is great but I was not prepared at all because my playstyle was scavenging at low horde times and avoiding fighting at all costs because of how janky the controls are. Therefore I didn't stock up on ammo. I feel the shooting controls also need some serious reevaluation. The drag and shoot may work on a PC but not on mobile. It's too difficult on such a small screen. It took me three hours of straight playing to get through my first run and successfully saving all of my party only to be hopelessly murdered at the end. That's not compelling for me to try again nor is it very fair. You need to plant a Chekhov's gun or something early on. Give me a warning that ammo will be necessary at the very end and then let me choose whether or not to heed it.

Bravo, devs! This is way more fun and has far more replay value than Oregan Trail. Plus, it makes me feel almost as nostalgic as Stranger Things does. 😉 Game play is pretty in-depth and it requires quite a bit of strategy. I'd be embarrassed to say how many hours I've spent playing this in the last week, and I still haven't won a game. That's a good thing!! Like I said earlier, crazy high replay value and great strategy elements. I think I owned this less than 24 hours before I purchased both game add-ons, and they are sooooooo worth it! And also very affordable, especially when you think about how much content they add that enriches the game.   Graphics are badass, 100% 80's but better of course. Music rocks. 4 difficulty levels. One of the add-ons lets you choose between different routes - very cool feature! The shooting controls are actually much easier once I got used to them... I love the jobs that involve shooting bandits, so much fun!   You can probably already tell from this enthusiastic, book-sized review... but this is my favorite phone game ever.

Organ Trail offers a minimalist, yet captivating story due to its retro arcade aesthetic, dark humour and beautiful (yet sometimes chilling) score by Ben Crossbones, which I can't give enough credit to.   It's a very basic game, but its style and its story's ability to grasp the attention of the player make it a must. It's a game that requires an imagination in order to play, so if you don't get involved with the story it won't be half as good.   There's not many games that I'd spend a cent on, but Organ Trail is one that offers plenty in return for the price. There's enough there to entertain over and over again.   It also helps greatly that with each update Organ Trail adds more to the experience. Additions such as 'Clement's Quest' allow for more ways to enjoy the game.   There's not much wrong with it, except for some people it won't be worth playing many times after the story has been completed. I personally could play it many times after that, but even so I think that the game should be made longer and more additions like 'Clement's Quest' should be implemented.   All that being said it's a game worthy of five stars and I would recommend the game to anyone who enjoys a good retro arcade vibe and a zombie story packed with humour and pop culture references.   I can't wait to see what they'll add to it next (that's a hint developers)!",5,0,2.0.4,2017-09-05 13:25:21,,

You don't get want you want when you choose a destination, the upgrades change and the bugs suck all the fun out of the game. I regret giving the developers money because they're not fixing the game. Don't pay for it.",1,0,2.0.4,2017-05-27 20:51:22,,

I do like the concept of a zombie version of a childhood game, it looks okay, but after playing it, it started to annoy me.  I don't like that when we're driving along events will pop up every couple of seconds, usually telling me that my team and I are incompetant survivors. It gets annoying after awhile.  I did like that we started with a priest, but unlike later on for other characters, we aren't given the option to NOT shoot him. I think the menu for when we're in a town could be improved. Like the trade button should be next to the sell and buy buttons.  And I think there shouldn't be a mini-game for repairing a vehicle, it feels unfair if we suck at it. And this one confused me for abit, when we're on the rest options, you should change ""done"" to ""exit"". ""Done"" usually means it applied the options, not exiting the menu.",1,8,2.0.4,2015-12-25 15:54:08,,

But the big problem I have is that when you scavenge, all your controls are inverted and its impossible to aim to save your life. Trying to walk and then aim is impossible because your main guy will just start walking again in the direction of the zombie you're trying to shoot. I noticed that when I rested my crew that my main guy wouldn't gain any health - is this a glitch? Only medkits would fill his life. So it became very difficult to play when I had to begin focusing on his health only and the need to scavenge at the same time, remember scavenging is a huge part of playing this and everything is weighted on 1 character, why cant I have another person in my party scavenge?   Please implement alternate controls for scavenging!",4,2,1.6.6.3,2014-10-12 01:59:08,,

However one aspect of the survival horror experience that needs adapting party members need to be more interactive in the field say in gunfights for example bring one member out on the hunt they waste ammo save your life and die in a gruesome splattered of pixels, the members left at the wagon are raided by thieving little thieving thiefs supplies are stolen and they are ""left 2 die"" just evil, eh?

Also on the Safe Haven boss gauntlet I was swarmed at the front of my van (with full party) and they didn't do anything about it and I insta lost all my lives, effectively ruining my entire progress in just a few short seconds. Not cool!  Also the app needs to to be setup to override screen timer. Its really annoying to constantly keep the screen on (by tapping) when I'm reading something and usually by tapping you wind up ""hitting continue"" and miss out on what you wanted to read.

The controls for shooting are terrible, you pull back to shoot and move your finger to aim, but never in the direction you want to shoot, no, it's more like the opposite but even that would be simple so it's a little more complicated than that. This makes the gun horribly inaccurate, slow, and difficult to fire standing still (as tapping the screen makes you move, so often times you move towards what you're shooting at). Over all the gun feels more like a slingshot. The controls are so bad that I'm almost positive this was their goal, to make the game handle just as bad as the original (quite a feat for a touch screen interface). How is that a good idea? And there are no prompts if you accidentally hit back and leave a town before getting supplies, which can REALLY screw you over, especially later on in the game. And being bugged to log in/sign up for their scoring site is incredibly annoying, to my knowledge there is no way to disable this but I haven't spent much time looking.

The music and artwork are outstanding.  The controls are pretty good, but the shooting and scavenging can be a bit tricky at times.  The gameplay is dark and morbid, with some exciting twists on the ""stops along the way"".  The game is long very challenging.  Even on the easy setting it's near impossible to keep people and cars in decent condition.  Unless there is a better starting formula to use for supplies, I'm struggling to get to SLC.  It all comes down to how well you can find supplies and get lucky along the way.    Some nagging things:    I think more cash and or supplies should be available from jobs and scavenging.  Its nearly impossible to keep any supplies near the end of the trail.    Sometimes events will happen near the entrance of a new place and it prevents me from being able to stop there. Not sure if this is a bug or what.  Why doesn't the main character benefit from rest? Doesn't make sense.  Big issue with the scoring...Why isn't the distance traveled taken into account?  You could just die right at the start and get a great score.",4,0,1.0,2012-08-12 17:50:39,,
