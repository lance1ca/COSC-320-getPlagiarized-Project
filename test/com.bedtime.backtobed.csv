A nice twist of the puzzle platform genre.  Plays great on my NVIDIA SHIELD with full controller support.  This is a must have for any Android gamer!,5,2,1.0.2,2014-09-01 21:47:07,,

Unfortunately it CONSTANTLY stutters from loading screen to actual game play. I haven't come across a game that does this yet!!,2,3,1.0.2,2014-08-31 17:12:12,,

Edit: I'd only played the first 12 levels when I wrote that, the later levels do interesting stuff with perspective, so I revised up a star. Still not the most amazing puzzles, but all around a cool game.",4,3,1.0.2,2014-08-30 07:48:22,,

Controls are alright too. I have a Nyko PlayPad which sadly doesn't work with the game on my Nexus 7. The direction pad moves the character but none of the buttons is able to initiate the carry action.,4,1,1.0.2,2014-08-29 03:30:36,,
