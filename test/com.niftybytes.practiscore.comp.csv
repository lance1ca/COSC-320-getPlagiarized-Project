The ability to edit your scores for ""theoretical outcomes"" is a thing of beauty. That said, while I'm slowly getting used to it, I still find the app very counter-intuitive and difficult to use. For example: to search for a match I have to undo all my match edits (even if I didn't make any, to go back to the original overall results), go to ""change match"", ""search"", and then ""my first match"" - which makes no sense to me and it took me a while to figure out. Especially irritating and unusual (for a droid) is the fact that the ""back"" button closes the app, instead of just taking you back to the previous screen. Other than being in desperate need of a UI overhaul (the sole reason for only 3 stars) this app has provided an answer to a lot of wants, needs, and ""wouldn't it be cool if...""'s. Great job guys!
