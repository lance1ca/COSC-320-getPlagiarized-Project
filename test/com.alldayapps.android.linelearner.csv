There are so many bugs in this which helps me understand why they do not provide a demo or lite version. 1) Unable to select from pull down menu when it is open but has been moved to the background. Must use recent. 2) Shuts off after a few minutes of the screen being off. I have it set like other apps to remain on even if the screen is off but it doesn't. What makes this even more frustrating is that it goes back to the first line for that session and not the place where it stopped. 3) Beginning of lines is sometimes cut off. 4) The interface is awkward to use and some features show up in one place but not another. 5) 11/18/15 - I tried to exit but it kept playing in the background. I started it again and assumed that when I pressed play it would start playing that and stop the other one. Now it played both.  The only positive is that you can record individual lines and play them back in various ways. I should have followed my normal plan of avoiding apps with very few installed.

I work by recording all lines of text in monotone and replaying to learn by rote with voice memos.  I have always wanted to be able to silence out my own lines in the recording to fill them in myself and this app does it!  And when you forget your line, you hit “Prompt” (could say ‘Line?!’, like how an actor calls out) and it plays your next line.  Boom.  It can even be set to play your line AFTER a pause of same length, so you can double-check.  It’s functionally exactly what I was looking for.  I docked a star because I find the interface somewhat confusing (and unattractive on Android v. iOS) and the workflow for editing not intuitive (not being able to playback/preview a line in the editing page, for example, when we don’t know line numbers).  I expect this app to develop  beautifully with feedback and as the word spreads. It’s basically having a scene reader in your pocket.  You could even record with the other actors for extra fancy times.",4,1,1.6,2014-02-21 11:42:45,,

It would be much more fluid if we mess up a line during a recording, if we could just long press the line entry to go into the edit screen, once done, let us back out to the recording list again where we we're so we can just continue.  With the way it is now, I have to leave the recording list, to go into the edit list, scroll down ( often accidentally deleting or moving and entry in the process)   then press the correct line to edit to get to the point of rerecording a line.  At the very least it would be nice to have a conformation on deleting a line.  Thanks for your efforts, each version is getting better...thanks for the menu when going ""back""",3,3,1.5,2013-10-11 17:40:54,"Hi Jonas,
Thank you for the feedback. There is now a new version of the app, which was a complete re-write, and answers your issues.  I hope you find it useful.

A little finicky, but still really useful. I no longer have an iOS device, and so went looking for something like this.. and here it is! I haven't used it much yet, on my phone, but here is a little feedback from the little I have used it so far:  Non-functioning back button... sucks. Even if back took you to the menu screen... it is such an instinctual action for me.  I am a little nervous as the ""Instructions"" mentions that the Android version isn't as feature rich as the iOS.   Still...
