You don't need photorealism or heavy 3D graphics to create something excellent, coherent and engaging as this little game is. I beg Avokiddo to seriously consider a Thinkrolls Space sequel, by continuing in exactly the same direction and with the same team that developed and designed this marvelous game.",5,3,1.0.1,2020-12-28 14:35:38,,
