There are however some problems with this port.  The typeface was poorly chosen. Every g, j, p, q, and y are formatted so that the descenders (the part of a letter that hangs below the line) is in line with normal characters. It makes the lowercase characters look like they're capitalized in random spots like a ransom note.  There are also little lines in the character sprites that are hard to ignore. They look like little cuts in the graphics.  All that aside, FFII has a unique combat and leveling system that I truly enjoy.",3,3,5.01,2017-11-26 14:38:31,,

Bonus features after completing the game. Well worth it.   Cons:  I have experienced crashes during the game, I often have to reboot to prevent it. No map existing in game- Can be hard to navigate No cloud save- Easy to lose your progress if you were to uninstall and reinstall  Be careful of purchasing- Decide whether it's compatible because this game is missing cloud  So far, I prefer playing the first final fantasy over this one. It can get boring until the final boss scene and the bonus games. However, I wouldn't play this game again after the first time as it isn't that enjoyable.",5,49,5.01,2017-07-06 08:39:50,,

There seems to be some lag issues with events and conversations with shops.  The movement cursor is awkward still...  This version is MUCH better than the Android port of Final Fantasy 1; while FF1 did not contain any of the bonus GBA content, this version does contain the Rebirth content.  The removal of that content of FF1 is a strange, strange decision on Square's part.  :/  It greatly extends the life of the game, so while I'm glad THIS game has the bonus content, THEY NEED TO FIX FF1.",4,2,5.00,2017-01-02 06:26:20,,

Spells can be single-target or cast on a whole group. The removal of the class system means you can build your characters however you want, just by playing them the way you'd want to play them.  There are some pain points too though. In the opening area, if you head in the wrong direction you'll find yourself fighting monsters that can kill you in one shot. Once the party all dies, you can resume your game, but unlike in FF1 you'll only get to take 1 step before a battle starts.. meaning you'll find yourself in this endless cycle where you're forced to load from a save point or start over. Save your game in a bad area? Start the game over again! Be super careful where you save!  There's also a technical problem in the character menus (magic, status, etc).. On my Nexus 6, the left/right arrow buttons are extremely sensitive and even trying to press the button as quick as I can results in a long enough press that it moves at least twice. With a max of 4 characters, supporting a long press on these buttons seems unnecessary to begin with.",3,62,5.00,2016-03-01 04:50:13,,

This is a pretty darn nice game if you can put up with some rather weird design choices in the battle system compared to the rest of the series.  But do be wary that the screen resolution may seem tiny on some phones (like my Galaxy S4 Mini), and the text doesn't scale either. Aside from that, pressing the back button with some devices instantly causes this game to crash, and selecting multiple enemies in combat when casting spells seems nigh impossible to get right. Unlike Final Fantasy I's gigantic pop-up directional pad, though, this game has a static one that's always in the same spot, albeit still kind of big but perfectly usable.  A good game, but for some apparent flaws I'm definitely gonna have to pull off a few stars because they may make it difficult to enjoy or even play this particular port for the Android system. And I do mean this, because it seems that after a few updates they just left this game in the state it is for the system; and thus I'll comment on this as the definitive product. A worthy alternative would be the Sony PSP re-release, which is basically identical to this but without the weird crashes and navigation issues.",3,1,,2015-08-27 14:35:04,,
