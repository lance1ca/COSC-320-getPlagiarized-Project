I can only say 3 stars because when there are letter sounds there are 'uhs' after them, which is not good educationally. Some word sounds, such as using ""am"" and 'an' and then saying each sound seperately are also not appropriate. When there is spelling I would love to hear letter sounds not letter names as the kids touch each letter and then it reads it back to you. It would be nice if you could increase and decrease the speed of the sight word and letter matching as the words fly by. The word rhyming (make a path) is visually overwhelming. It also goes to the loading screen too often (monkey stone with light that goes around it).
