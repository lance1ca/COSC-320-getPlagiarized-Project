In that it moved it from being a 'drudge' (in my headspace) to one of 'maintenance'. Just as how you can take twenty minutes in the morning to get ready, you can do that for your house too. Or, there's the option of a five minute random task, to see how much you can get done in five minutes- you'd be surprised how much can be done in five minutes! In twenty minutes, I have half the house done (swept, wiped down and dusted).  In the first day of getting the app, I managed to clear a desk that had six years of make up samples, papers, books (I'm talking geological layers, people).   The only drawback is that when you try to do long term lists (the first option of things to do, high priority to low), the application freezes and you need to force close.   Overall though, this is the app to get if you're overwhelmed by the thought of housework. Download the app, do a random five minute challenge (your computer desk, tidy your bed), and feel you attitude towards housework change.
