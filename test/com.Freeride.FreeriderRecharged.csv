To me not worth it at all and the free freerider is so much better and smoother.😠 But luckily they have a refund!😁😁😁😁,1,5,1.2,2019-10-26 22:08:12,"You can try the latest update and see if it runs better - SSAO is now turned off by default, it was a major performance hog. Selecting low resolution and lowest graphics quality in the main menu gives the best performance. Also, I recommend enabling Performance Mode (or similar feature) in your phone settings for better performance.",2019-11-13 05:03:52
