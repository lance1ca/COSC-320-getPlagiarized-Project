I have found Hardwood to be the best on line euchre for androids but it is extremely frustrating. I have lost 16 or more games in a row - more than once - simply due to very poor app programming. It is not statistically valid to have a combo of 3 nines or tens and one or two Queens for 16 games in a row but Hardwood sets you up for failure unless you are one of their ""chosen ones"".  I don't know how to become one of their favorites (except by cheating - which I am told is very easy on Hardwood using ""foom"" signals - so try to avoid people that consistently play with the same partner). When the programmers' avatars are at the table, (and I don't mean the robots) you see some impossible combos (3 loners in a row for several games in a row). You'd think they'd get bored! Unlike Yahoo, Hardwood manipulates the cards so you can't go below a certain rating.  I would prefer more balance in the card programming and less interference from the Hardwood people.
