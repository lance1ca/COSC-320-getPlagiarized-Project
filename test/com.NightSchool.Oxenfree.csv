This is genre defining and nothing short of a masterpiece. It not just sets the bar for click and point adventure games but i believe heralds a quiet and triumphant resurgence. The game's flow reminds me of another recent masterpiece ""Life is Strange"", but in my humble opinion it does much more with much less. Usually with the horror genre it is all too easy to overplay your hand and end up with kitsch. But Oxenfree maintains a steady hand on the throttle all throughout, never giving away too much or too little, with just enough out of reach to keep you going. And I could go on. The beautiful minimalist artwork, the absolutely gorgeous music. And the dialogue was so smooth and organic I genuinely kept getting sucked into the banter. My advice is to just play it. It's worth the small expenditure.

I love the choose your own adventure and the options that you get. It provides you with multiple play throughs and a different experience every time. I love that aspect.   I have to admit that the dialouge was a little wonky and a bit awkward at times. But that is a small gripe and not really worthy of knocking the scoring down by a full star.  The reason for the 4 star ranking is that the game is rather slow, even though it kept me interested. There were quite a few bugs were I had to restart the game. And where the game  ""saved"" always cause for a lot more backtracking than I would like, I mean like 20 minutes worth at least. Despite all of this the game is responsibly prices at 5 dollars and I do find myself playing when I have the time. It's just because of those issues, I'm more inclined to complete the game in one sitting rather than play when I can.",4,1,2.5.8,2017-09-20 03:30:39,,

I think this game also has different endings depending on the choices I made but I don't think I'll go through the game again because...  2. the loading time is unbearable. 20 seconds for each scene is forever in a mobile game. I actually dozed off trying to wait for a scene to load. so this isn't a game I can just pick up and go. I would akin the game to reading a book while I'm in commute but it's impossible because of the excruciating load times. if the developers can make the load times at 5 seconds max, I bet the game would be an even more awesome experience.   it is a fantastic journey, this game. the load time sucks is all. or maybe Android isn't a good gaming platform.   *played on a Nexus 6p",3,1,2.5.8,2017-08-07 05:45:59,,
