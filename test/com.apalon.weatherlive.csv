The developers got in touch with me regarding inaccurate weather forecasts given through this app. Keep in mind the app itself is great but a weather app is only as good as the source of weather information that it is connected to. There are several different sources of weather information and the one that they have for my area of the Treasure Coast of Florida is absolutely the pits. I can't tell you the number of times I have stopped plans to get together with people either on a boat or motorcycle, based on a forecast one or two days ahead that turns out to be completely different on the day of the get together. Unfortunately, by that time it's too late. I am uninstalling and looking for another weather app. As a retired commercial pilot, weather is a very important part of my life and because we are Outdoors so much, it is an important part of my social planning.

First, the location is always completely inaccurate, to the order of at least 100 miles. This is despite the app using the most aggressive location service settings. A knock-on problem of the location setting is then the vastly increased battery drain compared to similar apps (usage monitor confirms this). The real crux of the utter failure of this app is the poor accuracy of the actual weather forecast. Temperature reports from this app are frequently wrong to the order of 5 or 6 degrees C, at best it is 3 deg C wrong. This is compared with the BBC app, the official UK Met Office app, and a variety of highly regarded independent apps using either official Met Office data, Foreca data (and others).

I want a Google Play refund!!!! If I could attach the screen shots showing the view from both apps I would.  As of 11/02/2017, I am uninstalling this app & would appreciate  a refund. This WAS an amazing app but it isn't anymore. The final nail in this app' coffin was when it displayed my location as the whole state of Utah. The developer obviously did not read my last review because he had the nerve to ask me to give him suggestions for improvement so obviously he didn't read my review BEFORE he messaged me!!! AGAIN, I WANT A FULL REFUND because I haven't recieved the service I PAID for in 6 months!!  I found & started using this app when it was one of Amazon's Underground Free apps. I loved it so much that I bought it on Google Play when it was no longer free on Amazon Underground. I am extremely disappointed because this app rarely works anymore.  I'm fed up with the Error Code telling me that it can no longer detect my location. This WAS a 5 star app but now it's below a 1 star app. 2) 10/14/2018 I uninstalled & reinstalled this app 2 days ago when I was out of town. I came home late last night & when I  checked the weather,  my location HAS NOT CHANGED on the widget & my THE WEATHER DATA IS BLANK on the app except for the city I was in yesterday. Today, I noticed that this app as been ""IMPROVED"" on the app store & if that mean I have to uninstall & reinstall this app every time my location changes, the ""IDIOT"" that made the changes has NO CLUE WHAT ""IMPROVED"" means & needs to look look the definition up in the dictionary.

I'm not going to be too critical though as weather forecasting is more a science - less an art. No-one gets it right 100% of the time! I have seen the dev mention ""Report weather"" functionality but I have yet to see this function available? I've looked all over the app - perhaps my version of Android doesn't support this? The only other critique I can make is the startup of the app seems clunky - in that upon device bootup, the app loads - then goes blank - flashes a bit and then finally pops up correctly. Does this EVERY time. It's more likely my device but no other app I have suffers like this.

Widgets work very well and is updated. I would like to recommend that it would be nice to enable both home and lock screen features. When my phone is in the lock screen mode, it would be nice to see the full weather information as I would in full, opened app mode. A simple tap on the screen should direct the user to unlock the phone or provide other options to the user's choice: launch to clock, launch to weather, etc.  I like the flexibility of using the choice of which clock to use (system clock or an in app purchase). I use Timely as my default clock for my choice of widget for the home screen.  **Update 2017-10-03**  App crashes constantly when attempting to share weather information by clicking on the top right share icon. The app brings up several sharing options (messenger, Facebook, etc). When I click on other apps to use Google messenger, it crashes.  I had one experience where it had confused my location as Texas.  Ultimately, the weather app is not as robust and stable for what I paid for.",3,0,5.2,2017-11-03 05:32:51,We appreciate if you could contact our support service (support@apalon.com) with a more detailed description of the issue so that we could try to resolve it for you.

I would recommend Weather Live guys piggy back off the same servers as them, because their numbers are dead on.....Great looking interface, but consistently provides inaccurate data. Reply to Dev: I have been reporting, but it's the temperature and forecast temps that have been way off. Doing a simple local Google weather search delivers a huge discrepancy in forecasts, Weather Live always off by several degrees, up to almost 10 degrees from actual weather. Had to downgrade the 2 stars because no improvements have been made, defeats the purpose of having a weather app if the information is almost always wrong. Update: No choice but to 1 star this app because clearly it won't be fixed. Will be uninstalling once I find a suitable replacement. Disappointed because Weather Live had a lot to offer.",1,1,5.2,2017-10-25 09:52:43,We appreciate if you could contact our support service (support@apalon.com) with a more detailed description of the issue so that we could try to resolve it for you.

Specially today's forecast in Portsmouth United Kingdom when I checked it yesterday it said it's going to be sunny day it's still shows it's a sunny day today however it's cloudy and rainy here. So giving false weather forecast.  Please correct this and i will give 5 star rating back. may be you need to change weather data provider to get accurate data,2,1,5.2,2017-10-25 00:36:12,"We would like to provide more precise data for our users so in case you are facing weather inaccuracies please let us know weather details for the selected location.

Annnnnd, that's what got it the second star in this review, design and concept.   The weather forecasts are consistent, consistently dead wrong.   While at home his morning, it said that it was overcast outside with rain throughout tomorrow. There isn't a cloud in the sky here. It also says it's 86¬∞ F by my tracked location, but 90¬∞F by my saved location, which are each the same place right now. I wouldn't bother mentioning this if it were off by 1-2¬∞, but 4¬∞ is pretty steep for a weather app.   They've added a ""Report Weather"" function, but I use weather apps to have the weather reported to me, not the other way around. I'm embarrassed to say that I paid for this. I would have been better off setting that money on fire to stifle the odors from my toddler's fecal matter. I even canceled a cookout a day in advance because it forecasted pouring rain. I'm sure you can imagine what didn't happen; that's right, the cookout nor the rain.   If you want a pretty app that looks like a weather app, but don't actually care about the weather, this is the app for you.

When it comes to rain alerts I still have relied on my trusty Weather Channel app. I do love the way this one looks and functions however it seems to not be the best at describing things or forecasting accurately.,3,6,5.2,2017-05-25 06:08:33,Thanks for your feedback.

It has pseudo-hourly forecast (every 3 hours) for the upcoming 24 hours or so.  It packs a lot of information onto one screen which I think is the best thing about the app.  If I could add one feature it would be to drill down into the hourly forecast and see the chance of precipitation at a given time during the day.  For the functionality and presentation I give the app 3 stars.  I would give it more, but it seems to cause blocking in my system UI.  I have narrowed it down to this app that is the culprit.  When I unlock my screen, I often can't do anything for 1-3 second, presumably while my widget updates the temperature.  I considered knocking the score down to 2 stars for this - it's really egregious.  Even after paying for the app I want to stop using it.   Devs, please fix this!

I don't *think* I regret paying for the ad free version. That said, sometimes the app seems to lose its grip on the wind's direction and the compass needle then defaults to due north (where it goes when wind speed = 0), when really there is mighty wind (or gentle breeze) from, say, WNW. Also, how can the Feels Like reading be lower than the raw temp when the wind speed actually IS zero? But, all in all, great app design.

Good at that price. Widgets will not resize to full width of screen using Nova Launcher (others, too?) so that was a disappointment. Radar precipitation looses resolution when zoomed, and animated radar can get stuck requiring additional taps to get it to play the complete animation.  That said, it is a BEAUTIFUL weather app and should delight many who are weather fanatics like me. Would love to see a fully featured Wx Radar widget that could be resized to accommodate any home screen layout. Would not (should not) have to animate as long as it updates upon wake and a tap takes you to the full app's radar. Should have zoom & pan during initial widget setup, but remain locked at those settings in the final widget.",4,0,3.4,2015-01-01 09:06:50,,

While the Kindle Fire version allows me to use the app in either portrait or landscape mode, the Google Play version does not (at least not on my devices - yours may vary).   3. For a paid app, bugs me way to much to purchase other Apalon apps.  Once these quirks have been ""fixed"" or ""corrected"" I may reconsider updating to 4 or even 5 stars!

What would make this the best is if the rain was really rain not a wallpaper moving back in forth. Its rainy where I am and that's what came up after install. Plus and maybe I didn't mess with it long enough but my wallpaper kept switching from night rain to dawn rain. Its 10 pm so its dark out not dawn. Fix the wallpaper and I'll be back the. It will be worth the 2.99. Id proly pay 5.99 for a good weather app with real looking live weather wallpaper.,3,0,2.1,2014-04-20 19:50:54,Thank you for your feedback.
