I bought the full kit from aliexpress for 5m 60 per meter and find it is very stuttering in its transitions. I have 262 led's and it just isn't happy.   Could I request a feature to ignore every other led to increase performance. I.e. just address every other one? For the single colour option, its great to address all but it really suffers with all 262. As a test, i changed the horizontal and vertical led numbers to trick it into using half and whilst naturally the alignment was wrong, the performance was perfect.",4,5,1.0.2,2019-04-05 07:37:09,,

One question though, can you lower the intensity of the lights when using the ""single color mode""? No matter which level I change to in ""Color Brightness"", the brightness stays the same, which is full. It does work when level is changed in the ""screen capture mode"".

I tried the solid colour setting and but the LEDS in to the correct order. I then tried the lights in twinkle mode and all was good, it was looking really promising so I moved on to the next step and selected screen capture... again all seemed to be going well! until I opened up netflix and all of the lights went out, next I tried it on normal digital tv, again the lights went out :(  It appears that what you end up with is a fancy control to make pretty patterns around the screen but not actually an ambilight for watching films and tv etc.  If by some chance the programmer comes back to me and can advise what the problem is and get if fixed then my rating will be changed, for now its next to useless for me on my Sony Bravia Android TV (which was selected from the list of devices on playstore so should be compatible)  UPDATE the programer has commented below that the application is not really designed to do what I need, if you are looking for something for third party integration it could be fine for you.",3,3,1.0.2,2018-12-21 02:41:02,"I am sure that you have collected everything correctly.
