Again - we are waiting impatiently for page type layout. 3. Add more efects to speech bubles. Dizzyness. Glow. Shiny. Shaky. Need more emotions. 3. It would be great to have an opportunity to change places of photos in the grid. Cause when you look for the whole picture, you sometimes need to change positions of the photos. 4. Some icons would be helpful. Bulb, Question mark, Lightning. Emojis... 5. Picture in picture. That could be really cool. To have other photos inside. The best value can be to have photos in thoughts buble.  So much for now :) Thank you",5,18,1.6.15,2018-09-28 07:56:05,,

Previously the app had been protected, which I've always found to be an incredibly futile thing. But basically what that meant is that people like myself, who like to use backup apps to back up each version of any app on our device, were left without any way of doing so, short of rooting my device. I asked if the developer could remove the protection so I could update the app and back it up, and he not only did that, but he was extremely helpful and very friendly about doing it. This level of customer support that this developer provides, well it's what all Android developers should strive to achieve with their customers.
