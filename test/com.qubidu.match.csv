Teaches The basics of chess, some advanced things and chess with more to come per Maurice Ashley apparently. There are all kinds of puzzles inside of this app with friendly trash talking or humorous comments from Maurice Ashley voiced on the puzzles. There are three different levels of hardness to play chess against the built-in chess engine. That is easy medium and hard. Overall the graphics are really nice it is fun to play with!",5,2,,2021-01-13 20:34:04,,

It takes a long time for the moves on the board to catch up with the audio which is always ahead. This makes the training hard to follow. Also hitting pause or back key to go exit a tutorial takes almost half a minute to respond which is unacceptable. I'll give it 5 stars if these issues are fixed. No other concerns at this time.",3,3,1.0.2,2021-01-11 13:26:10,,
