I had been using MPDroid and latterly had switched almost all my listening to UPnP server and renderers.   Now running Debian Buster so re-enabled mpd and tried MAFA again.  I love that cover art is now supported natively, and that the client fully supports mpd's http streaming, including ability to pass the original stream to a 3rd party player.  I've tried MAFA on Nougat, Oreo and Pie.  My preferred player is Neutron Music Player (because I have a mix of 16-bit 44100 and ""Hi Res"" and some devices on which Neutron can give me bit perfect playback) and it all works *perfectly* on Pie on my Xperia XZ1 and on Nougat on my LG V20.  My Oreo Tablet doesn't have a good audio system but everything seems to work as well as can be expected while constrained by the default Android mixer.  I'm very pleased I tried the app again.  It is the first Android mpd client which betters MPDroid and is well worth the price.",5,1,mafa-1.2.2,2019-03-21 15:33:03,,
