In this app there were 2 options: take a picture through the app, or edit an existing picture in your gallery. The camera wouldn't take a picture with the blurred background like the portrait mode on iPhones, but you could add the blurry background after you took the picture. However, the blurred background was pretty fake looking because it didn't distinguish the object or person in the foreground very well, so it would blur the edges of the object or person that you don't want blurred. I may be too picky, but it looked poorly done to me. Obviously edited after the photo was taken. Then the app began to mess up immediately after being opened, requiring a force close. Not worth any amount of time or money to me.",1,16,,2017-10-22 20:45:01,"Hello Sarah Simpson, thank you for your helpful review. We have improved Phocus and fixed various bugs with the latest update.
