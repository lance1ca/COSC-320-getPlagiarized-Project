The control pad is a bit janky and I've had one time I got a Treasure Rush and couldn't go further than 2 rooms because the stairs were blocking the path (A Yes/No option would be nice for situations like that), but the game is fun and has a lot of charm. I've played both, and I personally like this one more than it's sequel. I'm not even typically into roguelikes, but I do have a love for RPG Maker, so I figured I'd try this one out, and I don't regret it at all.",4,0,1.5,2021-01-17 16:49:30,,

Hope they give a option to change the size of the buttons or spacing. Maybe a joystick layout would be good also,3,0,1.5,2021-01-16 13:49:38,,

Suddenly, though, buttons just don't work for no discernable reason making it impossible to play",3,3,1.5,2020-09-25 12:39:35,,

Thanks to the unlocked heroic difficulty and the new classes, unlocked through an in-game quest system, I can firmly say that the dungeon can be beaten at least 2/3 times before becoming repetitive, so we are talking about 16/24 hours. The developer is very keen and if you have any question about the game he is going to reply for sure. Buy it if you are a old school rpg fan.",5,2,1.5,2020-08-24 17:32:15,,

All of my games have stand-alone stories, but the overall story is better understood if played in this order: Knight Bewitched, Black Dungeon, Knight of Heaven, Knight Eternal. Let me know if you run into any problems with any of my games :)",2020-01-12 05:30:05
