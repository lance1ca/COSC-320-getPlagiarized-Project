Interestingly this version though starts with a personality quiz which I read wasn't in the original NES cartridge. Naming companions besides picking their jobs was a nice touch. FYI fleeing from a battle has a very low chance of success! 😧 Less so than any sequel I've played so far. The difficulty of this one, however, has calmed over the much agonized second DQ (a purchase I've decided to save for now after an abandoned emulator attempt 🙊 several months ago).

It has so-so SNES graphics, a skeleton of a plot, and the battles play out like a first-person, still-frame picture book with a little ticker at the bottom that tells you what's happening.  It doesn't help that the game is also outdated--this was originally released in the US in 1991 (when I was just 6 years old), and by today's standards it's super basic.  Further, if you do boot it up, you're going to have a heck of a time getting used to the controls.  Still, gosh darn it, the game is just a lot of fun to play.  The story, while certainly barebones, feels adventurous and fulfilling, even if the majority of the adventure is created by your random encounters.  Escaping the pyramid, waking the legendary giant bird, and falling to another world aren't compelling plot points, but they feel personal.  The game also has a sense of discovery that rivals modern games like The Witcher 3--even with the simplistic presentation, finding and looting towers is exciting and tense.
