I haven't even opened the app yet but I am finding that I can only download on one device per perchase. I feel like this is the miracle app at the point when all hope was lost but I purchased the app on my business phone and it installed on my device instead of my child's. I am not sure if this is an issue with Google or the app itself. I am rating with 4 stars for the time being, I can let her use it on my device if necessary.",4,9,2.0.0,2020-09-22 02:29:41,,

This new app is awesome! And I love the new update. My son loves to have it cheer for him after every line.,5,2,2.0.0,2020-09-17 07:09:48,,

But this last update is seriously great. I love I can keep the review sections up while we work through lessons. I love that I can now see the words without having to click through them. I also make flash cards so this was very helpful. Thank you easy peasy for all your hard word on a great curriculum!,5,9,2.0.0,2020-09-10 05:23:46,,

She started last week and can read all of the words through lesson 8. I love that I can finally get this on a second device. I am not sure how I feel about the newest update yet. Before I could hand the phone to my daughter and she could navigate the app on her own, but now I think she may end up moving lessons to the done list before completion. I am glad that there is an option to reset for this reason! So far Easy Peasy Homeschooling is a win from us",5,8,2.0.0,2020-09-07 07:33:09,,

Thank you! She loves the cheering sounds at the end of each lesson, too. I like that it is simple, not flashy, and not loud. Too many apps are just too much sensory overload for little kids, but this avoids that.",5,3,1.1.1,2020-08-28 06:29:22,,
