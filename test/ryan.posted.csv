That is very true, gasbuddy is a great app for finding discounted fuel, but it only works well because subscribers are disciplined to add and update the data, the same holds true here. The developer has done a great job with his ccw/reciprocity app, and over time, if we all do our part, this is one you will be glad you have it. A great app to research no-carry businesses, and call the establishment, ask for the manager and say: ""I was just planning to spend money at your business, but I just found out that you don't want to serve me"" He or she will definitely have their ears perked after that.",4,4,2.2.1,2013-05-27 17:38:25,,

I paid for this one from a recommendation of a friend, but if it wasn't for them I don't think I would have tried it just because it was not listed as free. I would like to see an option to ""try before you buy"", maybe give free accounts limited search area  (10 or 20 mile radius) and no ability to upload.  As far as the app it goes, I found some cases where the user input descriptions are hard to read. If the user inputs several lines of text that require it to be scrolled to be read, the entire display scrolls, not just the text box. Also would like the ability to click on the uploaded photos to be able to view them larger.  Other than that, I think this app has a lot of potential, and hopefully, creating a free version can entice more people to look into it and convert to a paid user.",4,1,2.2,2013-05-11 06:24:54,The app now has the functionality requested (to view larger size photos by clicking on them.)

It will be only as good as the people adding NFA businesses and gun friendly businesses.  Its only $0.99!!  Likes:  that I can look and get an idea who has a NFA posted or not and see alternatives.  depending on how descriptive the inputters get, you can easily see where the signs are posted.  Dislike:  every time you add a listing you have to input a usename and email address.  What I'd like to see:    1.  where I can sign in so it can automatically put an email address/user id/etc so I don't always need to input it. 2.  if places used to have a sign but no longer, we can see that it was listed as a NFA but is now gun friendly/etc. 3.  Different font or color for those required, right now it shows all the same color so I thought all were required until I just started hitting submit to see if I could get away with a blank space (lat/long, email/etc) 4.  sort of in correlation with #1, I'd like to see a laptop/desktop portal, so you can add/etc from your laptop and desktop and not just your smart phone.",4,2,2.2,2013-05-10 09:20:14,"Great feedback and suggestions!

It is purely dependent on the users to input pro/anti locations but there is no better way. Different states have different definitions for a location being legally posted and often times business are not posted properly. That is the great thing about the description field and image this app uses when people input information. This app works great and gives you all the information needed for whether a business is posted, is improperly posted, or not posted at all. That said it'd be nice to have a higher character limit for the description box.  The home screen is a bit cluttered feeling in the current version and searches take longer now but for good reason. The developer listened to his customers and added features/options that were requested and now has a very complete app. Cleaning up the home screen and speeding up searches would only be possible if he removed the new features that people wanted.  A word of advice when submitting information: take the picture first using your normal camera otherwise the app sometimes looses the one you took while in the app when entering other information.",5,4,2.2,2013-03-25 10:58:17,,
