One of my absolute favorites. As usual, the storyline, graphics, controls and gameplay are well done. Has a fast travel map and a journal. The length is adequate, as is the bonus chapter. No issues. I pray the next chapter is sooner than later, has Jimmy in it, as well as the usual cast of characters, and perhaps you could bring Michael into the fold. Make it a family affair.",5,2,1.0.1.837.118,2021-01-23 19:54:29,Hi Susan! Thank you for such a detailed review! We are sure it will be helpful for other customers.

I love all the Lost Lands, New York Mysteries and Legacy games. The frame for Lost Lands 7 is too large for my tablet. 1/22/21- Updated and everything fits. This episode of Lost Lands ties in characters from the first episode and gives some closure to the ""loss"" of an important character from episode 5. The puzzles in LL7 were not my favorites, but I am still going to replay it a million times as I have the past games. Best developer ever.",5,2,1.0.1.837.118,2021-01-22 13:37:12,"Hello!
