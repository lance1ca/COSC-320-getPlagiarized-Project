You should contact Snoman Gaming on YouTube and ask whether he can feature your game ;). My only gripes in this toadally awesome game are the lack of controller support and the missing feature to save the game's files on the phone's external storage. I'm also not sure whether the game supports cloud saving. I would really appreciate if you could add these features in the future :). P.s: there is a bug in 14-5 (the center square gets stuck at the wall and can't flip the switch).,5,24,1.7,2020-12-26 05:16:13,,
