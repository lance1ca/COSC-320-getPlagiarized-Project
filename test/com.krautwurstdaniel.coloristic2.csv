Game mechanics build upon each other in a satisfying way, difficulty level and curve is good. Graphics are simple but very polished with a warm color palette. Loved it",5,0,1.4,2020-11-29 12:08:55,,

This is the VERY style of game that I look for on Google Play. Minimalist, well designed, challenging but not frustrating, small download size and alot of fun to play. I always like to support indie developers.",5,2,1.4,2019-11-03 09:17:56,,

I bought it for my 90 year old grandmother, and she's way ahead of me already! (level 5-10!) Getting her a smartphone has changed her life, and clever games like this that require engaged thought, but are simple to control, are part of the reason for that. Thank you, developer! I'd also like to thank the developer here for not including microtransactions (an abhorrent practice) or ads. They'd have also both made the app totally unsuitable for my grandmother.",5,2,1.4,2019-10-25 10:26:20,,
