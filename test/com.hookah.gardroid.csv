Mimicing my beds by adding/subtracting tiles is not going to be as exact as I hoped. I was hoping to stay within one program, not needing to use a pdf file of my layout as well. I saw the feature of watering the bed but I was more thinking about setting up an alert for watering the bed. I need an alert that tell's me to water a specific area of the garden. I played around with it and filled a bed with Cauliflower and then noticed I can make a custom watering alert from within the plant, called it bed 1-5 drip. But then after I saved it, I can't find the custom alert anywhere to edit and it doesn't show up anywhere in the program. It is not in the alerts of the Cauliflower. I did it twice, saved it. Where is it? But what I really need is a specific alert connected to beds, not vegetables. An alert I can find easily and edit if necessary, depending on the season. Thanks for tweaking the program, I appreciate it but like I said I am still on the fence.

One question with garden beds though, if I use the fill option to add several plants in the garden , the bed menu still only reads as one plant. Is there a way to update to say, 16 plants without individually adding tomato 16 times and cluttering up the plants menu? Also, as the units are not representative of actual measurements (I am treating 1 square as a meter), there doesn't seem to be a way to account for smaller crops",4,4,1.15.3,2020-02-13 07:24:07,"Hi Dean, thanks for your review! Currently there is no way to have 16 plants in a bed and see them as one in the plants menu. I show it as one plant so you can easily water all those plants. The tiles in the Garden screen don't have a unit so you can use them however you like. One square meter, one row, etc. in order to give you more freedom.",2020-02-16 03:53:22

main critique of the app is around the UX. It just requires lots of tapping 
to get to helpful info. Like when viewing your vegetables, you're several 
taps away from the tips for the plant, and those are just little icons to 
show very basic information about it. If you want to see helpful tips, you 
need to navigate to a separate section, and that doesn't even include any 
extensive instruction. If this app just consolidated a lot of the features 
it has to be quicker to access, I would use it much more. When I have 
numerous vegetables in my garden, it takes up an annoying amount of time to

This app has been made with love. Thank you! Exactly what I needed. :)",5,2,1.2.0,2015-11-17 20:00:11,,
