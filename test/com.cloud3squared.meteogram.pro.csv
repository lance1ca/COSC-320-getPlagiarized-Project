But, there are a number of inconsistencies and hassles.  For example, the app defaults to metric and, there isn't a single setting to change all measurements at once.  What makes this worse is that when you import shared settings (other peoples ""cards""), it affects all settings, whereas certain settings should be immutable (like, metric or imperial measurements).  As stated in other reviews, the settings are numerous, but there is no settings' search to help you locate something specific, quickly.  Like I said, the app is getting there, but it hasn't quite arrived - the settings need to be tweaked a bit more.  There should be an easier way to import cards, too, for example.  Instead of importing and exporting all settings to share charts, the ""card"" idea should be further developed.  Again, not all settings should be affected when importing a chart.
