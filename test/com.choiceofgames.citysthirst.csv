Very good storytelling. Has good replay value as well. The only thing that kept it a 4 of 5 instead of 5 of 5 was the ending. I didn't like the way it ended. Feels like there was no conclusion. Still, it is definitely worth it in my opinion. But definitely play the 1st ""Deathless"" before purchasing this one. It is 100% free! And just as good!",4,1,1.0.6,2020-07-14 07:26:15,,

The story is excellent. The writing is top-notch. Exceptional replayability. So many different directions to go in this, support tyrants or fight tyrants, be evil or good. Tons of romance options. This particular story has so much possibility contained in such a small package. Some of the writing was downright poetic. Lets just say I really appreciate the effort the author put into this book. Highly recommend.",5,3,1.0.6,2020-03-29 15:46:01,,
