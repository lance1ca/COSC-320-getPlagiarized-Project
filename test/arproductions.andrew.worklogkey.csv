I'm guessing there is a setting that is slightly off that's causing that discrepancy. Can you double check your Wage setting, and also your Raise settings. If that wasn't the issue, you can email me at ARforAndroid@gmail.com with a screenshot and I'll be happy to help figure out what's happening.

I think you might be viewing the shifts as hours and decimals instead of hours and minutes. eg 7.25h is the same as 7 hours and 15 minutes. You can change the way hours are shown with the Hours Display option in the Job Settings. Feel free to email me at ARforAndroid@gmail.com if that doesn't help.

The times are based on a universal time stamp which is useful if you change time zones while in the middle of a shift, but isn't ideal when permanently changing time zones. I'm looking into addressing that in a future update. Although the times change, your total hours will always remain the same.

You can download Work Log Pro as many times as you'd like on as many devices as you'd like as long as you're using the same Google account. When you go to the Play Store you'll see the option to download instead of the price. Keep in mind, both Work Log Free and Pro must be installed.

I'm looking into adding more premium hours sections in a future update. In your situation, using the Holiday feature in the Wages section of the Job Settings may be what you need for public holidays. With it you can mark specific days to be paid at your holiday rate.

The Holiday Pay feature in the Wages section of the Job Settings lets you set a multiplier that will be applied to any shift you save as a holiday shift. This could potentially be used as a bonus feature. Another option is to use the Tips feature to add bonus pay.

Importing a database will always overwrite any shifts on your device. When changing phones be sure to restore the old database before adding new shifts, or those will be overwritten. All pay periods will be imported from the old database.

The premiums cannot overlap right now due to a technical restriction which I hope to address in a future update. You can still have overnight shifts count as premium by settings the times to 6pm-11:59pm, and the second time from midnight to 5am (depending on exactly when your premium starts).

Not just 2 over all, as most common jobs give regular raises, id still like to keep track of all of those. It also lacks the ability to select multiple shifts to update their job titles (which you put in the wrong place from being exhausted and working 3 jobs, this feature could be turned on and off for those of us who would use it or for those who are upgrading to the pro version to add multiple jobs on 1 instead of using multiple apps). If those things were adjusted and they add an actual color choice of not just light and dark themes but light green, dark green, light purple, dark pink, light orange, dark blue etc.. 2 shades of 7 or 8 colors, you know actual COLORS, for the different job selection (as in each specific job is a different color if you choose, or craft job dark red, grocery job light green, college job dark blue. Default color can match the theme) as well as over all theme. I'd give it 5 stars and suggest it to people I work with who also try to try and work multiple jobs or do contract work.

You can sort the shifts (ie chronologically) by tapping on the column title, such as the ""Date"" label. Tapping on it again will reverse the sorting order.
Feel free to email me at ARforAndroid@gmail.com with the details of how it is adding hours and I'll be happy to help.

Some do not have their expenses covered so they want the expenses subtracted from their wages to see what they're really making. You can check the ""Add Expenses"" in the Tacking section of the Job Settings in order to have your expenses added instead.

One possible way to do that is to use the Tips, Sales or Expenses feature. When you're paid an extra amount you can add that amount to a shift, or add a 0 hour shift and add an amount there. All of those features have extra options and are found in the Tracking section of the Job Settings.

Be sure to keep both Work Log Free and Work Log Pro installed. Work Log Free contains all of your records and does all the work, Work Log Pro is a tiny app that lets Free know that you've upgraded which unlocks all the extras. Uninstalling Work Log Free will delete all of your records.

I like the simplicity and ease of use of the product. It has export and back up options which make it simple to maintain and protect your records. I would suggest a couple of tweaks. First, you can export time recorded as a CSV and you can set the default mail address, so that an e-mail is prepared and ready to send with a couple of presses. The app does not autofill the db backup mail in the same way, as you manually have to enter the send address. It would be useful if the default mail address were auto-entered here too. Second, the scroll wheels used to enter the date and time of shifts is slower than simply typing in the times. Could we have that as an option? Otherwise it's a great app!

Different spreadsheet readers sometimes format the data differently so I may need to account for the one you're using in an update. If you can email me an example of the issue and let me know what spreadsheet reader you're using at ARforAndroid@gmail.com I can look into that.

The easiest way to transfer or backup your data is to email it to yourself from the General Settings with the ""Backup Database"" button. Then you can open that email attachment on any device with Work Log installed to import those shifts. Email ARforAndroid@gmail.com for support.

You can email a spreadsheet by exporting from the ""View Shifts"" screen. This will be a .csv file which can be read by most spreadsheet readers such as Excel and Google Sheets. The records that you are viewing at the time (ie the month or pay period you are viewing) are the ones that will be exported.

In order to get breaks on your export, make sure ""Show Breaks"" is enabled in the Tracking section, and the Spreadsheet Settings section of the Job Settings. I see how a quick ""Edit"" shortcut could be useful, I'll look into adding that in a future update.

I can't even figure out a way to manipulate for a quick temporary fix until additional option is added... HELP! Thank you!   -&gt; Note, most of all issues from previous review below have been updated, Thank You, Andrew!   Very easy, simple to use, I thought this was everything I needed, loved it... Unfortunately I was really disappointed when I paid to ""Upgrade""... Exporting into Excel shows exactly what I see on my phone app... But I was expecting more functionality from it - ie The shift start and end times in separate columns, with total hours and minutes formatted as such... With formulas. I was hoping to expand on the imported data - Being able to import weekly, to cut and paste adding into a continuous spreadsheet... Being able to see pay due, add column of amount paid, and column calculating balance due (or overpaid)... Also wanting to add columns for expenses to calculate totals for tax purposes... Within the app itself it would be so helpful to be able to add multiple daily expenses that I can label/note as Travel Time, Gas, Food, etc... Again, all for assisting with putting all numbers together for filing taxes... It is that time of the year and I'm dying to find SOMETHING to help, to simplify as much as possible! I'd give a much higher rating if y'all could expand on what is available now, would even pay a little more for THAT upgrade!  The $2.99 I spent was money lost :(",3,0,4.0,2018-01-07 07:38:14,,

You can sort the order of the shifts by tapping on the column headers. For example, tapping on the ""Date"" header will sort the shifts by date, tapping on it again will reverse the order.

Better export support.  I have to print out my hours and turn it in for each pay period. It really needs to auto fill the file name to reflect the pay period. (Hours_09-05-17_to_09_18_15.csv or Hours_Pay_Period_27.csv, etc..) Right now you have to hit Export > Settings > Spreadsheet File Name > Enter the new file name > OK > Back > Export > Continue ... Otherwise you will overwrite your last export every time.  2. Print and/or PDF support. It's cumbersome to get my hours printed out or sent to my employer in a printable format. Should have option to print from app, or at least support saving in a PDF format for easier distribution.  3. Settings export. I just upgraded my phone. It's awesome that you can export your data and restore it, but it would be nice to have a setting export as well.  4. Better looking widgets. I think the app interface is just fine and don't really care how it looks because it is perfectly functional. The widgets should look a little nicer as they stick out like a sore thumb and don't blend with any theme. At minimum a dark theme option, but rounded corners, color picker for background and text would be great.",4,0,4.0,2017-12-01 04:24:01,,

You can export your shifts as a spreadsheet from the View Shifts screen with the export button. The shifts your are viewing are the ones that will be exported, such as that week or pay period. You can even enter a default email to email to in the spreadsheet settings.

That bug might be related to how the spreadsheet reader you're using is viewing the date. You can try changing the date format (in the General Settings) to see if that helps. Letting me know which spreadsheet reader and date format at ARforAndroid@gmail.com can help me fix that in an update.

(My holiday pay works out the same amount as my wage) so it would be nice if you select it as holiday it put £0 in wages and £60 in holiday pay for example.

However there is one major flaw that I've found. As a shift worker, shifts at different times and days will have different rates of pay. But from what I've found you can only have one 'holiday multiplier' for your job. But for me, I get one rate on Monday to Friday, one on Saturday, one on Sunday's, and one on public holidays.  From what I can understand, from an app development point of view this should be an easy fix. All that I request is that the developer add in different wage multipliers for different days.

For holiday pay to be listed be sure to have a holiday multiplier and wage set. Then when saving a shift you can mark that shift as a holiday to apply the holiday multiplier.

If there was a way to shut off the scrolling and just use the arrows to move from pay period to pay period that would be great.,5,0,3.0,2017-07-08 01:22:54,,

Google Drive tends to remove the file extension which makes importing from Drive tricky. The easiest way to backup/transfer is to email the backup to yourself. You can email me at ARforAndroid@gmail.com and I'll be happy to help you import that Drive backup.

There is no cloud backup. It's possible to recover shifts by importing a backup. The easiest way to backup/transfer your shifts is to email them to yourself using the ""Backup Database"" option in the General Settings. You can then import those shifts directly from that email.

The Work Log Key is a tiny file that simply lets Work Log Free know that you've upgraded which unlocks all of the premium features. Uninstalling Work Log Key will cause Work Log Free to show adds and not allow exporting. Both Free and Key are required.

There are two things however that would help me greatly if you could explain to me how to do them:  1st - What I would like to be able to do is rename and/or delete jobs as the positions change.  2nd - It would be nice if I could have multiple positions for a single job so I would be able to see what my total hours and pay should be for a specific pay period. Right now I have to go to the three jobs and total them manually for each pay period.,4,24,3.0,2016-10-27 07:51:22,"Thanks for using Work Log and for upgrading!
You can delete or rename jobs by long clicking (tap and hold) on the job title in the list of jobs in the settings.
I plan on adding the ability to see your job totals combined and group jobs together in one of the many future updates I have planned for Work Log.

Any suggestions or a way you could add something customizable?",5,0,2.0,2016-07-14 17:31:45,"Hi Brett,
Thanks for using Work Log, for the kind words, and for upgrading!
Currently I can't think of any way you can account for both drive time and holiday pay, but I see how a feature like that could be useful for people in your situation. I'm going to look into ways I can make that possible in an update.

Thanks again!

Renaming a job should never cause any issues or affect the shifts. Uninstalling Work Log or deleting the App Data from the Android settings is the only way to clear the shifts. If you have a backup of your data it's possible to restore it.

Installing Work Log Pro does not affect your data as it is only a key that lets Work Log Free know you've upgraded. Uninstalling Work Log or deleting the App Data from the Android settings is the only way to clear the data.

If you backup your files you'll be able to restore them on a new device, without that backup your data cannot be restored. The easiest way to backup is to email the backup to yourself from the ""General Settings"" then restore them from the email.

You can add employees as jobs in the settings selection screen. You can also rename the job as an employee name on that screen.

Without a backup there is no way to restore your shifts.
You can backup your data by emailing it to yourself from the general settings using the ""Backup Database"" feature. Then you can open the email and open the attachment to restore that backup.

Thanks for using Work Log, for the kind words, and for upgrading!
There is no way to automate Work Log to calculate Sundays as time and a half, but you can use the holiday or overtime feature to mark Sundays to be calculated at time and a half manually. I plan on adding an automatic feature in a future update.

Thanks again!

The easiest way to bring shifts from an old device to a new one is to email yourself the backup from the old device using the ""Backup Database"" option. Next open that email on your new device when Work Log is installed.

The overtime options in Work Log might be able to calculate your hours correctly. You can add a second job from the settings as well. Each job will have it own set of pay rates, overtime rules etc.

This is a common point confusion due to the way I present the overtime pay.  The ""Overtime Extra"" row shows how much extra you make per hour, in your example you get an extra $8/h. I think you'll find the your pay all adds up correctly.

Thanks for using Work Log and for the feedback!
One way you could adjust your pay rate on specific days is to use the Overtime function in Shift mode. Enter your Sunday pay rate as your overtime rate, then on Sundays log your hours as overtime.

I hope that helps make things a little easier.

To email your shifts as a spreadsheet go to the tab you want (ie the week you want to export) and tap ""Export"" in the top right. You can delete a job by long tapping on it from the settings screen, unfortunately you can't delete your primary job.

I find the easiest way to transfer your shifts from one device to another is to email them to yourself from your old device, open the email on the new device and tap on the attachment. Beam can be tricky, email me at ARforAndroid@gmail.com for any more questions or support with that.

Work Log will export the list of shifts you're currently viewing. To export your shifts as a spreadsheet go to the tab (ie. Year) then go to the year or week or pay period etc. that you want to export then tap the export button. If you continue to have problems feel free to email me at ARforAndroid@gmail.com.

Thanks for using Work Log!
If you go to job settings you can ""Export all as Spreadsheet"" which exports your shifts as a standardized spreadsheet that can be read by any document reader like Microsoft Word, Google Drive and Simple Spreadsheet on Android. You can also export the group of shifts you are viewing from the ""View Shifts"" section",2014-05-08 20:14:15

Thanks for using Work Log!
When you ""Backup Database"" Work Log creates a ""worklog.db"" file in a folder labelled ""Work Log"" on your local storage, even if you don't complete the export process (a necessity with Android). You can access this file directly from your local storage and do whatever you like with it. 
Hope this helps!
