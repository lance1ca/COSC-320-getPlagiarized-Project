Great time killer. It's easy to pick up and the different landscapes add interest. A few features I'd love to see in a 'Pocket City 2' - Relative sizing for buildings (currently the stadium is as big as the arcade). - Underground rail rather than sky rail - Upgrades for all buildings and further upgrades for zones to create bigger skyscrapers etc. - Bigger variety of special buildings. Not having these things now though not enough to stop me giving 5 stars.,5,22,1.1.355,2020-08-02 09:04:09,,

You'll be making money more quickly than you can possibly spend, and it will fill up to your cash limit in a matter of seconds. You can raise this limit by building and upgrading banks later on, but you'll still never be strapped for cash. During my entire playthrough (all the way up to level 80 something) I never once struggled with anything.   I always had a surplus of money and it was always easy to keep the citizens happy.

Admittedly, it's not as pretty as its overcommercialised cousin, but it compensates for that tenfold by not frustrating progress with inhibitors like City Storage and manual, wait-based production. The dynamics of this game are thus very different. For example, you can unlock all of the land expansion in a single day by temporarily cranking taxes up sky high and buying a new plot every time your bank accrues enough cash, which happens in real time.

My only gripes are with the expert/hardest difficulty and how you need to actively fight the leveling system to survive. Leveling up increases your costs and decreases your citizens' happiness, reducing your tax revenues. Trying to increase revenue by building more doesn't work because food import costs will bleed you dry until you unlock farms at level 15. Thus you have to avoid any leveling for as long as possible, which is somewhat counterintuitive. But! This only matters if you are a hardcore min-maxer.

You don't then have to pay even more to progress through the game, the price tag you see is the price you pay, no more. It's a fairly in-depth city builder game that you can play through without worrying about being pushed to pay extra, and you don't have to worry about ridiculous wait times either, you can progress exponentially with each time you play, not having to wait 24hrs+ for a single upgrade.

Structurally, it takes the best idea from the old Facebook Sim City (purchasable land expansions) and marries it to a beguiling graphical style that still makes sense at multiple zooms. Lots of options for balancing the graphics and gameplay with battery consumption, but even on the default 'medium' settings, it takes very little from my old Huaweii, even after 20-30 minutes.

From what I can see, 1 Obelisk is as good as 10 of them. Also the citizen attractions Landmarks seem to have different effects depending on the building. A Lattice Tower is going to have a higher citizen attraction multiplier than a City Tower, however is not clear from the description.

big city, it crashed and the game file was completely gone. It made me 
start again, despite having been autosaved probably a hundred times, and 
after restarting with no problems after many other crashes. Then last night 
it crashed my whole phone, freezing in the game screen and sending a
