Did 3 easy levels and skipped to very hard. Did about 10 of those and refunded. Waaaay too easy,1,0,,2021-02-08 12:06:49,,

I completed the whole game in less than 2 hours :(. EDIT: as stated below, they have made new levels, but they are also way too easy (I don't play chess btw). I completed level 100 in about 5 seconds with 3 moves where you have 5 moves to make. Lvl 98 was pretty challenging though.",3,3,1.6,2021-02-07 06:42:38,Hello! Check out the recent update for more difficult levels! Thanks for your review,2021-02-01 23:16:55

Also maybe later in the future make it so we can choose the theme of the board instead of it changing every few levels because not gonna lie there are some themes which I really don't like,4,5,1.6,2021-02-04 08:20:32,,

I must, however, remove a star for the fact that every move generates a full throttle haptic feedback buzz and there's no option to turn it off. A supremely annoying oversight for an otherwise well realized game to be burdened with.",4,13,1.6,2021-01-25 04:38:09,,

What is really annoying is that although sound can be turned off, the haptic feedback cannot.",4,7,,2020-12-20 01:30:17,,

First, speed up the menus. It takes far too long to get into the game for me to want to even open the app. Second, the next level button at the end of each level should really take you to the next level and not to level select. Maybe add a second option for level select? Lastly, add a setting to turn of the vibrate functionality. Also, label menu buttons maybe? Cool idea though!",3,28,1.2,2020-12-19 01:35:47,,

First is that I personally don't like the sound the pieces make, but I like the background music. There isn't a way to only turn off one or the other though. Secondly, the time between levels is a bit too long. The animation for the tick and the arrow is drawn out and takes you to a menu rather than the next level. Speeding up the animation and putting you into the next level would improve this in my opinion. Otherwise it's great!",4,10,1.2,2020-12-09 03:56:56,,
