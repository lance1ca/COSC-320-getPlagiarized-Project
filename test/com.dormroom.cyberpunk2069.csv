Unlike PUBG, Cyberpunk 2069 is much more friendly for short play sessions, and as such it's got friendly, easy to use controls. The graphics are realistic even on medium. This game does utilize a leveling up system and you do need it to unlock more and more loadout slots etc as you move on. It's Definitely worth a try.",5,21,1,2019-12-25 23:23:02,,
