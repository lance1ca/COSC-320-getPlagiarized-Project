Since there isn't anyway to tell, many times, the tones will be playing during the TTS, so you have to do a lot of trial and error via replaying the same alert you created over and over again until you get the timing right. Also, another issue I have is that you can't save any custom alerts to your mobile device as video files, so you can't share them with friends and such or upload them to the Internet and there's a huge custom mock EAS fanbase on YouTube. I hope the developer can hopefully fix these issues and make the app more streamlined and easier to use. Also as a suggestion to the developer, you should look up Alert Ready, which is the Canadian EAS and possibly include their alert tones in this app too as it'd also appeal to a wider audience and if you also were to remedy the previous two issues I mentioned earlier, we'd also start to see a lot of custom mock Alert Ready warnings as well.",3,6,1.4.1,2018-11-10 18:55:39,"I know this is an old review but have a look at the new version (2.1) of the app, which is rolling out this week: after the app updates, you should (finally!) be able to export your EAS alerts to video!

If you are ok using your device all the time then its fine. there is no export feature and apparently there never will be.  I contacted the developer and was given an explanation that is simply not logical. I have been in IT, specifically IT Security, Now known as Cyber Security for 25 years.. I have worked as a developer and with development teams, engineering teams and project teams.   What irritates me is when I asked why there was no export feature I was told things like it would require a rooted device and it was complicated. Odd that over applications have an save and export feature that works out of the box. Yes you can use a screen capture application to save what you create however this is resource intensive and the frame rates are horrible. I have an Nvidia Shield K1 for example,  It struggles with capturing anything with this application yet can capture 30FPS on most games using the built in feature on the device.  If you can save the file as a package I am confused why you can't save the file and export it to somethings like ffmpeg. And also yes many of my devices are rooted for testing purposes.",2,0,1.4.1,2016-12-17 15:57:45,,

It's worth the $2.00,4,2,1.3.9,2014-01-07 18:21:26,"Hey, thanks for the feedback.
There are many TTS engines - with different voices - in the Google Play store, including free ones. You can install them on your phone/tablet and use them with EAS Simulator. Check out ""Ivona TTS"", for example.",2014-01-12 12:37:22

I couldn't because I had to do alot of stuff which took along time. I found this and this is really simple! The preview isn't even laggy! And it has superb quality. I love this and how its working on my 4.4.1 KitKat ROM!:) Would give it 10 stars. Are you going to add a male voice? That would be awesome!,5,2,1.3.9,2014-01-03 14:42:55,"Hi Saul. I'm glad to know you're enjoying the app!
About the voices: EAS Simulator doesn't control the voice. Instead, it uses whatever voices you have installed and configured in your device's Text to Speech (TTS) Engine. So, the voices you hear during the alerts depend on the TTS engine and voices you have installed in your phone/tablet. Cheers!",2013-12-25 12:54:14

Another suggestion would be to add the male voice to the app which would make it really realistic ! Thanks for this amazing app!!!,5,2,1.3.8,2013-11-16 16:18:48,,

Some bugs have been fixed in the meantime.
There's a ""Help"" menu in the alert creator (menu key - Help) which has some relevant info. Now there is also a video tutorial on YouTube: http://youtu.be/y5bg9zGd9Gw",2013-10-25 00:38:16
