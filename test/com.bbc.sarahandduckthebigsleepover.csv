The planet's playing music there is no sound. Shame because rest of game is good.",1,15,,2020-09-19 05:45:43,,

Needs more to do. For toddlers only. Great for people ages 2 to 4 years of age. Any older and it will not hold children's interest from the lack of content and lack of brain stimulating activities. Aside that, it's great. Looks good too. Love the art style. Worth it's price.",4,32,1.3,2020-04-14 02:02:56,,

Contacted the developer twice with NO response whatsoever in a 2 week period. Very poor service. Won't be purchasing from this developer again. They take your money for a game that doesn't work and don't even respond when you request assistance. Disgusting,1,35,1.2,2017-08-11 23:25:22,,

App developers: Explain why you want permissions or don't ask for them.  I'd give it 5 stars otherwise.,3,38,1.2,2017-04-24 14:50:17,,
