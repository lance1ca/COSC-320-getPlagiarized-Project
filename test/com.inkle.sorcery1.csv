It's likely an issue with the Play Store itself rather than the app. I suggest you try uninstalling the app, then selecting ""install"" again in Play Store to see if that unsticks it. You won't be charged twice.

If it still isn't downloading, please email us with more details and we'll see if we can figure it out!",2014-03-13 09:21:14

Personally i think its worth the price.  Reason for 4 stars?
