It all feels very polished and smooth; I have yet to encounter a bug or problem with the game running/crashing.

The function to repeat a location over again is a good idea, dying to a mob or wanting to change how to react to different situations was a frequent occurrence for me and made easy with the game mechanics.

Personally i think its worth the price.  Reason for 4 stars?
