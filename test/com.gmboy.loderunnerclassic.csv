The graphics are nice (though a higher resolution option might be fun to look at, as well as classic Apple II green screen), and you can't beat those puzzles.  Unfortunately, as anyone who played this on the Apple II (which had a standard analog joystick) will tell you, it's best played with digital controls (most people just used the keyboard back in the day).  However, they added Moga support but no HID gamepad support or keyboard support.  Worse, I own the Moga Hero Power and it actually maps the game to the analog stick only.  Playing a game as fast as lode runner, requiring precise digital controls, just doesn't work well with the Moga analog stick or, I suspect, any analog stick.  It's a shame they didn't make it work with standard bluetooth/HID controllers, most of which have gamepads, or keyboard presses (which can be mapped to many keyboards and android game controllers).  Please update this to include HID support and mappable keyboard controls so everyone can have fun with the precise control the game requires.",3,4,1.6.1,2015-02-08 12:00:25,,

It appears that the conversion was done by Studio Voltz, and all I can say is that someone blew it, big time. Specifically, the controls for this game are well-nigh unusable.  A simple relocatable screen-overlaid joystick (as in, e.g., Terraria) would have made this game a joy. As it is, there are three control options, all terrible.  Let's examine them one by one!  First, there's the D-Pad.  This shrinks the size of the game screen to approximately half of its original size (by square area), in order to make room for gigantic d-pad buttons. I can barely see the game screen. Next.  Second, there's the on-screen controls. Rather than using a flexible relative-to-click-position joystick, this game simply maps screen areas to joystick positions. This means that if you want to move up, you must place your finger at the top of the screen, completely obscuring the screens. Might work for people with extremely narrow fingers. Next.  Third, there's the tip-screen. Urrg. No thanks.  Frankly, I think it reflects quite poorly on Studio Voltz that they let this one out the door.",1,0,,2014-07-06 15:36:26,,
