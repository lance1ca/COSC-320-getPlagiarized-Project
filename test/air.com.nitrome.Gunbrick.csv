The controls in this really surprised me, really fun to control. The sound quality is a little fuzzy, but not annoying. Puzzle adventure games are my favorite genre ever, and this doesn't disappoint. Now the price is a bit high, but with more levels added I think it will eventually be worth the full price. But since I support nitrome I have no problem paying it.
