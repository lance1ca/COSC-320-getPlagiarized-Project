You will will probably prefer the second control scheme. Just go into the settings to change it. Also, if you have a bluetooth controller such as an Xbox joypad, it works great with that too, and also with both styles of settings. Best of luck and kind regards Zephiroth Games",2020-01-21 15:18:16

I must admit I wasn't enjoying it as much at first, using the on-screen controls the ship rotation isn't accurate enough. But after pairing a Bluetooth game pad it's brilliant (use the second control option). Yes, the gameplay is slightly faster than the original, but that just makes it more frenetic and challenging!! Just two requests:- 1) option to turn off the on-screen controls for gamepad users. 2) where's the hyperspace feature?",5,6,1.59,2019-11-28 16:32:11,,

Authentic play and sound effects, but with a virtual joystick mode for those of us that could never quite master the left / right / thrust button combo (though there's button mode too if you want true authenticity). The only thing missing is hyperspace, and given the rez that isn't needed. Both saucer sizes are here tho, & if it had the 'pa-POW' sound of the original large saucer this would actually be the perfect game.",5,5,1.59,2019-08-20 00:40:44,"Hi and thanks for reviewing the game.
