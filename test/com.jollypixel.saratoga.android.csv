Although gameplay was great, some maps were too tiny and ended too fast. Also, there were no cavalry units which I had expected.

Or maybe a game with more sea battles and different types of ships?",4,9,1.04,2018-08-21 11:01:36,Thanks for the review. Saratoga does have more smaller scale skirmish battles than the other games.

I would live to see one of these games set in ww2 someday, perhaps in the pacific theater. The Vietnam War, or even more modern wars would be fantastic as well. The gameplay mechanics are incredibly solid, there's nowhere Pixel Soldiers can't go.",5,0,1.01,2017-07-02 18:29:03,"Thanks again. :) I do plan to explore more areas of history, including WW2 and modern warfare.",2017-07-05 10:37:24

Love this title as well as your others. I think this era is best for pixel soldiers!

Historians seem split on when the stars and stripes was first used in battle. I used the flag that is most popularly thought of as the Revolutionary War flag for simplicity. Interesting question though. Thanks for the review, Austin. :)",2017-06-25 16:24:13
