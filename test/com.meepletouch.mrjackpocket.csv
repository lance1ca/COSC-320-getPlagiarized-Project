We need more of such boardgames on Android.  Would be better if the statistics and rankings used the Google Play Games service. :),4,0,1.0.3,2013-10-07 05:12:47,Unfortunately the Google Play Game service does not suit this specific game needs (2 leaderboards and be able to store score and level achieved). I agree using the google play service will be better once theee needs can be fulfilled.,2013-10-07 10:56:23

But...it downloaded in French. Is there a way to get the English version? Or can the language be selected within the game? Turns out there is. Thanks for the assist,5,2,1.0.2,2013-10-03 15:22:12,You can simply switch languages by using the small flags at the bottom of the screen Menu.

The AI also seems reasonably decent so far, and I like the fact that it keeps track of various stats about wins/losses.  I wish other android board games had this level of polish.",5,6,1.0.1,2013-09-30 13:33:40,,
