The art works is great and the music is soothing. They have improvement their interface from the previous games to. It took twice as long to complete as compared to the first installment and the puzzles were a little bit harder.,5,2,1.03,2020-11-28 08:04:19,,

I expected more after such a long wait, but gave it 4 stars because it still beats a lot of the market. I like that the hints in this one try to isolate a specific problem you're trying to fix, however, there's no indication of which order you should be going in so you may get a hint for a puzzle you're not ready for yet. Also, I found the inventory to be in the way a lot and numerous grammatical errors. Completed in 2.5-3hrs with medium help.",4,14,1.03,2020-05-13 00:02:32,,

It's very challenging and unique. It's not the usual hint system which is both good and bad. I personally don't like this version- I had to look at walkthroughs several times to figure out what I'm supposed to do. There's zero cut scenes and very little story, which is something I personally love so that was disappointing but some people prefer that. Overall worth the sale price of $1.",4,1,1.03,2020-05-10 00:35:07,,
