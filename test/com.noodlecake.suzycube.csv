Smooth difficulty curve, well designed environments, cute characters, and great music are just a few of the things that make this a worthwhile purchase.   If you liked collectable based games, like Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64, there's a good chance you'll like this. The stars hidden throughout the level give reason to replay levels and explore further. Even on replay, the levels seldom feel repetitive.  The controls could be better and there are times when you may be fighting the camera angle and invisible joystick to get Suzy to move or jump where you want. Not having a visible joystick on the screen makes the UI less distracting, but it can make it difficult to define the limits of the control you have over Suzy. For me, I would find my left thumb sliding over the middle and right side of the screen.  There could be more consistency in the use of directional shadows. When the directional 'high noon' shadows are in effect, knowing what Suzy is over is a lot easier. When there are no shadows, it can be difficult to discern her position, particularly over enemies, etc.  Even so, I readily endorse this game.",5,10,1.0.12,2019-08-10 20:30:22,,

There's also hat power ups but you need to finish the level to keep them or get more. The flaws come in the controls, they don't work quite as well with the challenges. A lot of levels have platforming challenges or are timed in one way or another and when trying to jump from one place to the next it's hard to keep momentum and you'll stop short mid air.

The only two things that need fixing is the floaty controls for touch screen and the lack of cloud saving (I'm playing this on a galaxy s7, galaxy tab s2 and nexus player). As for controllers I've used the Asus nexus player controller, Ps4 controller and a corded Xbox 360 with no issues.
