One of the better looking FPV simulators in general and I think the best looking on Android.  I hesitated at first from buying the pc version, but after trying it out on my phone I was quick to snap it up for android.  May even buy the pc version when money is freed up.  The biggest thing that pushed me to buy it was I am able to hook my ps3 controllers, with the help of an OTG converter, to both my Galaxy S3 and Note Edge.  I do have to walk through the calibration to get both sticks setup properly, but after that it is happy flying!  The visually simple levels work great on both devices even at higher quality settings.  Only my Note Edge can handle the tree filled levels.  The S3 just doesn't have the power for those levels even at the lower settings.  I am also happy to say it works great on the Nvidia shield.  The built in sticks are a little stiffer so it is probably quite different than flying with an actual RC Controller.  But as it and the Ps3 Controller sticks are spring centered, I wasn't expecting the experience to be similar; just happy to have some more similar hardware to practice with.

I just think you need to add a few different quads to choose from ... and maybe add a multi player to race each other .... but I understand it's a Sim ... but also needs different adjustable wind , day/night flying and more objects than the stick things ... but nice work and can't wait to see what u add over the next few updates",5,4,1.1,2015-05-16 00:33:40,,

Flying your quadcopter around each map is very exciting and cool. I can't wait to see what else is done to the sim. This is my new favorite application.

Works great with both a PS3 controller and (surprisingly) my Taranis, runs exactly the same as the desktop version. Throttle needs more punch in high-rate mode (seems to be less than there was in earlier versions), and some more (adjustable) throw for rolls and flips would be good, but perfectly workable as-is.",5,0,1.0,2015-05-08 20:32:37,,
