The layout editor is really finicky but it's outdated so I expected that. It allows me to add buttons on my screen that emulate mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts/keys flawlessly and without root. Emulating touches requires root but I don't have that. I was able to play OSU Taiko by adding four buttons on screen and then remapping the outputs to the keys I set in the game and it works great!
