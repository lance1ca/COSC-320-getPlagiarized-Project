It's a good app and worth getting if you're studying for the NREMT-B written test as it helps establish a basic foundation in the knowledge base you'll need to pass. That being said, I would not recommend that you use this app alone as I found the questions on the test to be harder than the ones this app presents. However, the obstetrics material in the app is very good (it can be difficult to find good OB study material but this app has it). I recommend you get this app (paid version) and use it with studying, it's a great supplemental study resource and as that, has my compliments.",4,9,1.1,2018-02-10 01:05:51,,
