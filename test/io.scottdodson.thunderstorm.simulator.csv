Just the sound effects. Update: After giving it permission to access the camera it worked. I left it on default for 30 minutes and it drained my battery overnight though. Timer was set for 30 minutes - I fell asleep - so not sure what that is about. Will continue testing.,3,7,2.0.0,2019-07-23 07:43:28,"Hi Mike, please make sure the app has permission to access your camera: Settings - Apps - Thunderstorm Simulator - Permissions - Toggle on Camera.

it. There are much better free apps out there, that sound better, and do so

it's not worth it.",1,6,2.0.0,2018-05-28 04:58:37,"Sorry to hear you don't enjoy the app. Thunderstorm Simulator provides a premium experience with no ads. Please see Settings for more options.
