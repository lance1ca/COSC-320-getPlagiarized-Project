I've read countless reviews about the ""aquaribase"" lacking, and I have found a few missing species especially the plants sections, but overall its a nice app and the more people that buy it the better it will get. I will recommend this to all my fellow hobbyists and hope that the developers don't abandon the freshwater aquaribase any time soon.",5,0,4.0,2013-12-19 07:13:51,Thanks Jason for you review.
