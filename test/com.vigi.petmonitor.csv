This fact made me so incredibly mad, when I discovered it, AFTER bying the @#$%&! app. I thought that I had FINALLY found an app where my pooch could both hear AND see me talking to her, to calm her down, while I was away. We had tried the audio only apps, but they had just confused the living daylights out of her. Turns out, with this app, your pooch can't see you either. You can just change camera veiw ü§¶üèºUninstall and I want my money back! What a scam.",1,3,1.7.11,2020-08-10 09:22:51,,
