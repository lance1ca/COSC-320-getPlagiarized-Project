The new translations in some cases either obscure the intent of the text (Ayla's jumbled text about dying, then having a baby, then making Kino chief, apparently in that order), or they reframe beloved characters in an uncomfortable light (such as Frog now being sexist because of poorly constructed dialogue, particularly the first time he interacts with Flea.) The controls are also loose and awkward, which can make several of the challenges where precision control is a factor virtually unplayable. This could be solved with added controller functionality, such as MOGA compatibility, but there do not currently appear to be any such options available. Visually the game is an improvement, with the classic graphics retained but polished, and the anime cutscenes from the Playstation and later ports included. I'd love to call this a unanimous improvement, but unfortunately the significance of the issues in the translations and controls make this just okay. I wouldn't consider it a step up over an SNES ROM on a decent emulator or any of the other portable ports of the game.

non-sensical. It is often almost impossible to actually select the correct 
enemy. This would be annoying in any game but since the battles are in real 
time, you don't actually have time to try and select the correct thing, and 
thus all strategy of what to hit goes out the window. Because of the mode 
which allows you to pause battle when selecting techs, it isn't such a 
problem, but it is still difficult with normal attacks. The other issue I 
had was with the coloured button system used for minigames. It isually 
works well but with minigames where speed is imperative (specifically the 
copying minigame) you often spend too much time looking for where on the 
screen the correct button is, and thus lose completely. Credit where it's

the prehistoric hunting grounds where you chase Nu around were the most 
difficult to traverse, but not too bad. I used a guide on Wiki to play 
through, I recommend it, helped me a lot. I had no problems whatsoever with

I loved this game on snes and of course got it immediately when i saw it for android.  I have a galaxy s5, runs perfect.  Id suggest letting it auto-pause when locking the phone in case you need to break away.  It restarts game if you do that.  It also doesnt tell my phone autoshutoff to stop, itll, dim and goto sleep, resetting it, if u dont tap the screen every so often during a scene.  The attack targeting menu needs a lil work.  I love secret of mana's style.  Anyway, great game, well worth 10 bucks.  Edit:   The game battle menu has been improved... but I recently played the game and it required me to download ""Google Play Games"".

You can now save anywhere and can play even offline without worrying about getting stopped by online only DRM or losing your progress.  Its well connected to Google Play Games as it should have been in the beginning and has added achievements which are welcomed.  I would say care was finally taken care of for the mobile version.

There are several bugs in the current version (the new release of Feb 2018). External gamepad support is incomplete/bugged so that some things are impossible to do with gamepad. eg: leading the lost cat back to the girl at the fair. It only follows when talked to by touch or mouseclick, but runs away if talked to by gamepad 'A' button. Another bug relates to text entry of character names, which does not display the default names in the text entry fields (entire entry field is just grey). Each default name is displayed only AFTER it has been chosen through the 'Accept' button. Possibly that bug is due to invalid dependency on some specific GPU (needs to be generic). Also, the game completely ignores name entry from external keyboard (USB). And these are just the bugs I noticed after a few minutes of gameplay. I'll report further bugs as I proceed into the game... An additional bug is that the easternmost section of Guardia Forest 1000AD is rendered as a 4:3 segment of the full 16:9 screen, with wide vertical black borders on both sides of the rendered segment.",4,2,2.0.1,2018-03-01 02:38:18,,

It moves too smooth and over shoots evertime past the trees and doesn't allow for proper frame adjustments. I have beaten this game 30 plus times and in this port during this one task I spent over 3 hours trying to get up the mountain. If not corrected this was a waste of money.

The only real issue I have is that the climb death peak starting section is pretty obnoxious using a phone but is quite doable. The people on here saying it's unplayable are either experiencing an issue I've not encountered once on 4 separate playthroughs or they are lying. As for the ones complaining about save points, I can only imagine that they weren't around when all games were like that. You can save from the world map at any time and there are multiple save points in each area you travel through. It's an older game, and that's how games were at the time. If walking back to a save point that is maybe 2 minutes away is too hard, then this is probably not the game for you. If you're wanting to replay this game as it was (with minor updates like touch screen) then this is the one for you. The emulators I tried before I found this on the store all caused hassles but it's been smooth sailing since I found this app. Thanks to everyone to helped make this app and please get Chrono Cross on here next so I can die happy Edit: The dlc ""issue"" yes you will have to download more of the game. My experience was 3 downloads across a 40+ hour runthrough. Not exactly the nightmare some of the whiners on here are making it out to be but indeed an issue if you lack access to WiFi at the couple times it wants to do it. Never had to download anything else after. It's a shame to see some of the complaints on here considering how trouble free the excessive amount of time I've spent playing the app has been. I'm normally pretty rough on judging games but I saw no major issues as long as you're patient with dlc (2-3 minutes of downloading at max and only a couple times total) and don't go into a frothing convulsive rage the second you don't get your way like some of the reviewers. My favorite review is the guy who claims there's no save option and after 20 minutes he rage quit.

I recommend playing on a tablet. Over all it's a great game but they could have made the controls in battle mode better. With our technology they should be using the PlayStation version of this game cause of the nice cut scenes that enhance the story.

Second auto saves don't work or arn't included plus game often crashed/closes when switching to another app or turning the screen for even a second (hangouts is causing me to lose lots of progress)",4,2,1.0.6,2016-04-03 20:40:49,,

The onscreen joystick is wonderful, a little weird to work with at first, but very happy that they did not incorporate a D-Pad or ABXY buttons since it would take up valuable screen space. My only wish is that when you are in a battle, it would be very helpful if you could move the stat screen from the bottom to the top, and vice versa as you can in the SNES version of this game.

Requires downloads at certain portions of the story for DRM reasons. The only reason I bought this was to play something when i had no service. Controls in battle are imprecise resulting fatal gamplay mistakes. Also this app will probably be unplayable  with the next android update for months as it was with lollipop and kitkat before it. 3 stars for being the classic chrono trigger. 0 stars as an android app.,3,32,1.0.4,2015-05-16 09:23:54,,

Thank you developers for bringing this awesome game to android, and for doing such a good job!   Chrono trigger deserves a perfect score, regardless of platform.  Gracias!!!!",5,0,1.0.3,2015-01-05 16:16:20,,

It's a great game. But if you're trying it for the first time, don't buy this. Buy the DS version, or hell, even the SNES version if you can find it. The game is there, but there are several glaring problems.   What is up with the intermittent content downloads? They happen every few areas at completely bizzare locations. This was a SNES game originally; where did the file size bloat come from?  The controls are sometimes thought-out, but are just tacked on in other locations. Why am I able to tap on menu items directly, but to select an enemy I need to slide my finger on the virtual control stick?  Finally, and this is the part that I was most disappointed about, but the soundtrack was botched for no good reason. Instead of full tracks looping in the background, they cut off early and fade out, only to restart again from the beginning. As a game that was praised originally for its soundtrack, this is terrible. There's still hope, Square. You just have to fix this up.",1,7,1.0.2,2013-12-20 13:04:15,,

This is my #1 game of all time. I love that the menus and battle screens are optimized for the phone, and the swiping and navigation is brilliant in those respects.  However, two major problems knock 2 stars right off the top.  1. If the screen locks the game will crash and spit you back to the start screen...regardless if you've saved recently. My interim solution is to plug it into a power source and set ""do not sleep when plugged in"", that way I can walk away for a minute to hit the bathroom or what not without losing all my progress....but this needs a fix fast!  2. The phantom directional is great and all, but is barely equal to most emulator buttons. It is very difficult to slot your character into those hard to enter buildings...entering guardia forest alone could take you 10 seconds of tinkering with how Crono is moving....not cool.  Like I said, this is my #1 game of all time, and this port is decent.

I won't bother reviewing the game.  This port, however, I have a few things to say about.  First: Clunky Interface - I get that we're trying to emulate a SNES pad on a touch screen, but the virtual joy pad doesn't respond well.  If it were fixed in place, one might have a better chance of controlling how the character moves, but it appears wherever you put your left thumb, meaning you can't just tap in a direction, making movement awkward.  Second: No save state. This isn't an SNES we're playing on.  These are portable devices.  We aren't sitting at home, we're on the go and for some of us, these are phones, where we might get a call.  The original save system was intended for a console, not for portability.  A save state would help us immensely.  Third: As far as I can tell, there are no graphics or sound options.  Now I understand that only so much can be done with an old game like this, but it would be nice to have options for scaling and some means of adjusting the volume of the game itself.  Overall, I give this a two-star rating.  Chrono Trigger may be legendary, but this port is only so-so.",2,0,1.0.2,2013-07-19 14:53:35,,

How does it run on Android?  The graphics are significantly improved over the SNES version, but we've been absolutely spoiled by FF's Android debut with FFIII, and other games like Chaos Rings. The touch-screen implementation is pretty dang weak. You lose a great bit of precision with the 'auto-stick', and the battle system is sloppy and takes a while to get used to (i.e. pressing the enemy you want to attack does nothing - you have to press the ""Target"" button to switch enemies). It's hardly broken, but I can't help but feel the development team could have knocked out something better in half an hour. Once you get used to it, you'll be fine. The DRM is insane. You must have an internet connection to start the game, and the internet connection must be active at all times. Why? Because the games downloads portions of the game as you play. This does stop a few hours in, though. Square-Enix completely knocked it out of the park with FFIII in terms of execution, and they set the bar incredibly high for themselves.

Not a dealbreaker, though.  2. Online authentication required to start the game.  This irritating as you need to remember to launch it and switch away from the application if you intend to use it anytime you are not able to be online (such as inside an airplane!).  The Ugly: 1. The game does not download all the cache files you need at once.  This means you can't play more than about 1 era at a time before needing to go online again, which makes playing it anywhere with poor or no cell signal impossible.  Irritatingly, the first time it does this to you is right before the first time you can save after time travelling causing you to lose all progress.

The touch screen menus are a bit awkward but eventually I got used to them. I like the new translation — I didn't play the DS version so this is my first experience with it. The biggest hiccup is the sound emulation. It's obvious the background music is looping digital audio files from the soundtrack, because they loop a couple of times and then fade out before restarting. It's obnoxious if you are listening to a particularly long loop. Some of the sound effects play incorrectly; others feel very low quality (like the gate warp sound).

However, I couldn't get past the name entry screen without encountering a porting oversight. Enter your name? When you begin typing, it inserts before Chrono without deleting it. I had to hook up a separate keyboard just to get the cursor to move to where I could delete the other part of the name. The porters didn't anticipate running on a device without a set of arrows, which is odd considering that the directional pad doesn't move Chrono: you have to use the on-screen joystick for that.  The on-screen controls are clumsy. It's hard to know whether you're going to move or use the ""action"". Of course, this is all irrelevant if you invest in a micro-USB or USB-OTG gamepad, but for many phones and tablets this game is barely functional.  I haven't proceeded far enough into the game to know if the rest of the functionality works. At the point where an android SNES emulator and a CT rom perform better than the native app, I'm not sure I care.

Great time for gaming/reading/etc, but if the save points are too far away, I play the same part over and over and over again.  Not much fun.  Fortunately, there is a very simply solution.  Keep the in game saves as is, spaced so far apart means you have to be careful in fights.  Add a ""exit save"" and ""open load"" function that only saves state when the app is not open, but does not allow you to abuse the save.  Seems fairly easy, and it'd be the best of both worlds!  Also, minor niggle, the whole app should be downloaded at once, or at worst, perhaps a separate in game download for each age.  If I'm on the subway with no signal, and try to enter a new area, the game just exited, without allowing me to save.  Kind of bogus.  Not currently worth $10.
