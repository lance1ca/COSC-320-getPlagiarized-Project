Will I could ""tap"" on an item on my inventory, and get stats, instead of holding item with my finger. Example -- if I am comparing armor, and I hold an item with my finger to get values -- the information I need is under my finger! That is awkward. 4. Not sure what the purpose of the store outside of the dungeon is, seeing that I have no money when I start -- and I seem to be unable to sell any of my starting items. I am also apparently barred from leaving dungeon to go back to the store... so am I missing something basic here, or does that need to be fixed?  Despite my wish list, I love this game.

How about like when u lvl up your stats you go in class side for example if i level up 10 points on speed i become rogue or 10 on health i become paladin and then you unlock that classes ability like go stealth or shield for 10 sec. And please make it multiplayer like you are in city taking quest and then you go to dungeon and can choos go solo or coop.

Its really great. BuT apperently everytime I try loading I get sent outside the map and I cant progress in the game and its sad because I get really far and I close the app. When I come back it loads outside the map and I don't like that at all because it keeps happening.

I play it a lot. But there is a very annoying glitch when I load a previous level I spawn outside of the map and I can't move. Then I have to delete the map or use a teleport scroll which I don't always have. It sometimes works if I use another scroll but it barely happens. Idk if it happens to anyone else but plz fix it. Also sometimes when I create a level it doesn't show the white words so when I go over an item it doesn't tell me the stats of it. This game is very fun though,5,0,0.66,2012-11-06 12:14:53,,

Everything dark; massive struggle. 2) Look/Turn control conflicts with Action UI Buttons. Several instances where my view tweaks out because I touched between the two action buttons and the game registers it as ""look over there!"" 3) Item distance vs. what I can interact with. While gameplay is fine, I found myself on several occasions trying to pick up an item barely out of my reach. With this, I thought it'd be a fine addition to still be able to hover over items, but to have the text read ""Item out of reach"" or something instead of looking around everywhere. 4) More turn and look bogus. While dragging from the right side of the screen makes a fine look around (going left), turning right is just a silly struggle. Perhaps make a fixed drag distance to register turning (so it's balanced) and maybe a ""joystick"" UI. The game is great on PC, but I really want to see it nailed down on the phone. :)",4,0,0.61,2012-07-22 10:28:34,,

Randomly generated dungeons are wicked too! My only request for improvement at this point is to perhaps make the attack and use buttons a little bit bigger. Now that I don't get stuck in behind a ladder with three spiders attacking me and the game not recognizing my frantic attempts to defend myself, it has become a blast!!! Awesome game :)",5,1,0.53,2012-05-02 08:43:29,,

But cool to see a start sreen like title for starting and loading game so u dont have to start over.  But all in all very very good game but diff work in progress it was worth the 3.00 and maybe seven stars if could give. Keep it up;-),5,2,0.5,2012-04-27 04:32:36,,
