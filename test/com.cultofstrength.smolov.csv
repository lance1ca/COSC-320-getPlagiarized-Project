For example, the program is 80kg on Thursday for 10 set of 3 reps but I can do 85kg, and have to manually adjust every set. I would love to adjust number of rep in a set. For example, I failed to do 7 reps in the 4th set. Have to jot down in the Note area, which is difficult to review",3,0,1.0,2020-12-20 00:38:24,,

Okay I see my mistakes now. I'm sorry for the bad review before - have 5 stars.,5,0,1.0,2020-01-14 14:56:13,"The rounding is intentional.  By default it's set to round to the nearest 5, which makes sense if you're working in pounds based upon the plates available to load the barbell.  If you're working in kilos or just want a different rounding factor, that can be adjusted in the settings.

Many users like the way I display the sets.  Sorry you don't.",2020-01-07 16:35:33
