But the gameplay is a let-down for me, I tried it with a PS3 Bluetooth controller when I first read Pixelbite's update description mentioning ""Improved key-mapping for controller support"". I can confirm, it has NOT been improved, unless you use an XBox controller to play it. Using a PS3 controller, the only thing that works with the game is the left stick, nothing else. No boosting button, no fire button, nothing. So I tried it with touch controls, I thought that it could be more enjoyable that way. Man, was I wrong. It gets to be even worse. Too much precision required to play it using touch controls. One other BIG issue is the ""HD"" graphics. When I was playing it with my controller, I noticed frame drops and my controller's commands reception delay from the game. So please add PS3 Bluetooth controller Profile (and PS3 button icons) and optimize the HD graphics for the Tegra 2-based Transformer TF101 and I'll give this game a 5* review.",3,0,1.0.4,2013-05-10 02:33:55,,

I love the sense of speed and get tingles when I hit the boost. The polarity thing is interesting to and the tracks are superb. However the handling is horrendous and i've done about 50 races in phase 1 to try and get it down. Tried all three control types and various sensitivity settings and still couldn't find a happy medium. It's always too clunky or too extreme.

Graphics are awesome, the music is pretty decent, and the energy system is a nice breath of fresh air. Why only 4 stars? Controls can either be tweaked to be either too responsive or not responsive enough. Perhaps remedy this with native gamepad support? I'd kill to hook this up to my TV and play that way. Also, there needs to be a better indicator for polarity changes. Whilst playing, I look straight off into the distance to know what's coming up, only ever occasionally looking at the area surrounding the vehicle. I know the edges of the screen change tint, the colour on the ship changes too, and a small text box comes up with a coloured notification. However, none of these do a great job indicating the polarity change - especially in the heat of the moment. I suggest maybe an almighty glow surrounding your vehicle? Not only would it look great, but it would also stand out more. I would not need to take my eyes off the race if I could see out of the corner of my eyes that my vehicles' glow changed from an intense red to a stunning emerald green. Or even have the track lines change colour. Great game, but address these issues, and it's a definite 5 stars and classic status!",4,1,1.0.1,2013-04-07 18:13:24,,
