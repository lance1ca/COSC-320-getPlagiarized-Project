The drifting almost gone after the update. I wish there was an option which we could increase the screen's curve to have a higher immersion. I also noticed when there is a fast pace \ action scene in the film or when I move my head there is a frame drop or shadowing. Also the 360/180 interface is very close to the top of the screen and easily triggered because it is exactly in the top center and you tend to hold your head on the center more rather than the sides.,5,1,2.5,2015-09-12 00:03:29,"Thanks for the review! Have you tried changing the vertical position of the UI for 360/180 videos in the settings? Haven't seen the shadowing my self, but maybe you can try with/without ""Enable EDS"" in settings?

Curved screen is a great idea!",2015-09-14 22:59:19
