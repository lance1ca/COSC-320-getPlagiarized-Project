I reinstalled it, and it reverted to a save from 7 hours earlier. I'm not going to replay 7 hours to continue. That's really not acceptable. The game is fun, but every part outstays its welcome. It parodies lots of different games, each of which is fun for a while, but then it just keeps going for another 30-60 minutes. I get it, it's very clever, but I don't want to spend half an hour playing an endless runner. The part where you solve puzzles in the library was done very well in that regard. You only had to do 6, but got a reward if you finished all eight. More of that, where if it's your thing you can choose to do more, but if it's not you can move on with the game. I wish there were other examples, but that's the only one I can think of. Every other time, you just have to keep slogging through till they move on to the next game type. Also too much ""go find all 5 keys from anywhere in the world before you can move on."". Ugh. People gave the game props for being a 20 hour experience, but too much of that is just very boring, tedious filler. For to much of the experience, I wasn't having fun, I was doing chores. (Literally at one point you have to earn money by doing chores.) In conclusion, the fun parts were fun, but there was way too much boring work in between. If it had been a more enjoyable experience I might be willing to replay the hours that got deleted. But the prospect of having to go through the tedium a second time to continue playing? No thanks, I'll just move on.",2,0,1.0.8,2018-12-11 18:09:42,,

Which makes it all the sadder that Evoland 2 is a raging dumpster fire. The controls are absolutely horrid, moving across the screen as they please and getting stuck randomly which causes you to either run in place, do a stutter step or stop moving entirely while the attack controls get stuck in charge attack randomly and if you try to rapid attack freeze up and won't let you attack at all, when combined with the horrid movement you miss a.good 60 percent of the time because your character simply refuses to turn when you tell them to, this also makes doing puzzles almost impossible, you can do up to the jail in about 45 minutes and spend 2 hours there because they want you to be dead on precise and the controls just refuse. There are graphical glitches constantly be it the constant lines from improper tile layering, to crucial puzzle solving elements simply not spawning in requiring restarts, and even massive areas of map having no texture and being only a black void. Amongst all these garbage things stacked together though is the most annoying game breaking thing to go with them, the horrendous lag and freezes in any fight after the first future arc. Particularly with the plum boss fight, not only does the screen adopt a headache inducing fuzz filter, she begins.lobbing bombs and rocks everywhere while.jumping around with a shield on. The game has an a solute heartattack here, every time she jumps, the screen freezes and then when it unstuck all her bombs are already exploding, dealing anywhere from 10 to 20 damage in rapid succession, the closest I have gotten to beating her because of this is one hit before 4 lines of bombs were lag thrown and exploded all at once.",2,0,1.0.8,2018-10-21 00:02:10,,

If you find yourself unable to play due to extreme lag when the 3-D portion comes up do your best to struggle through the roughly 10 minutes which should be probably 1 minute of cut scenes and move out to the world map and crawl your way to Bibi's. Once there the game will auto save. Quit to the main menu and in options change the 3-D graphics from maximum to average or low. Average will probably work until you get to the sidescrolling platformer and then there's more performance issues to where low graphics will be your only bet. It's because of this graphical performance weirdness I can't rate this 5 *'s, otherwise, I'd say it's worth the purchase as a decent follow up to the first one, although there's no turn based element so far if that's a deal breaker for you (doesn't bother me, the game play is more fluid than the first).

Maybe make the touch area for the buttons bigger but keep the buttons the 
same size? It feels like you have to hit the exact center of the attack and 
jump buttons. I feel like the controls are more dangerous than the enemies 
and bosses I fight. Especially the rooftop level that was almost impossible 
to pass with the current controls. Also what is up with the jump button 
disappearing and forcing me to close the app and reboot? All on all I love 
the game still, I love all the nostalgia, and the witty jokes that retro 
gamers catch. With a little bit of TLC on the next updates to fix these
