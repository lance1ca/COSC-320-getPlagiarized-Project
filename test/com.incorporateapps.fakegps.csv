I would prefer to set the location by long pressing on the map and to use the double tap to zoom in. Just like in any other map app.  Why reinvent? And if double tapping is not that accurate,3,7,4.9.1,2017-07-16 01:49:49,Double tap is an old design for maps before pinch to zoom was included. In the former maps app double tap was the way to add to map. There are also the zoom in buttons so there is really no need to double tap to zoom anymore. It would be great if you can re-review the app taking this into account. Thank you.,2013-08-19 15:08:53

Worked great the first time I set it up and any questions I had were answered to the fullest in their FAQ section. I promise you, any bad review that you have read about this app is user error and not the app. They either didn't read the FAQ section, email IncorporateApps with any questions or problems they had, or both and tried setting it up themselves without the proper knowledge to do so. Thank you very much IncorporateApps for the awesome products!!! And for all you idiots blaming the app for your limitations and giving the app a low rating because of your incompetence, learn to follow directions, it isn't that difficult. I'm running both paid versions of this app and the routes joystick app on a rooted and unrooted phone both upgraded with the 7.0 patch and it all works on both for Pogo.

Up until Google updated and i started using a Galaxy Note 5. Now, no matter what method I use, clear data, disable wifi location and all other recommended tips for setup...it just doesn't seem to work, especially because it's not recommended enabling Google improved location accuracy, instead of the plain GPS ONLY...which defeats the purpose. Right now, no matter what I do, it doesn't seem to work...with recommended settings, Maps doesn't register my location on top of other apps i use, in conjunction with this, to ""fake"" my location. - 2‚≠ê It worked perfectly on my Galaxy S4 & Tab! I just don't think Google Location services want you spoofing them anymore... It was PERFECT for a number of GPS related ""hacks"" involving reward programs. Don't let my preceeding comments persuade you otherwise, this is the PREMIER GPS APP. Firstly, to further improve the movement aspect, regarding the timeout, include an additional time selected randomly from within a user defined range. Recently a major gripe appeared out of nowhere and I'm not sure what triggered it. It's the fact that I'm no longer able to choose specific GPS locations (Long / Lat) based on coordinates... But instead only exact street addresses. Example, I used to be able to long press an exact spot on the map, within a shopping mall. I could place myself inside, in the food court. Now, no matter where I press, the popup reads the closest street address.   Which now means, when verifying my location using a map program, my mock locations always fall directly on a road, as a street address...so if I want to appear in a shopping mall, it's impossible. It instead shows me on the street next to the mall, not within it...3 stars until fixed. After messing around with various settings and the order in which they're cleared, reset and enabled..i can't seem to return my device to its previous working state, where the location within the Fake GPS app, is identical to my fully updated Google maps. Currently, the engaged game location is almost a half mile apart from the map app. Easy 5‚≠êwhen they fix it or I get it working!",3,3,4.8.6,2017-04-26 14:09:45,,

Thank You Devs! So I have been following a certain games development for 5 long years.  It was due out on my birthday this year, but was released four months late.  Figures it would come out a week after I had major surgery to rearrange everything in my abdomen and chest.  Think something like that stopped me? Heck no! I ran out with my kids and played. Ten days later I was hospitalized for my stupidity and now I am on bed rest for a month. So yeah, I spoof to the park 5 miles away.  I get the same crap over and over, but I'm less bored than I was without it.  Using an LG K10, heres how it worked. Mock Location on.  Start Fake GPS. Login to game app.  When you see the Location Error, switch screens and toggle Mock locations off.  Go back to game app app. When you see GPS error, log completely out. Close window, restart game app.  Now you should be in the location and see everything and Mock locations is still off! Theres occasional GPS errors.  Let them resolve themselves or toggle mock on/ off again.
