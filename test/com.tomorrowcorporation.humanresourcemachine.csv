In a series of fun exercises of gradually increasing difficulty, the player must transfer numbers from the office in-tray to the out-tray, performing operations on them along the way.  As one progresses through the exercises, new operations and features are introduced that make it possible to write more powerful programs. One can store numbers, increment or decrement them, and even use simple arrays.  The player may not realise it at the time, but he/she is effectively learning simple assembly language programming.  The exercises are made significantly harder by the presence of challenges to optimise the solution for program size and number of executed operations. Very often, these goals are mutually exclusive and will require two separate solutions to achieve.  In short, this is a brilliant game that will provide hours of pleasure; and not a few of genuine frustration and head-scratching, as one strives to shave the last few operations off a program to reach the target optimum.",5,45,1.0.2,2017-01-15 18:18:04,,
