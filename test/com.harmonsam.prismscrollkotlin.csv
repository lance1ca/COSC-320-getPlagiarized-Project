They have way more options than us android users are capable of and for a DnD player that's really unfair. I want to be able to create my character the way I want to and having only few options to choose from is insane. Please come out with an update that's fair and let's us get what they have. And they didn't even have to pay for it we did. Its ridiculous prismscroll. Please do this fairly.,2,10,1.4.5,2020-10-02 23:00:57,,

I tried to make a druid but found only one cicle was allowed. Very little to work with on the app. I hear this is awesome for ios but if you have a andriod dont get it. Untill it ether updates to allow access to what ios has. Ill be looking for another way to build my charater sheets.,1,2,1.4.5,2020-04-01 14:23:53,,

It's kind of sad you have to pay for this when so much is left out. Only 1 background. I hear this is killer on iOS but the Android version if compared to fight club 5e, or squire pro it's so sad.
