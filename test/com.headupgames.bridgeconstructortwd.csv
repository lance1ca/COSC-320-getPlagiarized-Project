The bugs I've experienced mainly are in the building of bridges. I'd drag a set of planks or beams and hit play just to find out my bridge disappeared. Then there would be some graphical glitches here and there. And finally sometimes hitting play doesn't even move the vehicles.,2,22,1.1,2020-12-01 21:12:49,"Hello Tomasz, thanks for the feedback. This is a really strange issue. If this happens again could you please send us a log file? In order to do so please go to the main menu -> ""options"" and then tap with two fingers on the screen for ~5 seconds (without moving the fingers). In the window that appears tap ""send"" so we can get the log file.",2020-12-17 08:14:16

There are characters from The Walking Dead that have skills you set as part of the level, zombies to wipe out, parts of the level to move, lots of little extra physics puzzles. I get that this is mobile pricing but this game is really great and worth so much more than the measly $2 they charge. This game also just came out on PC for 5 times as much and is the same exact game and totally worth it. This mobile price is ridiculously low for such a great game.",5,23,1.1,2020-11-29 14:44:13,,
