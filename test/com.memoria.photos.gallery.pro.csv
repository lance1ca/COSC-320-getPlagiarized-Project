Except I really dont understand why the app cant access my screenshot folder. I can open screenshots from another gallery app but as soon as i close them the screenshot is nowhere to be found in the Memoria Gallery.

We are really sad to hear this. We tested the app on many devices and none of them was hot. Regarding speed, this is just first version, more improvements are on the way. For SD, you have to allow permission. If you want, join our G+ community, explain exactly what issues you are experiencing, so we can fix them asap!
