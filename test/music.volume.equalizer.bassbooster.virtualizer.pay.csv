It works great with Rhapsody and Spotify. I had no trouble with having to readjust settings after each song. I'm using it on an ASUS Zen tablet with Lollipop 5.1 connected via Bluetooth to a Monster Rockin' Roller 2 speaker system. I give it 4.5 stars because I wish the equalizer had 10 bands. Over all it is a great purchase!,4,0,1.1.6,2016-01-13 22:40:01,,

Love the interface that seems to float above the background app, such as Pandora.  Access to the equalizer from the notification bar is great.  I can make adjustments without feeling like I left my music app, hoping I can find my way back to it. The next best feature to add would be automatic detection of the music app starting and stopping so that it doesn't have to run when it's not needed. Currently I'm using Locale to do that for me.",5,0,1.1.4,2015-09-28 17:04:59,,
