I have to say that in the last year I have noted a perceivable degradation in sound quality.  The equalizer and pre-amp functions are essentially useless except with the most ancient mp3's of songs from decades ago. The only reason it sounds adequate is that I have Dolby Atmos on my Note 8.  Since the Samsung One UI update, every single press of a button or action interrupts the song play.  It was horrible at first but has diminished a bit since the May 24th update.  I don't know if that is a JRT or Samsung problem, or both.  The ability to delete songs on external card is far more convoluted than previous.  The navigation to do so is a disaster.  I hope to see vast improvement in next release or I will move onto another player",2,2,10.4,2019-07-25 15:32:52,"Hi Gern, sorry you are running into issues.

If there's something you don't want in the library (such as your ringtones,) there's no way to remove it without deleting the source file.  I've emailed JRT about it, and they suggest I go through and include only the folders I want.  In my situation, that's very cumbersome.

""there's no way to remove it without deleting the source file"" isn't really true. As stated, you can just not scan the folder with that file.

But I wanna say that needs a bit more volume power, the 10 band equalizer makes the music sound cool. Needs a bit more improvement on gain and what about adding Middle and Trebble to go along with Bass and Preamp. I use other premium app, but, Rocket has better high level EQ even with quiet volume.",5,0,4.4,2018-01-18 13:46:11,"Thanks for the good review! If you want more volume gain and less headroom, you can bump up the preamp. Personally, I lower the preamp down, and then raise the EQ sliders higher, then turn the volume on my device louder, resulting in more amplification with less distortion.

A couple of questions: I've upgraded my phone from a Samsung Note 4 to the Note 8. I also upgraded the memory card from 128G to 256GB, primarily for more audio and video. I copied my audio and video directories over to the new removable Memory card. In doing so, i lost all my Playlists. After repopulating my playlists, which was incredibly slow (more on that later), I now am having trouble playing my music from the Playlists. I get a message to open Settings and toggle SL under the Sound option. Even after the reboot I get the same message to toggle the SL option. The Album plays perfectly through the Album view. Any thoughts on this?  About the populating of the playlists, is there any way I can go to the Album (song) view and select multiple albums to add to or create a new playlist instead of doing it an album at a time or a song at a time?  Last, to re-request an option to rewind back 10 seconds and skip forward 30 seconds for audio recordings? Presently it's only moving the slider up and down and quite arbitrary.   I still love the app was much as I did when I first got it several years ago. Keep up the awesome work!! Thanks!!",5,1,4.4,2017-11-01 16:39:31,"Hi Dan, 

Open Rocket Player, then go to ""Menu - Settings - Sound - Open SL"". Once there, what we want to do is reverse whatever the current setting is, then reboot your device, then try playing again. 

Email me at MusicPlayer@JRTStudio.com I can answer all of these questions for you. My responses are character limited.

Very simple but effective design where I can choose exactly the layout I need.  Also the gapless playback is just what I need.   The app reacts fast and is absolutely stable (in my experience).

(problem now solved) BUT I can't select an folder from external sdcard, it doesn't add the songs (rescan stops immediately). I think it's because your app doesn't ask for permission to have access/modify data for the permission manager (like for example file explorer) .  Happened since I flashed to android 7.  Phone is a rooted galaxy S4 with Android 7.1.2  Edit:  sadly reinstalling did not the job, the permission manager asked correctly for access, but still no import from sdcard.  But with that I revisited the library settings and the ""ignore .NOMEDIA on sd cards"" was checked (what I thought would do the job) but I had to check ""ignore .NOMEDIA file"". after that with both checked everything worked fine again and the import from external sd works correctly.

This is by far the best music player for Android I've used (and I've tried several!). If you liked using an iPod in the ‚Äò00s, but prefer Android over iPhone now in the ‚Äò10s, then Rocket Player and iSyncr are for you. You can continue using iTunes as your music library software on your PC -- iSyncr can read your iTunes music library files and sync playlists, artists, albums, and podcasts to your Android phone and Rocket Player.  The playlists can even be read by other music apps on your phone. Rocket Player is very powerful, well-designed, and has many good features. It's very easy to create new playlists (including programmable ‚Äúsmart‚Äù or ‚Äúlive‚Äù playlists) on the app and shuffle them.  And when you sync back to your PC, iTunes will see any new playlists you made on your phone and import them.  You can also designate any long audio file (like a lecture you recorded) on your phone as a ‚Äúpodcast,‚Äù which allows you to bookmark (or remember playback position) that file.  The premium version of Rocket Player will play high-end audio files like FLAC and Apple Lossless from HDTracks. The developers are very good about replying to tech support emails.

It's really easy to use and was worth the $4 to play my WMA files too. Only problem is playback while hooked up to my Bluetooth devices. If I get a text or some other sound notification it stops playing and disappears from my quick pull down menu, so I have to go in the app and mash the play/pause button a few times for it to restart, and then it happens again 20 seconds later with the next text.

Thanks for writing in! 

Configure whether to stop after a phone call, ignore other apps, or to simply duck when another notification comes in. I think you can configure Rocket Player just like you want it using these options.

To do this, go to ""Settings - Sound - Audio Focus"". 

Let me know if that helps!",2017-02-22 22:09:17

But when I got my Order Receipt from google play I saw the price is 5.99USD. I am not sure what exactly is the price of Rocket player premium. If 5.99USD is the actual price then why not to include the price in the tag instead charging the price after payment?

It's the only audio player app that I've found that understands that podcasts aren't music and that a podcast isn't an album. All the other apps I've seen mix up my podcasts with my music or insist I only get my podcasts through them.  However there are a few problems:  1) Rocket Player doesn't work well with Bluetooth headphones. It often ignores 'play' & 'pause'' commands.  2) There's no ability to rewind or skip back a few seconds.  3) There's no control over when or how the podcast description is displayed.",4,0,1.1.1,2016-10-05 12:21:00,"Hi Daniel, Thank you for your feedback!

I've been using Rocket Player Premium since I got my phone in September 2014 and haven't changed music players since. It's a powerful and relatively simple music player with lotsa cool themes. My small complaints are the wood theme doesn't have banners for where the first letter changes under artists when scanning for an artist. In addition, whenever I go to home on my phone or put it to sleep while music player is playing, if I re-enter Rocket Player it is not where I left it and it is back to the artists page. I also wish that the search function for typing in was dedicated in a spot on the interface rather than the obscure place it is now. Lastly, my biggest complaint is how they got rid of the free album art search feature that they used to have and the old lock screen that used to allow you to fast forward and rewind (without a separate locking method). If these things were fixed/put back to the way they were, this app would be pretty much perfection!",3,0,1.1.1,2015-06-03 22:52:40,"Hi Nathan!

Rocket Player does support USB OTG, if the device natively supports it. However, some devices do not natively do so. I think Android M is going to fix that.

It's one of the best players; it looks clean, has very customizable playlists, and has a pretty intuitive UI.   That being said, the paid version of this app seems far less stable than the free version. I've been having consistent problems, on both the phones that I've used it on, with album art and general performance. Whether using a third-party downloader for art, or the in-app function, album art regularly fails to display. Sometimes it works, but more often album art doesn't display properly.   In addition, the paid app crashes regularly. I'd say that it crashes (becomes unresponsive and eventually closes itself) 1-2 times per day for me. Aside from the crashing, the app often 'lags', especially when changing songs. This process should be pretty seamless on an SGS5, but for some reason the lag is a constant annoyance.   The lock screen controls disappear too, but I think that's an issue with my device, rather than the app itself.",3,0,1.1.0,2014-09-18 10:13:04,We're sorry to hear that Mike.

This lag is also noticeable  when moving the bar to access differents times on a podcast file, in other applications like Google Player this is done almost instantaneously). 2) The bar for navigating within a long file (eg. 2h) is too small and not very sensitive, there is a lot of lag time.

After considerable research of the many alternatives out there, very happy to report that my decision to give JRTStudio's  iSyncr  + Rocket Player Premium Unlocker  a go was totally worth every penny (all  798 of them).  That's roughly 2 cents per day for the year.  I used the WiFi sync option with my Win7 PC and had zero issues syncing my entire iTunes library to my new 64GB Sandisk Extreme MicroSD card.  I thought the free player sounded very good but the premium unlocker takes it over the top with the 10 band HQ equalizer.  Couldn't be happier with this setup.  As a recent Android convert, I was initially just hoping I could find a 'decent' way to use my new smartphone to play/sync with my iTunes library ... but I ended up finding a solution that actually exceeds what I had with Apple previously.  Very smooth, easy to search thru everything, no adverse impact on battery usage, and best of all, a very enjoyable high quality audio experience.

Continuing to re-posts your review is not going to solve this issue.

The issue you are seeing only occurs with the 5-band low quality equalizer, correct? The 5-band low quality equalizer can have issues caused by Android on some devices.

Please email MusicPlayer@jrtstudio.com for proper support.

The gapless feature uses the information stored inside the file to play gaplessly. I have Dark Side of the Moon on my phone, and it plays great. I ripped it from my CD using iTunes, if you have the CD, you might try re-ripping it and seeing if that doesn't fix the issue. If the MP3's are not from the same source, it will not work.

At this time, Rocket Player uses the Android Media Database for playlists. Why? Because then your playlists can be shared with other music players. Unfortunately, the Android Media Database does not support videos in playlists.

My choice is to support sharing, or support video playlists. Not both.

Rocket is good, maybe even very good. What you need now is a seachange in interface design, layout, aesthetics and ergonomics to truly stand out from the rest. As an example, have a look at the new Pocketcasts; not saying theirs is perfect, but it is having great success for its unique flavour and simplicity compared to the traditional Dogcatcher/ Beyondpod interface. No need to try and look like a hifi component either, function must lead form, create your own look. Best of luck. Greg",4,0,,2013-05-28 23:01:29,"Hi Greg,

I'm glad you like the player! If you select a song in a playlist and hold down on it, you can select ""Play 1"" to play just that song. Does that help you do accomplish what you are trying to do? Or do you want to move to the next song in the playlist after each finish, but manually? Email musicplayer@jrtstudio.com to let us know.

There seems to be a slight delay switching from one song to the next when pressing the next button from the notifications dropdown.  3. It'd be great for shuffle to actually be shuffle and not random; that is, taking everything in the playlist and putting it in a random order instead of playing songs randomly (which means certain songs may repeat before another song is played).

It's a good start. JRTStudio has been helpful with issues on Isyncr, so I ""trust"" them to continue their good work on this program, and will adjust rate in the future. It's still a good enough player for me to replace playerpro and the stock android player. (I used to use the nexus one player & player pro)  The good: I appreciate that on the lock screen i can scroll to where I want with a song. I like that I can set the times in itunes and it will import the start/stop.  The bad: It needs a little work. I love the isyncr program, so that's really why I got this player. It has been a little bit buggy as it has froze on me a few times and wouldn't load a few other times... had to reboot a few times but it eventually sorted itself out.  The widget is displayed as a 3x1 or 3x2 on my home screen (I have a Photon 4g). I would appreciate a dark colored/clear widget.  I hope to be able to edit ID3 tags soon! (specifically genre tags)  It'd be nice to select which tabs are relevant to me (album/genre/song/file location (not present)/artist)  I'd like if the widget opened up to the default player, instead of the select music menu",4,2,1.0.0,2012-01-26 11:01:01,,
