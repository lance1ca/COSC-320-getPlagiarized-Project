Many free TD games far exceeds this. Fixed tower placements. Graphics are not that good. Story is boring. Tower variety and upgrades also lacking.

But why no sound when towers fire? It really removes one complete dimension from the game. Otherwise... Well done. 4th December. Gave the game another star, as the promised extra sound effects make all the difference. How about another tower? A guard tower would be nice (IE. Produces say 2/3 guys that fight for you at that spot). Though I suppose this might change the game balance too much. Keep up the good work. EDIT 2.

Maybe, improving this by level - normal/hard/expert, so that others who will try it first will enjoy the game, not to be challenged at first play and bored easily. Uninstalling the game for now.
