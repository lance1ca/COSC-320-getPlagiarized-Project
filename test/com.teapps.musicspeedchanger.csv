Make the pitch change up and down buttons much finer resolution since musicians are usually trying to get the song they are learning from up or down to standard pitch which is usually something less than one tone.  Look at the way amazing slow downer allows you to control the pitch. Having to key enter the arbitrary pitch is very clumsy way of trying to get the song you're listening to in to standard pitch.
