The reward for doing math is very complex and boring. Getting refund",2,0,2.0,2015-03-02 13:06:32,"Hi Thea. Sorry to hear the lack of music bothered you. There are sound effects so shouldn't be ""completely silent"". The reward involves winning characters and trading stars for cars to use in a simple game - launch your car as far as possible with a swipe of your finger. Could you tell us which part you're finding complex? Thanks, Ian, KeyStageFun",2015-03-05 09:35:00

This app is not supported by the Nook and when buying via the Nook this should be checked for and the install blocked. Did you buy via the app store on your Nook? We aim to release for Nook soon - hopefully you'll amend your review once we release for Nook and you get to try it out as other reviews suggest this isn't a 2 star app. Thanks.,2013-06-04 09:29:26

Would like to see the tabs and menus the same as other games in the series such as the times table game. This would make it easier to switch from one game to another.,4,1,1.0,2012-09-26 04:41:50,,
