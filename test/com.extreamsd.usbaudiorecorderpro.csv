I wish I knew about this way sooner...It would have made recording live shows a breeze compared to setting up someone's expensive laptop. I really wish that it recorded in mono instead of stereo but realize that might work the Android system harder. It's not a big deal separating the tracks in reaper. Being able to record 8 stereo tracks into an old phone is pretty remarkable. Not enough people in the music scene know about this...,5,0,1.5.1.0,2021-01-24 11:05:33,,

Set to 100%, you loose headphone monitoring during recording. Roll back one or two % & back it comes, but I read it may impact quality.

And it works really well. One SERIOUS drawback is the licensing -which needs to be verified every 90 days. This is generally fine as it is most likely that you will have either wifi or network coverage but if you find yourself in a situation where the license has expired and you need to record something in the field without network or wifi coverage, the app fails -will NOT record.... Imagine having a piece of hardware that is designed to occasionally not work. Don't worry though, this doesn't happen very often only when you have a once in a lifetime opportunity to capture an event. I would pay more for a lifetime license -one that truly turns the device into a reliable, battery powered field recorder.",5,1,1.3.9,2015-02-07 06:01:30,The 90 days limit was only present on a very old version and doesn't apply anymore since a long time.

Audio is loud and clear but there is a faint electronic buzz. Perhaps it's the usb cable or otg cable, I don't know. (I don't get any noticable buzz on the PC with the same usb). As I said, it's faint and can easily be noise removed.   HTC ONE + Samson Meteor Mic - Same as above but with a louder buzz. Still quiet and easily removable.   Nexus 7 (2013) + Shure PG27 - Audio is much quieter than the Samson, but turing the gain high (this mic has gain control on it), you can get a nice loud volume. Also, no buzz. or if there is any buzz, it's so quiet it isn't worth mentioning. This is what I'll be using.  All of those without extra power.",5,2,1.3.2,2014-04-08 09:08:31,,

The app does not recognize that the E17 is plugged on either device.  *EDIT*  After working with the developer I got the E17 to function with my Nexus 7. It's finicky to get it started, but it does work. The trick seems to be cycling through the inputs on the E17 after it is connected to the Nex7. Once the E17 screen says ""LOCK"", this app will recognize the device. The couple of downsides to the software is that it doesn't play audio from any other apps besides it's own, and it doesn't play MP3 files. Neither of these issues are a dealbreaker for me as I mostly listen to FLAC files but it would be nice if I didn't have to change the inputs/cables just to hear audio from a different application.
