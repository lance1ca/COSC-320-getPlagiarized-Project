I was watching my 2 year old play it and when it take as much as 20-30 seconds before the right eggs come up again she just gets bored and starts wanting to hit the other eggs. The developers tried to fix this by adding a speed setting but the problem is the frequency at which the right eggs comes up. That needs to be increased. Otherwise the game looks very polished.,2,45,1.1,2014-06-24 08:49:02,,
