I will preface my further review by saying that I am using the ""free"" version so perhaps I need to purchase the upgrade? I have had it loaded on my phone for quite some time and have used it successfully in the past. The first issue today (9/24/2020) came when I was going through my photo library. I selected a few pictures from a past date that I wanted to delete and the app deleted my most current photos that I wanted to keep! Apparently there is no UNDO feature on this app! Then when I went back into the ""Album"" setting, most of my photos have disappeared and have been replaced by the little green Android figure, and no date for the album title, just numbers like: 3.5 M. I can't seem to access any of my past photos. And P.S. I just now paid for the Industry pack upgrade. Didn't help. I don't see any difference. Second issue came when I tried to send a group of photos to my e-mail address. I chose the export to e-mail feature. It sent the selected photos to my e-mail and the background information was sent and a link to where the photo was taken on Google maps, but NOT the photo itself. So now all the important photos I took the other day are gone! Fortunately, I can go back and retake them. Additional issue: When I used this app before on a Samsung phone, the photos appeared in my regular photo library. Now on my new Google Pixel 4 phone, when I take photos with the Solocator app, the pictures do not show up in my Google photos library. Can't find them. Help!",4,6,2.35.4,2020-09-24 15:16:32,,

The pictures you take will have a lovely stamp on them showing the date, time, location, bearing of the photo.  So far, so good.  Now if you try to use your photos in a map (such as Google Maps) you will discover the ridiculous flaw.  There is no location data for the photo.  So the mapping software doesn't know where it was taken.  No problem, I thought, after using this app on a survey for which I had recorded a GPS track. I can use GPicSync to get the location data from my track, based on the time stamp on the photos taken with Solocator.  No.  There is also no time stamp in the EXIF data for the photos taken with Solocator.  During this site visit I had taken photos with my normal camera app as well.  These worked perfectly - EXIF data for both time and location are there.  My only solution was (ridiculously) to open the images on my PC, read the GPS data from the image, and then manually edit the EXIF data so that is showed the location.  A long and tedious job.  Please please please update the app so it writes EXIF data.  Then it gets 5 stars!",3,0,2.13.3,2018-07-20 05:42:00,"Hi Jim, Thank you for the detailed feedback.

But the relevant side compass readings (actual angle reading to the left & right side of the center  straight on reading) are greatly inaccurate. This condition needs to be adjustable per each camera  brand & each model because each device will have a different overall view angle.   The application needs a function to able to adjust the angles readings to each side of the  straight ahead bearing reading.
