things. First the ambush system is rediculous. Almost every encounter has 
ambush after ambush. There were occasional ones in WH Quest 1 but it wasn't 
rediculous. The second minus is the in-app purchases. You pay for the game 
and then have to pay more for litterally everything. Each character is 3 
bucks. Extra for adventures. They also reduced the amount of gold you get 
to about 10% of what it was in the first game. This makes it so you 
basically can't level your characters unless you do endless grinding or you 
(of course) buy money. The game unfortunately is just like all the other 
pay to play games out there. I was very disappointed with this after the 
great time I had with the first one. If you haven't played the first one

both ends of the map. Experience gain is focused around contribution. So 
your stronger, or preferred characters will continue to leave everyone
