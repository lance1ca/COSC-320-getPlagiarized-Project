Thank you for using edjing Pro! 

Once a track is loaded on the deck, the BPM is automatically analyzed? It is displayed next to the ""Play"" icon. Does it work?

Tracks take forever to load, theres no pitch bend and I couldn't even figure out how to get the track back to start without rewinding it manually. Everything even effects and volume controls are a mission to get to. Just rubbish there are several apps on here you can DJ with that are much better. Only tried it because it was free. Dont know what professional DJ's helped make it because the clearly have never played on anything halfway decent if they think this app is good.",1,0,,2017-05-17 13:49:59,"Hi James,

With the latest 1.3.1 update, it won't work at all.  Every time I try and load a song the app will restart.  I've been working with their tech support for two weeks and all I can say about that is their tech support is either 1) horrendously busy and overtaxed or 2) not qualified.  They don't understand what I'm talking about in my message, which could be OK given that they are in France, and ask me to make a video showing the behavior.  Which I do.  But, they sit on this for a week.  When I finally send them another email asking for at least an acknowledgement that they could view the video, I get:  ""please make sure you are on the latest version.""  I know what this is.  I know how a helpdesk works.  I stated in my email to them that I was on the latest version and they respond with this.    If they had responded with ""We just updated to 1.3.2.  Could you try the latest version?"" it would be a different story.  If they get this fixed, I will be changing my stars to 4.

The app keeps running in order to let you come back without loosing all your setup.

This is the same for Facebook and Google, it allows you to not log in each time you open the app.

When does it crash exactly? While doing what? 
 
It might be a RAM issue. Please make sure to free up some RAM on your device when using edjing.
Could you please try to close all other apps running in the background when using edjing and tell us if it works better?

Unfortunately, you can't import Google Play songs on the app: actually, your songs have to be located in the native 'Music' file of your device.

Our technical team is doing the best to get round this restriction but for the moment we are unable to let you play with Google Play songs :(
