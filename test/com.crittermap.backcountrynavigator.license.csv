Then I load that file into the phone and import it into BCN.  I download CalTopo maps before leaving, and use BCN to help navigate in the wilderness.  I drop a few breadcrumbs along the way to make sure I can find the way back to my camp or my car.  After 30+ years using a map and compass, BCN is pretty intuitive.  It’s like a map, only MUCH better.  The GPS shows me exactly where I am on the map.  It easily shows the distance and heading to my destination.  I can enlarge the map enough that I don’t need reading glasses.  It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it, but it’s a powerful navigation tool, and it just works.

I've been using it frequently since 2013 for both cycling and hiking and it's great. It basically converts your phone into a GPS and, of course, it works everywhere where there's satellite GPS signal (regardless of the phone signal).  It effectively replaces the traditional mountaineering GPS and, while I still carry the mountain GPS as a backup in more adventurous mountaineering, I don't really use anything other than this app. Great for loading and downloading maps (for offline use) of different sources and for any country (which is strikingly easy), for loading GPX tracks, and for recording your own GPX tracks. The maps available are excellent and free. They've managed to give you the option to download some of the best maps provided by each country's main mapping institutions (e.g. OS for UK).

BUT, it falls way short of what is necessary.  It may be possible that I have not been able to figure out some of these features, in which case I would argue that the developer should make these features easier to use.  I did purchase and use the Pro version.  I recently relied on BackCountry Navigator in a mountain hike that was way off the grid.  I did download the correct TOPO map before leaving and I set some waypoints but, I was unable to retrieve the waypoints after I was off the grid.  The map was there.  The actual trail varied from the trail marked on the map  numerous times, sometimes by over 100 feet.  I found that I needed two other apps to give me the information I wanted.  I used an altitude app and I used a popular walking app that tracked time,distance and pace.  It was a pain having to switch between apps while hiking on a rocky trail.  I recommend that the developer add (or make more useful) the following features (and many features related to these):  Altitude,  Pace,  Distance traveled, Save stats locally (for off grid use).  The app should only earn a 5 if it is rich in features.",3,7,6.1.9,2016-07-01 06:22:51,,

I use this app to collect accurate gps ""waypoints"" for later transfer to a custom map of our system.  Also used for personal trekking.  I haven't had any real issues with BCN that are the fault of the app.  With Android 4, there were issues with storing map files to SD card, but with Android 5 those issues are mostly resolved.  That's Android, not BCN.  I've also had issues at times with getting gps readings, but that is issue with my tablet, and again not BCN.  Basically, any functional issues that I've had are not due to the app itself.  This developer is quite dedicated to it, and provides updates on a continual basis.  I've read reviews with complaints about the ""hidden"" charges for maps.  These are false issues, I use both satelite & topo maps that are provided free.

Spent 6 hours off-roading, and battery on my Samsung Note 3 was still at 60% when we completed the trip for the day.  Absolutely recommend this app",5,0,5.8.3,2015-09-08 12:15:56,,

It has helped me not only in the mountains, but also on the freeway and even out of the country.  I use it mainly for backcountry skiing or hiking.  I plot my routes or points of interest in Google Earth and then email them to my phone and import them to BN.  I also do the reverse after a trip.  I often create way points at points of interest and create a track of exactly where I went.  No need for data or cell signal.  Just use your GPS and the maps you downloaded before you leave a cell signal.  I also put the phone into Airplane Mode to conserve the battery (I'm not going to get a signal in the wilderness anyways and the phone stops searching if it is in Airplane Mode).  I just recently used this for a trip to China.  It was not only fun to plot my hotels and points of interest before I left , but I used it a number of times to show someone where I wanted to go since I speak almost no Mandarin. It only failed me on the bullet trains  (I think the combination of the speed and the electric wires above the train would not allow me to lock onto the GPS satellites - this is my phones issue - not BN.

The ETrex is a great improvement over my 15 year old Garmin GPS III, especially because you can download free topo maps into it from GPS File Depot.  I found, though, that the small screen on the Etrex was frustrating to use at times if one has experience using large paper topo maps, which also have their drawbacks.  On an impulse, I recently purchased a reconditioned Nexus 7 tablet for $110 and when it arrived in the mail I downloaded the Back Country App into it.  I am now wondering if I should have purchased the ETrex.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the app interface is a bit intimidating.  So far I have spent roughly 90 minutes learning how to navigate the various menus.  That may seem like a long time, but after you spend some time learning the interface and then using the app, you begin to see what a powerful and flexible app it is.  It has many, many advantages over the Etrex.  If you have a Android tablet with GPS, seriously consider checking this app out before buying a dedicated GPS unit.

This gave me what I needed and worked perfectly on my Nexus 5. The downloading of map sets from different sources was confusing and made me wonder which was the best to use.

With the OS Mapfinder app it costs £1.99 to download a 100 sq.km. tile (roughly 6x6 miles), so for the South of England from Ramsgate to Land's End up to Colchester/Gloucester it would cost around £1,000! With this app however, I downloaded those same maps for no cost at all onto my SD Card, which I can't do with Mapfinder. Also, with Mapfinder I'd have had to buy and download each tile individually (500 transactions!), whereas with this app I simply marked the areas I wanted and pressed Download. Further, whereas Mapfinder takes a whopping 96 seconds on my fast Galaxy 10.1 2 014 tablet to draw a single downloaded tile,  I can scroll across multiple tiles in this app with no lag at all.

Problem 1 - No offline help. None. Nadda. Zip. So you better have memorized everything before you head into the backcountry because backcountry navigator pro only has ONLINE help.  Problem 2 - Code design problem. The app uses SQLite, which is fine. Database is in App data space and your maps are on the SD card space. If you clear data on the App because it is acting wonky, you lose the database. The App code doesn't know either how to write out the database or rebuild itself. So you are basically hosed. This is a really, really fundamental code boo-boo.  Problem 3 - Code design problem. If you can't get a GPS fix after a couple minutes, what should you do? Keep running until the battery dies? Or alert the user? If the software interface to the GPS service is hung, what should you do? Keep wasting battery or alert the user? BCN isn't smart enough to alert the user. Instead it simply runs the battery dead. Very, very poor design for offline use.  Is Backcountry navigator worth the hype? Nope. It's not ready for serious offline use.

I think I will write small app that does what I want and then use it to supplement bcn.,5,0,4.5.5,2012-06-12 09:08:45,,

Creating trips and then stopping and basically all other operations just don't have intuitive shortcuts and visual feedback. It does not inspire confidence at all. Also entire screen blanks and reloads every time you move the map One thing that is good is if you back out of the program it stays running and places icon in tray which is good.
