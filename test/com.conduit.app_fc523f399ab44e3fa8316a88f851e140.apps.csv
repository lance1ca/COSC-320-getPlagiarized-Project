Doesn't reflect new ADP and TC document information. The section about PMCS doesn't give true guidelines or checklist for vehicles. Might as well say kick tires and check lights. Would love a refund but I've had the app 3 days before actually getting into it to find all the information that was incorrect and potentially disastrous if repeated in a board.,1,11,1.185.231.736,2020-02-03 20:03:04,,

I would love a refund also the app opens open and stays on the open screen the background all back us army. It used to work now it doesn't at all and I don't know why. It gives out and error code saying connect to the wifi so I change to different wifi's and restarted my phone twice. And it still stay on the open screen or with the error message. I've tried many times but it just doesn't work for me.,1,6,1.177.221.721,2019-10-01 19:16:12,"Mdog, the App was going through updates on 1 October.  The App is not broken please try again.

Have you also had one of your Battle Buddies check their App also?  It can most likely be your phone itself.  Recommend that you restart your phone and then try it.  It has been checked on 7 different devices on this end and worked every time.  That was with both wifi connections and also with data connections.,2019-06-13 16:39:24

Just having a search function will result in a better review.,3,4,1.161.204.700,2018-09-27 08:56:58,"Adam, a Search function would be counter productive.  The App is designed to prepare to win and pass boards and does not have all the information for each publication.  Most of those publications are over 800 pages long.  If you can't find what your looking for in a Question, you would need to look directly at the Publication. Thank you TOP.",2019-06-08 10:29:59

Had 6 for the promotion board. 
4 answered every question with exact answers from my app. So 4 got their 
Promotion status. But one gave different answers to all my questions so got 
he got a ""NO Go"". And 6th obviously didn't study at all. So definitely 
didn't get probable. So not good for his sponsor either. His 1sg gave the 
sponsor a negative counseling statement on leadership. So make sure your 
soldiers study for board and also study right questions from updated 
material and right place.",5,7,1.151.185.663,2018-07-25 13:39:06,Thank you for your review. Very glad the App helped you at the board.  Hope to continue to help.,2018-07-31 14:09:36
