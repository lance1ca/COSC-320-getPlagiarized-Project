Fongo has problems with certain SMS short messages texting services. For example it will not work with Lyft and I believe the same is true for Uber. Since I use these services in the US I need access to the SMS short message service for account verification.  I only found this out after I purchased the package which is too late and can only be described as disappointing (to be polite).
