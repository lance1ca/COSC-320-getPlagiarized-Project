My suggestion is to have two apps, a Lite version with an ad to support revenue rather than $1 price tag, and then a higher quality, larger sized, paid app. Also would love to see a Wiki app for quests and loot pools by the same developer. Definitely something I would pay for",5,2,1.2.5,2019-01-13 12:28:24,"Zoom quality is compromise with taken storage space and working speed. Not all users has top smartphones or tablets.
