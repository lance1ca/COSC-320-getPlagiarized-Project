Worked reliably on a Galaxy S3, S5, and LG G5 when no other app would, though. Old review below: --- Got a rooted phone? Can't get the free tether apps to work? This is the app you want. It works where the free ones failed, even the popular Android-WiFi-Tether app. It's simple to work with, and the advanced configuration options are easy to figure out. Save yourself the time of searching forums trying to figure out what you're doing wrong with the other app. After months of tweaking the configurations of several free apps I tried this one and was shocked to find that it just worked. One of the very few apps I haven't felt guilty about paying for. (Price paid: $2.50)",3,2,6.3.5,2020-12-07 03:00:41,,

I have been using this app on my Verizon HTC One M8 for a few days now without any problems. I've finally found an app that works for my s-off/rooted Vzn M8! However, using the default settings caused my M8 to hang in an endless boot-loop, but I was able to recover using a TWRP restore so I sent Fabio an email describing what the phone was doing and asked about other M8 users' experiences. He sent me a prompt reply saying that other M8 customers had not reported the symptoms I had, but were using the app successfully on their M8's. So I reviewed my config to correct the improper settings, and my phone came right up with its SSID available for connection.

This is where the problems begin...Fabio knew this was a possibility with my specific carrier causing my exact issue but did not tell me this until two weeks later and then a refund was no longer available through the Play Store directly.  This is a good ploy since it is a relatively cheap program, most people will not bother to try and get their money back at that point.  I understand that this is a paid app and it still not guaranteed to work on all phones from all carriers. However, there should be a trial period so you can test it and work out any issues with the developer before you have to purchase it.  If there was a trial period and this program had still failed I would not have been angry at all.  Also, ANY AND ALL potential issues whether directly caused by the program or external factors (like cell carriers etc...) should be noted in the comments.

He replied probably 3 times and stop responding when I can't do refund anymore.  in the end he was not able to fix it. Waste of almost $3.

I have not had an issue with this app so far. My ONLY criticism is that the internet speed is a tad slower than when you tether/hot-spot with your phone normally (I get first 6gib of tethering/hotspot for free on my plan and that's a little faster than this) but it's not significantly noticeable (still pretty fast if you have 4G coverage.)  A couple of notes to the newbies out there:  1- Look up a set up guide online before contacting Fabio. There are plenty of step-by-step guides on the internet (got mine from Android forums) that will instruct you based on phone. Fabio probably gets thousands of emails, don't bug him if you can answer your own question with a simple google search.   2- [common sense] This app does not give you free internet, it lets you use your PHONE DATA SPEED as a router. So, if you have 2G/3G coverage, you will have 2G/3G speed internet. If you want this app to give you fast internet on laptop/computer/TV/etc make sure you have a 4G data plan.   So far I give this app a 5/5. Good work Fabio, i'm loving it.",5,1,6.0.9,2015-07-27 11:38:45,,

Tethering through my phone company's data plan would have cost $15 per month or I could have gotten a separate wifi hotspot and paid much more and then also have had the inconvenience of having to carry around an extra device.  This app allows me to use my phone as a hotspot when I need it at no additional monthly cost and with no additional devices.  The app's developer is also very timely with responses and will work with you to make sure that the app works with your device (there's also a lengthy configuration page that details the most popular devices).,5,0,6.0.5,2014-10-07 13:32:27,,

Not to mention Fabio, the developer, was extremely helpful in troubleshooting initial problems. Fabio was dedicated and attentive to my needs and worked hard to get a working app. Worth every $ plus some, thanks Fabio",5,1,1.9,2013-03-15 20:16:01,,

The developer of this app was very quick to capitalize on that, and was very responsive to user feedback on the thread. I bought this app because of that alone. I haven't tested it yet on my GSM GNex running Rasbean 4.2.2 ROM yet, but I bought it to reward Fabio for his initiative, and in good faith because he seems to know how to keep his customers happy, and I want a 100% reliable tethering app.",5,1,1.6,2013-03-12 12:50:43,,

The author of this app offered it as a solution on the message board while I was attempting to troubleshoot WTFRU, and I decided to give it a shot. Initially it didn't work, but the author was very responsive, and resultantly, it was the least painful experience I've had getting wireless tethering working on my phone. Bar none.  My personal and heartfelt thanks to the author, since I thought I was going to have to wait until if/when WTFRU was ever updated again (aren't OSS timetables fun?).  To any Sprint Galaxy Nexus users who want free wireless tethering: GET. THIS. NOW!",5,2,1.3,2013-03-11 10:33:11,,
