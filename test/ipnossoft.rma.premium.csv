A big problem is sharing your mixes. When I share a mix with friends who also have the app it won't let them open it. It asks them to download Relax Melodies.

I started using this January or February of 2015 and was so pleased with it, I bought the professional version.  I prefer the sounds of the rain/windchime/wind and listen each night (since 2015) to sleep by. I like how I can customize it to suit what I prefer to listen to. If I want to hear ocean/wind/windchimes, then I can. If I feel like a rain on a city roof or a waterfall, they're there.  The only downside I've had is trying to use the headphone-less relaxation sounds after an update about a year, year and a half ago and getting a buzzing sound when I do. If I click off that box, though, and stick with my 3 sounds, it doesn't buzz so it's all good. I haven't attempted to use them in many, many months.  The new format took a bit of time to get used to (though the lighthouse is very nice as an app avatar) and I was a bit sad to see you had to pay extra for the mediations, but it works very well for what I need it for so that's a huge smile for me!

I had it on my iPhone first, and now I own a phone with android os.  I began using this app because I suffer greatly with a chronic pain disorder, and I also suffer with insomnia and have since I was very young.   I can't tell you all how pleasant it has been to see this app evolve into what it has today. I was so happy when they added binaural beats, then IC tones.  Then, along with all the sounds they keep adding, they added also the timer which has been useful, then the meditations! This went right in line with my therapy. I began taking Dialectical Behavioral Therapy to help me learn to accept my illnesses, (which are more than just the Chronic Pain Disorder, ) and so the meditations began to be a regular part of my everyday battle against pain and it has helped greatly in keeping me on track with meditating and also to be able to meditate on the spot with a shorter meditation during my waking hours to help me re-center myself when the pain takes hold.   I run a page now for chronic pain disorder and for all diseases and other disorders that feature chronic pain. I have for several years been sharing this app with everyone I know, and with people on my page. I encourage everyone to DL this app and purchase the full version for max benefits. Even for those who have a hard time financially, this disorder is highly disabling and let's face it, nobody is getting rich being on disability..   So, I tell my chronic pain community that even if they can not purchase the full version, Ipnos is fortunately for many if us having financial problems due to our illnesses, VERY generous with their free trial version. They are like no other company which tells me they DO care and know that the quality of one's life is so important. They know that if one is not sleeping well or able to take hold of their mind that these types of issues can have very adverse effects on the human body. The mind and the body have to be in tune with each other and when they aren't, it can truly cause things in the mind to reach out and attack the body.   The chronic pain community thanks you for that very generous gift that keeps is going and helps us to repair ourselves so that we may have better days and nights.   Having said this, now that things in my life have changed a little for the better, I will as of tonight finally switch over to the pro version as I have been wishing and hoping I could for so many years now.   Thank you also for keeping very decent prices so that we can eventually be able to get the full version for the optimal benefits. I hope that developers at IPNOS are aware of what a great service you are providing to so many people who are suffering very much.  I also have C-PTSD as many in the Chronic Pain community do. Living life in so much pain everyday of your life causes so much to happen to your mind that shows outwardly and very profoundly. Your app helps us to be able to attain better control of these issues.   I am also became a beta tester of the newest version. I really do love it! My fiancee has tinnitus that drives him up the wall frequently. He would close his eyes and shake his head in frustration of the high pitched droning in his head.   I tried him on the tinnitus portion and it does help him. He has not been able to get ANY relief from it till now. Thank you so much for the work you all put into this app! ❤",5,1,6.4,2017-11-03 21:01:39,,

(1)Can there be a way to sort the sounds or create a preferred short list of sounds? There I sounds I can barely hear even at the highest volume or find abrasive so I don't use (while someone else probably loves them). It would be nice to not have to sort through sounds I know don't like every time I want to make a new combination. (2)Can we get more instruments sounds?

Now after this huge gap, I came back to surrender myself to Relax Melodies and made sure that I buy it! I repeat, that's one of the best $3 I ever spent -- totally worth it. Thanks, Relax Melodies!!  Coming to points of further improvement:  1. Ability to export and import Favorites. Back in free version days, I used to screenshot them all! And probably still need to do the same (now one Favorite at-a-time). You guys can also create an online crowd-sourced library of such favorites in future! This is kind of must-have for me as I create a lot of such recipes and wish to back them up / share with friends.  2. Ability to search through the sounds! Sometimes, I know I want to add some particular sound (say, Zen), but I've to infinitely scroll back and forth till my eyes land onto that!  3. The icons (although they have that tiny unique picture on each), all look very similar. There should be some way to categorise them / customise / change color / group them. At least differentiating musical tracks and ambience sounds more clearly will help a lot.  This is really nitpicking though. I truly appreciate your work and the fact that you keep adding new sounds!

You are indeed right, there was a problem with the coding of the app which sent constant usage stats to our server which increased data usage when not connected to the wifi.

This can be fix by changing the looping mode. 

In the top menu select ""More""
Inside the More section, select ""Settings""
Inside the settings, select, ""Loop Correction Mode""
Select MODE-4 or MODE-5

The isochronic tones and Binaural beats are specifically designed to be played one at the time with your ambiance mix. The reason being is because they have better results this way and your brain will have an easier time synchronizing to them and will stay synchronize longer.

This can be fix by changing the looping mode. 

In the top menu select ""More""
Inside the More section, select ""Settings""
Inside the settings, select, ""Loop Correction Mode""
Select MODE-4 or MODE-5

This can be fix by changing the looping mode.

Inside the More section, select ""Settings""
Inside the settings, select, ""Loop Correction Mode""
Select MODE-3 or MODE-1

Unfortunately it seems a little slow and laggy on my HTC One M7. Swiping pages, pressing on/off for the sounds and especially typing/swyping when I'm naming my favourites all seems to have a mini delay before it registers (same thing with the free version too). It makes going through the sounds a little irritating especially when there's no clear order in the way the sounds are arranged so I'm constantly scrolling back and forth. On the other hand, I've just downloaded the Relax Melodies Oriental and I LOVE how the app works. The scrolling, pressing etc are all smooth and with barely a delay plus I love the updated design and pictures that goes with the sounds. Also it's so much quicker and easier to access my favourites.
