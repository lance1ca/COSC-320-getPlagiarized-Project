There are some features I would like to have though: 1.   The option to display the crosshair temperature under the crosshair or the ability to drag and drop the crosshair. I find it inconvenient in portrait mode to look at the bottom of the screen to read the temperature, it's difficult to concentrate on both the image in real time and the crosshair temperature, if for example I want to focus on a moving object.   2.   Add multiple crosshairs to monitor temperature of two locations/objects simultaneously. Seems like there's plenty of free space in the bottom pane for extra rows of status information.   3.   Toggle to show temperature under max and min arrows.   4.   Remember last MSX mode or an option to configure the default. Everytime I open the app I need to enable MSX mode.  5.   Capture raw data to a snapshot to a known format and a viewer to reproduce frame and interact with it (touch a spot to see temperature)   6.   Capturing Video.  7.   A floating thermal camera widget, would be great to get a preview in the foreground of applications. A home screen or lockscreen widget would also be neat, I know it's possible to view an application activity in keyguard, including previewing from a regular camera.  8.   Option for PIP for real camera over thermal. Similar to the reason I mentioned with having the crosshair temperature under the crosshair.   9.   All features in MSX mode, if it ever becomes possible with the framework. That would include min/max temp arrows, drag and drop crosshair, etc. Would also be neat if it were possible to disable the regular camera in MSX mode so I only have the thermal image/data showing (not talking about the regular camera display on the bottom right).",4,15,3.0.0,2018-02-06 16:48:47,,
