But i wish they gave us more control options for mobile. I want a virtual joystick in the game. Im sure this game can have a joystick added. So please make it available for us. I will give 5 stars for joystick controls.,3,5,1.56,2020-12-09 08:13:29,,

This game has a lot of potential!",5,4,,2020-06-14 22:33:28,,

The controls are great, but the menu/inventory is irritating. Wish the game itself had a bit more to offer. Just slaying everything gets a bit repetitive/boring, and the quest system isn't so great. Would be rlly cool if you could customize your base and world more, maybe with crafting/foraging ect? .. this game has a lot of promise, the combat really is masterful. But that's all there is :( I really hope you guys will add more features.",3,16,1.47,2020-05-17 04:13:02,,
