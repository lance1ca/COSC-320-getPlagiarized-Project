It develops great intuition for geometric properties and logic, appropriate for kids and adults. I recommend it to my community college geometry students, and my 3-year-old also loves it. How's that for range? (To be honest, my 3-year-old will get more out of it when he gets a little more dextrous. It's probably more appropriate for 5+) Update: My child is 7 now, and he still plays it occasionally. He's definitely more tuned in to what he's doing as he plays, and he's using the language that the app introduces. This makes me wish they had introduced a little more vocabulary, for example ""parallel"". He could tell me all about wings, and he knows the word parallel from other contexts, I just sort of wish the app would reinforce the use of the word. Overall, though, I still love it.",5,6,1.1.7,2020-08-23 10:20:20,"Hi Kendra Thank you for a fantastic review, and for recommending the game to other parents and teachers. Happy to hear that your child appreciates the game, and about your thoughts on developing the vocabulary. This will help us continue to develop the product in the future. Good luck with the practice!

I'm also a little bit afraid about the overall lenght of the game. Also S-Pen is not working with this game on Note3. This is valid also for other DragonBox games, but this game would make a good use of the S-Pen.",4,0,1.0,2014-06-02 11:58:38,"Hello Alex, WRT to the game length, we're adding a third mode in the coming update, with more levels. Maybe more in the future. As for having free version, putting purchase in apps is against our policy. Still we're very good at refunding unsatisfied customers (at least on Play)! So just try it !",2014-05-26 09:40:52

I like the way that you don't realised that you are being tested, as  you progress through the levels. This removes any pressure that kids may get in other learning programs, making it a much more entertaining experience.  Once my 7yo starts elements it is hard to get him off it, he enjoys it so much.  More levels please!  Also could you add a way of seeing a summary of all the powers you currently have,  if I have to help my kids, it is hard to work out what powers they have gained while I wasn't watching.",5,0,1.0,2014-05-29 19:57:12,,

He likes elements but was getting frustrated because he was tracing triangles but it wasn't working. I tried and it didn't work too, but then we got it working without knowing what we did differently.   I had to play the game on my own after bedtime to figure out that the monster horns correspond with the triangle sides.   Really wish there were instructions or examples so the kids could figure it out faster.   Would give it 5 stars if it had instructions.",4,0,1.0,2014-05-29 18:54:29,,

Unfortunately, he finished this one in about four days. He was also more of a fan of the three star system from the Dragon box games.  Still great job. How about calculus next?",4,0,1.0,2014-05-27 01:56:27,"Paul, we would have thought that providing 4 days of enjoyment to your 5 years old son, including solving 20+ steps puzzles using only geometrical proof would have gotten us one more star! Hopefully the update coming out in a few days will make you change your mind! :) As for star system and calculus, it's in the plans. No date yet though!",2014-05-27 06:47:32

I've also had some of my struggling students play them with great success. This game was fun and useful, however there is still a bit of room for improvement. First, it felt a bit short. Next, there was very limited in-game help. I understand that part of the process is figuring things out, but some sort of a hint system like the previous games had would be useful. Finally, there is no 'flip side' like with DBA12+. I'd love a flip side that told me which theorems and postulates I was using. Still, I'd buy it again.",4,0,1.0,2014-05-26 19:24:35,"Hello, an update is coming soon with some more help and information. Don't forget to revise your review when it's out!

It helps almost anyone at any age to understand geometry concepts. Young children do not realize they are mastering the abstract concepts that some high school students struggle to master. Amazing graphics and engaging app design make this something even adults would enjoy doing. As a teacher I would give this to 3rd graders all the way up to high school geometry. If we want students to UNDERSTAND their learning, not just memorize definitions and facts that they can not apply, then this is a must have for everyone!",5,3,1.0,2014-05-24 14:26:29,,

Geometry, on the other hand, was always a source of wonder and joy, so I can not understand why the game makes so little sense to me. There are hardly any instructions, no hints, and, worst of all, no clue as to how the solution is to be achieved. So you accidentally stumble through, happen to solve the example before understanding why, and then have to apply whatever it was you happened to do, if you're lucky enough ro remember.",2,2,1.0,2014-05-24 09:46:33,"Eirin, thanks for your feedback! Really sorry to disappoint, we put a lot of love in this game, which will improve over time.

We really hope this can help you out!",2014-05-26 09:26:53
