The onky reason I really didn't give it 4 stars is because It would be nice if it totaled all the games for that session.,4,1,1.12,2020-02-20 21:17:53,,

Everyone does not know how to calculate their score. This feature can aid in learning how to do the math. Thanks,4,0,1.12,2020-01-09 04:36:58,,

It would also bore intuitive if the spare percentage calculation did not include frames that were strikes, and or holes. Currently a low spare percentage could just mean that I striked alot :/ These changes would change my rating to a solid 5 star!",3,1,1.12,2019-12-03 23:07:26,,
