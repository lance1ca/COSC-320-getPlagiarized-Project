encourages you to set PRs every session with target reps. 2 main criticisms 
(feedback points really) are:- 1. Allow the user to make additional custom 
templates with additional workout days and exercises that are included in 
the latter books and to make their own work outs based on ppl or something. 
2. Having different ways to progress assistance exercises rather than just 
sets and reps i.e. using rest pause and total volume. So for example if my 
goal today was to do 50 total reps of chin ups then having counter that let 
me hit 50 with out having to add additional sets would be better (like the 
zero to hero app does). Other wise a good app Edit:- 3. Also, having the

This app is still excellent for 531 but for almost a year now I have used it to log Juggernaut program from Chad Wesley Smith. I run the program with the 'going heavy' addendum and undulating waves. So 10/5/8/3. Juggernaut is similar in structure to 531 but with more attention to volume and frequency. Due to Juggernaut structural similarity this app is perfect to use to track it. I can add sets and adjust weight easily and the maths for 1rm and 90% 1rm are still calculated by the app. Wave results are still logged and monthly progression is to view however it's only every 4 months that you really need to test you new 1rm.

I then moved onto the 531 program now and tried a few free apps before giving in to purchasing this one. All I can say is it's well worth a few $'s and then some.    Update after using it for over a year: 531 Pro is still the best app out there and they continue to improve it. Every time I see an update I can't wait to see what's new. I've turned a few people onto this app and they love it too.  Update another year later:  This is still the best training app there is. They continue to update it. Simply the best $ I've spent on an app.,5,9,12.9,2018-02-21 07:05:46,,

Pro features were all relevant and well worth paying for (Unlike, it must be said, the 5x5 app by the same publisher). In terms of user interface, it looks great - easy enough to navigate. I love the inclusion of joker and pyramid sets - the overview is a great option and lets you know where you are in relation to the programme.  I've been asked by friends and colleagues to suggest consistent programmes and I have recommended your app each time, as the 5/3/1 approach seems to work best and your app makes it almost idiot-proof to follow the programme. All made progress and stuck with it.  My one and only gripe is that I can't seem to edit past workouts - nothing changes. I've been working around this by recording the lifts I did, deleting the workout record for the day and redoing it  with the necessary changes. I'm not going to knock down the rating for this but a fix would be appreciated. Using the most recent version.  As an aside, Jim updated 5/3/1 (And also 'Beyond 5/3/1') with '5/3/1 Forever', which has some great material.

I would really like it more if it gave me the option to type the actual number (weight and reps) instead of using the plus or minus button only. That's super annoying when you're trying to increase weights you need yo hold an unresponsive plus button. 5 stars if you added a feature to type.  After getting a response to my response I've upgraded my 4 to a 5 star. Thanks Dev team,5,3,9.7,2017-08-24 19:54:09,"Hi Kory,
