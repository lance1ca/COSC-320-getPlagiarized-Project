I ran into an issue with one of the game puzzles. The patches where the player has to restore the carpet design. I've solved this puzzle numerous times, but I am unable to get the puzzle piece. I uninstalled it restalled it, I've rebooted my phone. I know it's not an operator error. Perhaps the is a bug to be fixed.",4,2,1.0.1.778.78,2020-11-18 16:19:46,,

This is the main reason for only 3 stars. Other than that, I like it. Developed a glitch in the bonus game that I could not retrieve the flower paint chip from the tapestry in the cabin. It thinks I still need to stitch the patches in place to retrieve the paint chip. I just deleted the game. No point in re-downloading it as I can't change the profile - so the issue will still be there. 2 stars...",2,3,1.0.1.778.78,2020-10-14 20:44:44,,

Have played everything. Totally worth the price, always. This one felt maybe a little shorter and the controls seemed a bit more challenging. I will still be waiting for the next 5bn game and I'm recommending to anyone who enjoys this storyline, try the others as well!!! Best puzzle games.",4,0,,2020-10-12 23:16:21,,
