about the fact that the paid version is exactly the same as the free one, 
it turns out that I was not incorrect. Apparently, there was a ""glitch"" in 
the free version I got, which had 6 castles in both the hard & the easy 
versions. Just wish the paid version had more. Love the game.",5,16,1.2.6,2018-06-30 10:12:47,"Hi Laura, what you describe about the two versions is not true. The premium version offers all 12 castles (6 Easy & 6 Hard). In the freemium you can only play the first 4 (2 Easy & 2 Hard). If you were able to play all 12 castles in the free version, you either paid for the in-app purchase or else there must have been some kind of glitch.",2018-06-23 07:53:58

The graphics are nice and gameplay is smooth. It is easily learned with a good learning curve. Kids will be challenged enough to stimulate their problem solving skills but there are enough design cues to help them work through when they get stuck. Nothing like seeing a 5yo absolutely frustrated that she can't get past a level but just refuses to give up until she solves it! I had an issue with installation of this game (user error) but the developers quickly helped me sort it out.,5,10,1.1.1,2017-12-18 20:44:37,Thanks so much for taking the time to share your feedback Channy!

For the castles to be playable, all previous ones must be completed, because kids need to master certain skills before advancing to more complex puzzles. So, some castles are disabled because you are yet to complete the previous ones.",2017-10-05 10:00:20
