For a professional trainer like myself this app is almost useless. Most of the sounds are not very realistic.,2,2,1.0.2,2015-01-09 12:47:16,"Hi Reagan the app is aimed at pet owners and is an easy tool for them to use. As it states in the app you need a speaker eventually to expose the puppy to volumes similar to the sound in real life. 

All the sounds were professionally recorded so I can assure you they are the real thing. Sorry you didn't find it useful.
