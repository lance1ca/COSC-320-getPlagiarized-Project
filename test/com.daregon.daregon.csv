Ustwo games should probably take positive note of the developer and consider hiring him especially since the guy has been honest and outright states that the game is inspired by Monument Valley. Now coming to the game itself, Daregon follows more or less the same formula that Monument Valley had, so mind bending isometric puzzles are par for the course. Daregon adds some interesting new elements inspired by some other games like Hitman Go to the mix. However, the controls are very clunky and the solutions to some of the puzzles are very unintuitive (Example: Having to backtrack to a preceding level twice to change certain things in the current level). The game also suffers from a lack of music and minimal sound effects. All in all, until Monument Valley 2 comes out on Android, this is a decentish filler if you can grab it for free.",3,1,2.3,2017-08-16 09:56:23,"hi!

It's not in Monument Valley's quality or challenge ballpark. But, it's enjoyable none the less.  Tel Games was amazingly quick in responding to an email regarding one of the levels and Tomas indicated that more levels and possibly an OS update are coming soon.  Hopefully, the new levels will have strictly logic based solutions. Not the frustrating trial and error approach that a few of the current ones utilize.  All in all Daregon is a game worth playing.",4,7,1.3.4,2016-12-19 15:11:48,"Thanks for playing Daregon!
I appreciate your comments and I keep them in mind for improvement.
