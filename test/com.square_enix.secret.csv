Palace), and I will say if anything, SAVE FREQUENTLY. This app will crash 
often for no reason. The only saving grace is the auto-save feature built 
in that has saved my data right before the game froze or restarted (I think 
auto-save is triggered by entering a new room). Secret of Mana is an 
amazing game, but this port has way too many bugs for me to give it a 
decent rating. Worst of all, there is NO CLOUD SAVE. So if you switch to a 
new phone, too bad. You have to start over. Amazing game (5 stars), but 
very frustrating gameplay (2 stars). Edited to add: For those stuck at the 
desert area after getting Salamando, try going into the inn and saving 
first (without sleeping). I also got stuck but it took a few tries to get 
the game not to crash at Kakkara. I had to make sure none of my characters 
had an active fire sabre. Because sleeping with the fire elemental made the 
game crash. Like I said, I made it to the Underground City, so the game is 
playable if you can get unstuck and past the desert. Maybe a combination of 
things equipped, levels, elementals, etc make the game crash at that spot.

When I saw this in the app store I had to have it. Unfortunately this version is barely playable for two reasons. First of all as others have said gamespeed is to fast, seems like the whole game is fast forward. Secondly the 360° wannabe control stick is very bad makes the characters uncontrollable, and together with the game speed makes the game almost unplayable, sadly. A 4 direction D-pad would have been much better. Only gave it 5stars because it's secret of mana, otherwise this version itself is really bad.

I had a hard time understanding which buttons do what, in fact, it seemed I couldn't even start a new game because I couldn't complete Randi's name.  I had to change the gamepad mapping in the options to the other offering.  It seems one of the buttons now did what I needed and I was on my way.

The attack animations and misalignment of your character sprite and the enemies likewise results in numerous missed attacks. This is more a criticism of the game in light of advancements made in gameplay in the 20 or so years since this game first hit stores. Nonetheless, I was always told this game was fun, but I just hated playing it like this. It made me want to play U.S. FF2 or 3 (JP IV or VI), or Chrono Trigger.

The only practical choice is to set them to keep their distance, meaning you have to kill everything yourself unless you want to spend the whole combat healing them.

Changed rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. Thank you!  It feels great playing a port of an awesome SNES game. This is a great action jRPG. For a SNES game, it has nice graphics, an OK story with beautiful soundtrack and interesting gameplay. As you play through the game, you will get different weapons (That you should level up and upgrade) and after a while you also get magic that will make your life easier (It will still be interesting figuring out the enemies' elemental weakness sometimes). The soundtrack of this game is a masterpiece.   Hopefully they will add Cloud Saving, like they did with some of their other games.  (Also, it would seem that there is a sequel  (or prequel) to this game that was released only in Japan, called Seiken Densetsu 3. Hopefully mthey will release this on Android too.

I like the improved graphics on mobile and I like the gameplay improvements like being able to switch weapons from the Weapons Level screen and the 4 shortcut slots. The text was kinda hard to read on the SNES version and I never really found a suitable background for my text boxes, that is much improved in the mobile versions.  There is a bug that I have hit 3 times. In the Water Palace area in front of Undine's cave, the D-Pad will get stuck on the left outside the gameplay area. The only solution I have found is to close it and reopen it. Maybe others have hit this bug and found a better solution? Luckily autosave prevents me from losing too much progress but this bug does not exist on the iPhone version. On the other hand, the iPhone version has leafy decorative borders while the Android version just has black bars, I wonder if the bug is related to the lack of borders.   I give this game 5 stars because it is a great game, because the improvements are worthwhile and because I know this bug will eventually get fixed. I would love to see Final Fantasy Tactics on my Nexus 7.",5,7,3.1.008,2014-10-31 19:12:38,,
