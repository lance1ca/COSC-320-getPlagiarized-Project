The app isn't what I had hoped in the sense of notifications. You can set alerts to be reminded throughout the day but you have to set the notification every day on that day to remind you throughout the day. There have been days that I've completely missed it and forgotten since I am still in the beginning and it is not quite routine to me yet. Regular notifications that remember where you are in the lessons and remind you not only throughout the day but also each day and each lesson with the set amount of notifications throughout the day would be great and help to have greater success in making it routine and not falling too far off track. Other than that I think the app is great and I am very grateful it is available. I'm sure that in time the developer will make the necessary changes so for now I will be using my calendar reminders to notify me.
