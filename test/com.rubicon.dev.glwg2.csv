The main problem I have with game is who i can screen lock it. You can play this game laying on your side, because the screen always rotates the wrong was. This isn't super annoying but it does make the game less enjoyable. In saying that, it works perfectly fine while sitting or standing.",5,13,2.1,2020-07-11 00:10:37,,
