When I pray the Breviarium on my phone, I notice a difference in some of the Latin to English prayer translations (excluding the Psalms) that tend to be more in the vernacular. The translations differ from those found in the 1962 Angelus Press Catholic Daily Missal. The interpretation may be insignificant, but the inconsistency of translation is worrisome. ie; In the Ad Completorium, the Nunc dimittis, Ant.in the phone version: ""Protect us Lord while we are awake and safeguard us while we sleep; that we may keep watch with Christ, and rest in peace.' The missal version: ""Save us O Lord when we are awake, and keep us while we sleep, that we may watch with Christ and rest in peace"" ALSO: In the prayer following the Nunc dimittis, the phone version: ""Visit, we beseech thee, O Lord, this dwelling, and drive far from it the snares of the enemy; let thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace, and let thy blessing be always upon us."" The missal version: Visit, we pray thee O Lord, this house, and drive far from it all snares of the enemy. Let Thy holy angels dwell herein to keep us in peace, and may Thy blessing be always upon us. Through our Lord."" Notice also the capitalization of ""Thy"". There are more, but space does not permit. As unimportant as it may seem, inconsistencies result is confusion and misinterpretation. God Bless You.",5,0,5.5.5,2020-11-01 17:04:04,,
