Don't waste your money. More importantly, don't waste your time! (Graphics were kind of cute though, I'll give it that. still not worth it!)",1,13,,2021-01-11 09:38:25,,

Hints are fairly clear, but if you have issues with problem solving, then you might get frustrated. Story was nice and seemed like it could have gone on for much longer than it did.
