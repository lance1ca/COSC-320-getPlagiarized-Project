I just wish the app would launch to the current calendar month when you open it instead of starting October 2020. Other than that it's great! I use it all the time to plan my vacations (and sick calls) ðŸ˜‰,4,1,4.21.20200830,2021-01-22 16:27:59,,

Notes have been added but not by day just month. Would be nice to have appointments on this calendar. But I understand its a work in process. This is the best postal calendar app that I have seen.,4,1,4.21.20200830,2021-01-12 08:41:23,,
