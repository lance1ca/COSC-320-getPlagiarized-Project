Among the features I like even more is being able to rotate the display. As a camper with a travel trailer, I use this on the road along with a Garmin GPS. But, unlike the GPS, the display doesn't rotate in the direction of travel. An auto-rotating screen and my position towards the bottom of the screen with the direction of movement ""up"" (like a GPS or aircraft RADAR) would be very helpful so I don't have to reach over and manually rotate the display taking my eyes off the road.

I'm not fully certain of the advantage of the Storm Mapper products yet, so hopefully that is cleared up in future releases. The biggest issue still is performance.
