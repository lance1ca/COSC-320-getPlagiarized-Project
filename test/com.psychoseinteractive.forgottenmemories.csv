Would love to see an action game from the same team using the Fog engine. This is definitely a AAA mobile title. Like others said it feels and plays like Silent Hill. I could easily see this as THE resident evil of mobile if they added a guns. Hope to see more of an action game from this studio! Great job guys!,5,33,1.0.5,2019-11-16 13:56:51,,
