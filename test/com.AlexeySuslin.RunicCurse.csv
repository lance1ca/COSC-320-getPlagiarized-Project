Has excellent enemy and boss variety. The combat system makes use of a weapon cool-down system. The controls are simple yet engaging. The various loot feels interesting and the rune system provides a wide variety of spells. It's easy to tell that the author put a lot of thought into the enemies and the combat system. ‚Ä¢ Enemy attacks are consistently telegraphed. The gameplay rarely feels unfair. ‚Ä¢ Every enemy and boss feels very different. Further, most enemies have several different attacks. Bosses typically change attacking style midway through the fight, providing even further variety. ‚Ä¢ The artwork/animation feels great. Some of the enemy attacks are especially clever. E.g., one enemy has a backwards counterattack in response to a forward dodge roll. It should have felt unfair, but it was animated well enough to feel like a skilled technique. ‚Ä¢ The pacing feels excellent. I've had plenty ‚Ä¢ The player weapons each feel different. The spell system adds even further differentiation. Tying spells to weapons means that there was very little temptation to juggle spells in combat, unlike in most similar games. ‚Ä¢ When I took damage, it always felt like my own fault rather than the game's. Not only do most enemies telegraph their attacks, but also enemies have simple enough attacks that players can often perform anticipatory dodges. The maps were also excellent. Different areas feel different, both in art and in theme. Teleportation rooms and help mitigate backtracking headaches. Further, there are plenty of gates and switches to make the world easier to traverse. Such gates tend to have excellent treasure; I never felt like I was wasting my time when I worked on cleaning out the map. If you enjoy Metroidvania games, this is one of the better ones.",5,12,1.091,2020-12-02 19:27:10,,
