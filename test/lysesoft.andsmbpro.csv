Does not work - although manual sync works fine. Tried to register on the forum to get help but registration has incomprehensible question about ""what is your last Android version"" ??? so could not register therefore could not post a question. As I say manual sync works OK but means you have to remember to do it. I gave AndSMBpro autostart permission and exemption from battery management but autosync no go. Also does not seem to support sync of more than one local directory - I wanted to sync DCIM images also another local directory containing call recordings but will not do both. The basic manual sync though works well with Windows 10 SMB v2",4,1,3.0,2020-08-23 11:46:17,,
