Now go back to the camera and choose an ISO number then take a photo. The shutter speed and ISO number the camera used will now appear at the top of your screen. For me the ISO number displayed is always different from the ISO I entered manually. Obviously the app is using auto ISO and ignoring your manual entry. In effect what this means is that the only control you have in choosing exposure is the two steps of exposure correction that can be made using that function. I now have other apps that allow me to set ISO and shutter speed so I know my phone has those capabilities. I would be very hesitant to pay for this app unless you know its working as advertised. What I like about this app is that the controls are at the bottom and to one side of the screen.

But now on my current phone, the OnePlus 3T, it provides a way better photo quality, I would even say uncomparable. It is probably due to terribly bad compression that OnePlus stock camera creates, making photos appear extremely washed out and without any texture to surfaces. Photos that come out of FV-5 are always almost double the size when you set JPG quality at 100%. And don't be fooled, it's not just about numbers. When you zoom in exactly the same scenes taken with two cameras, photos from FV-5 have plenty more details preserved, and due to much lower compression and noise reduction, surfaces have the natural grainy textures and appear much more natural. I used this app on 99% of my vacation photos, with only exception being night photos as this camera don't have any fancy HDR or night shot algorhytms. Yes, there are bugs not related to photo quality, and also viewfinder interface could use some overhaul, but all in all an amazing camera app.",5,14,3.31.4,2017-09-15 02:36:23,,

This app is great for photos, but the consistent bugs really kill it.  One of the major issues I have is, if you leave the camera app open and your screen locks (no third party locks, just the standard phone lock), your phone becomes unusable if you attempt to unlock it. The phone rapidly switches back and forth between the camera app and lock screen. The flash comes on and stays on continuously. The only way to stop the rapid back and forth between app and lock screen is to hold down the power button and do a reset.  A second issue is the random crashing of the app once a photo is taken or when attempting to take a photo. The app will also stay open in the background causing immense battery drain and the phone to get hot.  I've had this app for many months now but it is time to find something better.

No worries if you are taking landscapes. I don't know how many shots I have missed. Hundreds probably by now. Still the same slow speed on my SG7. And yes, this is with ""shoot out of focus"" off.   Second issue. Since I received my S7, this app has been solely responsible for completely freezing the screen for a few minutes when the front facing camera is selected. I don't see any issue on the rear facing selection. Front facing right now is a no go.

It's nice having more controls, and once I upgrade my phone next week, I'm sure it will be faster and more versatile, but so far, I'm not that impressed.    1. Even with my sound turned off, my phone still vibrates when I take a picture. The developer said this was because of how my ROM interacted with camera shutter sound options. However, none of the other cameras I have used (stock, google, camerazoom, snap camera) vibrate when I have shutter turned off.    2. The PNG option is supposedly an uncompressed format. While the phone file sizes are larger, I did a comparison of various photos and saw no actual improvement of the PNG files over the JPEG versions. I took the exact same shots in the exact same light.   Once I get my new phone (upgrading from a GS3 to a GS5), I will run the app through more tests and see what improvements, if any, are apparent.",1,0,3.0.1,2015-12-15 11:00:21,,

I use it more than the original Galaxy Zoom camera app. Some comments, feature requests: -The HD camera pro has vertical/horizontal guides by sensors, and some advanced DSLR cameras have it. It is an easy to make thing but very important. -The interval mode after the update is more advanced but a step backwards, because on the spot, when the camera is on a tripod, it is hard to see the screen on to make several different touches on very small buttons and menus. The most important is a big button to start the shooting for unlimited time. -Also in the interval mode the screen always on. Turn off the screen, for two hours no one want to see the viewfinder, but want to spare battery. -Please add a button for quick custom presets, at least for 5. I very often change flash/colors/focus mode/aperture/etc according to the scene conditions. Would be nice to set and recall custom settings for interval, for landscape, macro and any other. -The aperture priority settings doesn't seem to remember the last setting when the app restarted. -The colors intensity settings could have more room, to even more intensify the colors, like in the built in app. Thanks for all!!!",5,0,3.0.1,2015-12-12 09:42:15,,

Do yourself a favor and go to their website and read the manual.

The shutter in FV5 is press, focus, shoot-so there's always a one second lag, with the android its press, focus......  and you shoot when you release, so you can control the shot better.  Also, remember this is just a camera app, the video is a separate purchase.  Changes I would like to see:  1. Android style shutter release. 2. Image adjustments (saturation, contrast etc) jump from one stop to another and the changes are too extreme, it would be better with a slider or less extreme changes.

If images mean more to you than the usual weekend snapshots, get this app, apply your brain and eye and a little patience, and make something you can really be proud of. (Later) I'm not sure people understand the value of being able to shoot in the .png format. Without any compression, pictures are free of the .jpg artifacts and degraded resolution that kill the sharpness on most cameras. If this little app did NOTHING else (and it does a lot!), making .png available on a phone would be worth the price.

The bracketing will not drop to or below -1. It will get darker but at -1 it brightens back up to 0. By default I usually take slightly dark photos and then post-process brighten them so this is a problem. Next, the stock camera has some built in noise-reduction when shooting at high ISOs, called ""Smart Stabilization"" which I rely on sometimes. Lastly, the camera doesn't rotate with the screen fully. It will go 90-counterclock but not 90-clockways. One of the nicer features is the use of the volume keys as focus and shutter but with this rotation issue, these keys are on the bottom-left and can't be used how much cameras are: with your right index finger.  Besides these issues, I like the manual control of ISO and the option to have a 1-2 second shutter manually. The longer shutter (60s) actually blends together many pictures and reduces the image size from 12.1MP to about 2MP.  Nice app but it has some things to fix.

I tried several things and realized it was when I enable the GeoTagging option that the app crashes as soon as I hit the shutter. I disabled Geotagging and the app works now. I need a good camera app on my phone and so far this seems to be the best one out there. Sure there are a lot of things that can be improved, but I will be patient and wait for this app to evolve (AF could be snappier, and not sure if ISO control is something that is doable on this phone), so now that I got it working I won't be processing the refund.

For some reason I had hoped it would let me change the F-Stop, but that is hardware fixed. Oops on my behalf! Lets me change the shutter speed from 30.0 down to 0.1 seconds, which isn't a too bad range, though I am used to going further (1/100 is reasonable, I prefer up to 1/1600) with my hybrid Point and Shoot camera. Might be another common hardware limitation. Allows ISO settings from 100-1600 in jumps of x2 (i.e. 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600), but my tablets camera can go as low as 50. While the auto ISO mode made good use of this, I would appreciate seeing this get a little more flexible as far as user input goes. A little un-responsive, some short delay between pressing an option button and the relevant 'pop up' menu appearing. Nothing patience can't fix. Once again, might be a hardware thing (processor speeds not quite up to i7 standards in tablets, and all that). There is more to it than that - it's all in the dev's description.  5/5 - everything I wanted in my camera presented at a low cost.

I also like the total lack of bloat (like special effects, etc.)  I did a comparison by shooting a photo of wide dynamic range with low lighting with three different apps: the native camera app (in a Galaxy Note), Camera FV-5, and HDR Camera+.  The clarity and exposure for the native camera and the FV-5 were about the same.  HDR Camera+ brought up the darkest areas, but had less clarity than FV-5.  However, I would not claim this is a scientific comparison.  The beauty of Camera FV-5 in my view is all the easy-to-access camera controls, without the fluff.",5,3,1.18,2012-06-04 18:17:14,,
