The reason for this review is because the app and the developer said IOS and android devices could work together if they were signed into the same account. However that didn't happen. I cancelled the account within a few hrs when my devices didn't work together. But shortly after that the developer contacted me and told me that it could work and they would help us. I tried all the suggestions provided and none of them worked. So after a few days I tried to cancel the account. It turns out the original app refund never happened and so the app was purchased twice. I thought Google provided a warning to prevent you from buying the same item twice but I guess not.

Works seamlessly cross-platform with my galaxy s7 as a parent unit and my iPad as the child unit. Now runs in the background and when the screen is locked hence the updated 5 star rating!! Couldn't recommend this app more. Great developer who was quick to answer any questions I had setting it up.
