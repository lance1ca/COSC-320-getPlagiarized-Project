I LOVE that each monster is a unique character and really wish more in the subgenre did this. Has a lot of loose ends plot-wise I'd like to see resolved and a few types of monsters dont join you (Pancho, Will O Wisp, ""man"", and bird) could really use a sequel or update! I'd pay more money! >_<",5,1,1.1.0g,2021-01-16 13:40:10,,
