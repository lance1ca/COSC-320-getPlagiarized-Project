Very laggy on lowest graphics and I tend to fall through the ground. First few minutes run good but it just gets worse and worse.,3,4,1,2020-07-25 11:34:39,,

She tries to eat right as I do, pushes the food away and gets my character stuck in the eating animation. Prey dissapers while you chase it",3,11,1,2020-07-24 22:51:46,,
