Controls are a bit close, resulting in a restart rather than an undo multiple times, but that was a relatively minor nuisance that was greatly overlooked by the ability to play this game again. Glad to see it on android. My only real complaint is that there aren't more levels.",5,0,2.0.8,2021-02-06 17:16:40,,

I like it cause I must think and process where I am going and shortest movement without getting trapped ...

The drag option is a bad idea to boot. I'm using a Samsung galaxy duo s. The game itself is ingenious,  exactly like the original one. You should get rid of the empty spaces on each level, thereby freeing space for larger controls. And for crying out loud, place the restart button far, far, far away from the undo button.

When i move the bulldozer it leaves trails of parts of the bulldozer on the screen and lags between screens and when i push an arrow it doesnt move right away causing me to push too many times and lose.
