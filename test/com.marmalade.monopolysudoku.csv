In addition, you can't play any games at all for 24 hours once a week as they are ""calculating results"" for the new season. I think they should at least have the option for non-leaderboard games during that time. Unfair that you can't play the game when you paid for it.

Dice don't populate for the board when you leave up. Points for completed puzzles don't actually get added up like they are supposed to. They just vanish. Puzzles disappear and only leaves you two options to play. Should not have released this yet with this many problems. Not worth the four dollars I paid to have it.

There is virtually nothing in it related to monopoly. Once a day you roll dice and move on a monopoly board and get a tiny bonus of chips. That's it.
