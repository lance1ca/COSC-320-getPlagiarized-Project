One of the largest obstacles for students who don't do well in math is that they have learned it as a set of rules and procedures that they just memorize without any justification. That is exactly what Dragonbox Algebra 5+ teaches. It doesn't give any context or meaning to the equations, it just treats the equations as abstract objects. Therefore, there is no *reason* for the rules, they are just rules to be memorized. In addition, contrary to how math is actually done, in this game there is generally only one way to solve a given equation. For example, I was given x+a/b=c. Whereas the one-step procedure for this is to subtract a/b from both sides, this app doesn't allow subtracting fractions, so you have to first multiply everything by a, then subtract b, and then divide everything by a. Absurd. I love Dragonbox Numbers and Big Numbers and Elements because they emphasize meaning and creativity and flexibility.

I'd buy stock. You are secretly learning algebra without realizing it's educational.. Just do it. Skip the trial since you'll have to repeat the levels when you buy the real one...and you WILL buy it. It's just that good. Bought it to brush up before my kindergartener gets to algebra, and not only is it reteaching me, it's teaching him too, and it's reframing a subject I've hated and made me become an algebra game addict. Kids week learn to love algebra way before school gets to make him hate it. My only COMPLAINT is that the opposite/night cards don't look opposite enough.  They should be more obviously the same thing, just negative.  As it is, it took awhile for us to always see the correct opposite card.  But the whole series is fab.

He worked his way through it almost compulsively. I think the dragons emerging from eggs is truly something that appeals to this sort of age range (or at least my son). By the end he managed to do an equation that I couldn´t do. And I have a phd in cognitive science? (although haven´t really done any equation solving for years before playing with this).  The game itself is brilliantly designed. A classic in introducing complex concepts in simple visual ways.  I think that properly this would be better for a slightly older child as it would be good for them to have some school experience to place what they have been learning in context. That said there is enough fun here to just let them fly at it.  Well done dragon box. Just considering now when to have a go with elements.,5,0,1.2.2,2016-01-05 02:34:40,,

Yes, it teaches algebra, and yes, in a kind of a semi-fun way (read: still no competition for your average mind-numbing jump+duck game). But the thing is that the actual algebra that it teaches is a *very* thin mask over the real thing.  In other words, playing with this is not much different from playing with the real thing, and I don't think that the visual fluffiness helps much in teaching.  (Before anyone takes that as nonsense, consider a comparison of the game with a touch-based interface for plain algebra, not with the pencil+paper thing you do at school.) In addition to this, I've only done the first two chapters myself, and already seen two educational bugs: when the minus sign is introduced as an alternative to reverse colors, and when a 0 is introduced instead of the green swirl icon.  In both of these cases, the change is done with no explanation, so it requires an adult's help.  My guess is that if you're expecting the game to work miracles for your kid/s without you working too, then get ready to be disappointed.",3,1,1.1.6,2013-10-06 09:11:42,"Hello Eli, thanks for the feedback!

He seems to get better over time, so he is picking something up. And, he enjoys it.  Dragonbox uses the cancellation of matching shapes to teach concepts of algebra. Basically, it is matching with a few extra operations. 1. Inverse: each image has an opposite (light/dark for images, a/-a for symbols). As you advance, you can switch a symbol to its inverse. 2. Cancellation by addition: you can put an inverse on top of top of the normal image to 'zero' them (initially taught as a disappearing symbol). 3. Cancellation by multiplication (division): put a symbol underneath a match, then drag on top to create a unity symbol (1). These three operations are combined in more and more complicated orders to simplify each level and isolate the free variable (a box, then later 'x').",5,1,1.1.1,2012-12-09 10:12:48,,

The game should have more info when moving to new ideas (letters are introduced, and the 'box' is exchanged for the letter 'x') so kids can see the correlation with what they previously learned.
