Best game on android but it takes long time to win. I played 50 hours and can't win even 10% of map. is it normal or just me too slow to win ? the growth of population is too slow.

Although the game does deserve criticism on PC due to it competing with the likes of EU4 and HOI4 there, here any complaints about it being 'not a true grand strategy game' are completely unwarranted. The game was made by a single Polish indie dev, for a mobile device that cannot possibly play a PC-level GSG. The game has outperformed anything I could've imagined, and seeing how there are updates virtually everyday, fixing bugs and adding new updates, shows how much the dev cares about his community. All I hope for is that he can add some sort of way to installing mods without rooting your device.",5,1,1.01415_ELA,2018-12-09 20:27:26,,

Scrolling through the map is slow due to lag and crashes whenever I touch the UI sometimes. I'm using an LG style 2+, I'm sure my phone meets the requirements. Its a shame that I can't really enjoy the game due to it crashing and lagging so much, I hope you fix this. Cheers!",4,1,2.0,2018-12-04 19:49:48,,
