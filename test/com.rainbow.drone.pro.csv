Nice to be able to automate flights. Only issue I had so far is that I could not find a way to cancel return to home as I want to do my own landing. I ended up fighting with the controls to land.,4,10,3.9,2020-09-08 10:15:44,,

I discovered the pro version only after the free version cut my usage down. I did not like being hoodwinked into a back door buy. The biggest complaint is the information provided is not enough. I am excited for it to be fully working MM support. The one request I would have is to add a website like litchi does so we can edit off of the phone. My phone is to small and my fingers are to fat. Adding the website will make this an App that I will keep once everything is working. If that does not happen then I will trade this app for litchi once they get it working correctly.,4,14,3.7,2020-08-12 14:39:30,,
