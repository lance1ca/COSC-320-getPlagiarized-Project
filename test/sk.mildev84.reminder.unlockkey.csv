Which is great, aside from the snooze being a bit glitchy. I changed a setting on my phone and it now works most of the time (not completely reliable, so that's not ideal). I've added the app to the list that isn't energy saved. So far so good. There are some tones which if you've downloaded them don't have permissions to be used with this app. I got some via Zedge and none work. Bit of a shame as they worked with my last alarm app. The free version is in my opinion completely pointless as you can't change the alarm duration and so it's a one sound alarm, which is the same as my phones calendar. I'll see how this goes. The developer responds quickly and tries to help.",4,4,7.0,2019-09-27 06:19:44,,
