I only play games for a few minutes, and I like ending feeling like I finished up a level or got to a ""stopping"" point. With this game, you don't get that. It's just the same very long start-from-scratch game. Every. Single. Time. -HORRIBLE AI. Seriously. When you assign minions to new tasks by sliding them around (admittedly a very cool mechanic), the AI will often select a minion that is FARTHEST away. Also, they will often choose a very backwards route to get to their task, then finally arrive with the same material as another minion has already delivered and is no longer needed. Very frustrating. This is particularly troublesome in the later levels, when minions will often come out of the most critical defense stations to do a task you need alllllllll the other way on the other side of the board. Even after making efforts to create alternate pathways, it NEVER chooses anything close to the optimal. Ridiculous.

Also, sometime the pinch to zoom functionality stops working, and a couple times my game fast forwarded without any control and I would lose an entire game due to it.  Fun when it works but quite unreliable for a $4 title - beware!
