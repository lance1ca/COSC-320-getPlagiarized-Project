After playing for longer n lil fixes made to visuals etc, the game is only missing gameplay improvements. Encounters would be better if you didn't have to be fast travelling on the world map. Torp firing could do with a lil calculation to hit a ship, other sims have this, objectives would be great, recon a convoy undetected for Xhrs, deliver supplies or Spies undetected, radio alerts etc, air patrols hunting you would be good too.
