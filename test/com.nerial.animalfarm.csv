You make decisions season by season that run parallel to the issues facing the animals in the novel. Good art decent voice overs and overall just okay really basic. Pilgrims better and offered more interesting choices,3,4,1.0,2020-12-21 02:49:24,,

In terms of gameplay it reminds me a lot of 80 Days. I'm not sure how enjoyable it would be without having read the book but maybe it will encourage people to read it. The narration by Abubakur Salim is stunning. Would have been nice to have voices for all dialogue but that's a minor niggle,5,8,1.0,2020-12-18 10:48:48,,
