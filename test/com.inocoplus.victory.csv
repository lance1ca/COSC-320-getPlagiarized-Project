You get the picture. Little variety in enemy units. I was expecting base

both parts. You will complete the game before exploring what the developers 
apparently intended. Given the fact that you will be busting rocks and 
constructing unnecessary rooms only to realize the only way to do so would 
be to play the same levels over and over with no need to update your 
strategy. If anything, I would recommend a weather system to increase 
difficulty for multiple playthroughs. Having to jump back and forth from

becomes quite repetitive. Gameplay is good but fun factor takes a huge dive

Играл на ПК, куплю и тут, дабы поддержать разработчиков! Всем любителям стратегий рекомендую. Графика вполне неплоха, сюжет присутствует, тактика вполне интересна, порог вхождения низкий, но позднее выявляются тонкости. АИ немного глуповат, больше давит массой, но не раздражает. Авторам успехов - ждём ещё игр! P.S. В обучающей подсказке стоит поменять ""нажмите левую кнопку мыши"" на что-нибудь более телефонное)",5,160,1.0.38,2017-09-07 22:13:59,Спасибо!,2017-09-07 18:09:20
