I love any space exploration game and this one checks all the boxes. I can trade, do missions to raise reputation, trade, pirate, or just shoot off an explore. Combat is a bit frustrating but the customization available for the different ships and tons of different equipment is great. I love that it is so open so you can choose your own play style.

I'd like to see the developer add in a semi-idle scripted mining mode where the ship will mine and fly back to a station, selling the products. I feel that in a year or so the economy in this could be much larger, and as a single player game, automating certain grinding tasks such as mining wouldn't be a negative.",4,1,11.0.7,2021-01-18 18:28:44,,
