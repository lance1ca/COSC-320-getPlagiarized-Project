Very Fun. But I have a few critiques. Since it seems like you guys are still actively updating this game once again, I believe you should add some stuff to tower defense. There is so much you can do with that genre than what is actually available. I think that you guys should definitely add different effects that towers can do to enemies. Such as slowness, freezing them, explosion damage, and even the ability for the projectile to hit multiple units on the screen. This would add so much game play ability for the creators and it would definitely help make tower defense the genre that it should and could definitely be. You should also allow us creators to send multiple types of units in one entrance. Placing multiple entrances to add a multitude of enemies can get extremely frustrating and is very time consuming because we have to scroll through so many waves. You should also take off health, damage, cost, and even the money caps on entrances. This will make gameplay so much more advances and unique allowing the creators to come up with their specific values they need for their games. If they want to have a boss that has a million health and a tower that does a million damage, let them do it. I can see this drawing so many more people to the tower defense subject and making some insanely amazing games. Keep it up guys. You have an amazing app here and it runs really smooth for being on a phone. You guys are a great company and this app is so unique. Keep on updating it to be the best that it can be and I promise you it will blow up at some point. It is so fun.",4,26,1.0.62,2020-04-07 10:27:51,,

But after getting to install this on nearly every device I had up to this moment ever since I bought this app I can say that the app seems to not work with other devices sometimes, even seemingly modern ones, so my advice to those who want to buy it (I recommend it!) is to test the game asap or try the demo first. For example about certain devices not working, in my case I used to have an old tablet (a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3V) with Kitkat that can run this, but a newer tablet (Huwawei Mediapad 3T) with Lollipop and better specs overall makes the game crash on startup, then as of this writing my new phone (Samsung Galaxy J7 Core) can run the game again. The devs might want to look into these crashes occuring with other devices like what other reviews have mentioned here too... EDIT: After playing around a bit I think I seem to experience the sprites disappearing in menus like the other reviews have mentioned too. It fixes itself if I restart the app but this is a temporary fix and it isn't normal. Please fix this... it's hard to do stuff with sprites now...",4,6,1.0.41,2018-10-11 16:19:28,,

You guys should add descriptions. You can tell the story, update log, and comments by critics onto there! Add cycles for bosses too. So you could make attack 1, set the speed and value of attack, then attack 2, 3, 4, and 5. And you should also make patterns too. So each pattern would change after each cycle and 1 cycle is one pattern. Another idea is for the falling platforms. These platforms has an option to cause damage upon falling on you and another option to make it possible for enemies to step on it and fall too. You can also make falling platforms to apply with cycles and patterns. Falling platforms can also move and follow the player. You can also add speed for the falling platform when moving, and the speed when it falls down. And make bullets or projectiles an option to follow enemies/players. Looping for projectiles would also be nice, and a timing for them too. So when you want it to explode, you can add a time. Ricochet for projectiles would also be nice too.

It's also feature rich, each genre has a significant amount options available so that you can make the game how you want it, without little limitation. Overall, I won't even think about looking for other game maker apps on Android. My only problems are these:  -The music composer feature could use some more detail, like the ability to adjust the volume of notes. Some instruments blare too loud and over shadow others. Also, maybe add a few more octaves (lower octaves) to give more depth to the music.  -When editing levels, the top menu takes up 10% of the screen, making it unavailable to place objects, so things like health and lives have to go lower on the screen.   But aside from those things, this is a great app, ESPECIALLY for it's price. It's more than worth the cost. LOVE IT!",5,1,1.0.30,2015-06-26 09:56:41,,

But I have an idea for this game. I love the new games you can now make! And hopefully this will keep happening. A fighting game should make a good idea (for example: mortal kombat). And I have a thing that could help people out (and me). So you know the gameplay sounds I think they would be in categories like if there's sounds that would be a coin sound. It could go in the pick up sounds. OK just to let you know I love your game so much and I hope you keep on improving this game a lot! But this game my favorite game by far!
