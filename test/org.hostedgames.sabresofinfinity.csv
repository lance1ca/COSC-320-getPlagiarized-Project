As a relatively sparse source of media, interactive fiction distinguishes itself from visual novels and other methods due to the dependence of good exposition and description.  In the case of Sabres of Infinity, it uses this dependence as its strength. Places in the game are notably detailed, characters are fleshed out and the plot takes many turns. In the opening chapter, this is done to a tee, where you see the observations of characters, and then decide whether duty really is more important. The conflict of choices is relevant, and though there are optimal playthroughs, the failures are accented and interesting. Each of the story arcs have high and low points, but due to the replay potential of the game, one learns more about details that are left out from prior playthroughs.  My few gripes about the game are the occasional syntax error and the ""roguelike"" playthrough system, but the system does place more value into your decisions. In addition, it is hard to determine what choices depend on your attributes. Otherwise, Sabres of Infinity is a solid read.",4,5,1.0.0,2013-06-25 12:33:26,,
