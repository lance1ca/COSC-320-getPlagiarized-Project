The other issue is just (comparatively) bad UI design. Some menus and stuff feel awkwardly tucked away. But it's pretty acceptable! However the sound quality is truly amazing compared to any app I've tried on the market. There is so much more depth to the sound. Obviously the better the sound system the better the experience.

It makes it easy to simply use an app to hear rain sounds without needing to worry about a storm coming in. It's easily worth the low price and I LOVE that it works ON TOP of the music I'm playing. One other thing that I love is that even if I stop my music, the rain keeps going. I only have one gripe and two suggestions. My gripe is that sometimes the rain sound will stop after 20 minutes or an hour, while other times, it'll play all night. Even when I don't have the sleep timer on, it'll still randomly stop. I've gone through my settings and allowed background apps to continue running, so I'm not sure why it stops. One suggestion is to add a panel for rain against a window pane. My other suggestion is a volume slider. When I play music with the rain, sometimes the music will nearly drown out the rain sounds and I'll barely hear the rain app. Since the rain volume turns down with my music, there's no way to avoid this.

I've been looking for a good rain/mood music application for a long time on Android and I think I've finally found it.  The sound quality is unmatched by the multitudes of others applications I've tried and the interface is simple and clean. It has no problems with looping or anything of that sort even on the latest builds of Android 4.x ICS and it's very stable and smooth.  This is basically what I've been waiting for in a rain app since I left iOS 1-2 years ago. 5 stars. I have a few points of feedback though.  - It'd be great if we could select the rain type to play continuously if we like one. I'm partial to 'rain on a tin roof', but Rainy Mood just cycles. - I'm sure some people will want to be able to adjust the sleep timer past 1 hr. - This is petty, but I do feel like the icons in the main 'control box' could look a little cleaner and nicer, but that's just personal preference.  Thanks for the great app guys!",5,1,1.0,2012-11-14 00:54:33,,
