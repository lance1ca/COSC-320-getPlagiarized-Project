A lot of really good features I was trying to figure out how to do on a spreadsheet and in an interface easy to use.

The X3 bar itself is an awesome workout tool, the ""X3 tracker"" however, is not. So I am very pleased that I purchased this seemingly expensive app. But it seems that it is worth the money.
