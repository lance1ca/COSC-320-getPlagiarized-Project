They are detailed and highlight what kind of intention and main techniques will be used. I look forward to practicing with new recordings for the Advanced I AM Yoga Nidra Certification Training. When will the sixth nidra and more be added? It would be great to add more to the rotation.,5,3,1.2.1,2021-02-05 21:43:40,,
