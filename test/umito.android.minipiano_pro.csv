Keys lag so much or don't make a sound - worthless app. Single mom here trying to be creative in finding solutions to the budget cuts that stripped our schools of music education.  Thanks.,1,2,2.3.2,2013-10-11 12:21:44,"hi, sorry to hear that. if you want a refund please contact. note that there is a free version you could have tested. most devices work without problems.",2013-10-11 14:04:53

Users, please plug your devices into an amp or stereo system. Then and only then (provided your headset sucks) you'll understand why THIS is the best synthesis app you'll find on Android! Give kudos and props to the developer instead as I don't believe this was meant as a replacement for your high end keyboards. A talent show maybe. Don't be so frigging serious! Enjoy life! Enjoy this app like I do. Thanks so much for this!",5,3,1.8,2012-01-09 11:39:36,,

None of the selections sound correct. This keyboard sounds like one of those El cheapo keyboards from 20 years ago with 88 voices that sound all the same. That was acceptable 20 years ago, but digital technology makes that inexcusable in the 21st century. If you are looking for quality sound, keep looking.
