There were just quite a few intentional bad decisions that made this game less fun than it could have been, which I feel is almost worse than laziness/bugginess.

This is probably the best game about a fighter I've ever played. All the mechanics make sense in the world that's presented. I have I think 3 hours played so far. Just bought it and haven't stopped. However, the game is not well optimized. My screen is not active when playing so my phone automatically starts dimming. The load times of each area is slow. The worst is when your stuck in an animation and the game doesn't let you exit it while time ticks away. S6 edge+",3,7,1.0,2016-01-29 01:40:12,,
