So you know how there's usually about one minute of every song that you really like?  Yah, that's what this app is trying to do, pick the 60 seconds from any song and then crossfade to the next song, attempting to make some smooth transition for tempo and timbre.    It's not great.  I didn't always care for the part of the song that it picked.  A few times I was just kind of getting into the song and they went to something else.  Here's the other thing - I have a very diverse music library with tons of different styles - this thing doesn't care about that one iota.  It goes from rap/R&B to adult contemporary to country (AND Western) without apology.  It's really jarring.
