And the camera angle makes it difficult to get a decent view of your surroundings. I started with the tutorial, and I failed at every single task, even though I performed them correctly (I watched YouTube videos to confirm this.) Having to hold ""Up"" just to go forward is annoying, and the controls are very inconsistent, to the point where it's difficult to figure out which combinations do what. This was played with a gamepad. I don't understand how a dev can have such unintuitive controls on the 3rd iteration of a game, when THPS has a near-perfect framework to borrow from.",2,30,1.0.7,2017-12-25 21:50:54,"Hi, thanks for your feedback. We're working on improving the controls. Do you feel that the tutorial does a poor job of explaining how the controls work or that the steering is sluggish/laggy/poor? Please let us know what you think.
