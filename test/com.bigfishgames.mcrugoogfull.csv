The super puzzles were great.  However, there was something hinky in the super puzzle in the bonus game.  There was a slider puzzle that needed 3 components.  But, once you got those parts, the puzzle simply closed, so you could not solve that part.  Sorta disappointing.",4,7,1.0.1,2016-07-18 11:20:33,,
