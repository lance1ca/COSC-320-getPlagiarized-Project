There is also hardly any backstory, you barely know about your character apart from he was in a war and his granny was a healer.  My choices did appear to be more impactful than in TGT though and changed the story considerably. It also annoyed me that after I told Finch I wasn't interested, the exact same sequence happened again making me reject him again.

And that's not even pointing out the fact that it's technically five adventures with one long overarching one that gives it extra longevity.

They're so well-written, and gosh the writing is just so good because even in my first playthrough I felt like I had really known them all for years by the end of it.

This is how a great story should be, to be able to churn up emotions & to be able to make you pay for those moral choices.  If you ever wanted a lot of time to spend on reading a great decent story book that you wish you can write the story, this is one of them.  10/10 will read it again.",5,4,1.0.0,2015-11-24 21:24:11,,

The romance is deep and makes you feel for it. The best is how the story has so many options that it's unlikely you will get the same ending over and over again like the others,5,2,1.0.0,2015-11-24 21:02:50,,
