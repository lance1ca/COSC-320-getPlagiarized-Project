However there are 2 big problems that keep me from enjoying it. First it can be hard to see the colors coming up until they are right in you, and some of the ""setting"" color rings are a different color than the activating rings. Second, the 360 move really doesn't work. You'd have to lift your finger off the screen twice and move it to the other side. You can't do that and hit the lines in time.",4,10,0.1.60,2021-01-09 19:41:06,,
