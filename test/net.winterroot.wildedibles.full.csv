First, despite what the App description claims, it actually places the images on the internal phone memory, NOT on the microSD card.  (I experienced this with 2 different brand phones.)  If you can't spare tying up 2.38 GB of your phone's internal memory for the images, I would strongly hesitate purchasing this App as it currently is.  Second, downloading is a total pain with this App (buggy).  Expect to clear the image folders and re-attempt image downloading several times before it will successfully get all the images loaded.
