This means you have to duplicate your databases into .pgn and subsequently keep both up to date.  I cannot find how to search by position on my saved databases therefore I assume its not available either.  The playback board is clumsily designed making playing through games awkward as the buttons are often mis-hit.  I will persevere in the hope that these niggles are ironed out but if I was wiser I would have spent my ¬£3.49 on a pint of Guinness & experimented with the free apps available.  Edit - Wow!!  The March update is a game changer.  I'm increasing my rating to 4 stars due to the increased ease of using it as a database.  Saving games & positions has improved drastically.  Now worth the money.  Some quibbles remain eg not .cbh compatible & some other improvements can be made but am now confident Chessbase will get to these.  Well done!!,4,7,2.0,2012-03-10 13:49:20,,

In addition to coming with a set of games in a pgn file, it offers access to online games on their web site as well.  This morning as I started on the chess puzzle in the paper, I noticed the puzzle came from a game played last year. When I searched for it, I found the full game available on the chessbase site.  Replaying 1000's of games with full annotation is a great way to learn chess.  Chessbase was able to access another set of annotated games I'd independently downloaded.  They also offer an ""opening search"" which I puzzled over for a bit.  I finally realized that by selecting a series of moves, Chessbase looks for games that start with these moves, and you can select one from the corresponding list of games.  This was one case where a little ""help"" might have been in order - there is none - and that would be the only criticism I have.
