strangely (community already complained in their forums, no fix yet), which 
makes it basically unusable. Also, the pause functionality is not working 
on short stops, the timer pauses correctly when I stop, but just jumps back 
to the total time after continuing the ride. So in summary, this is nothing

This app is just extraordinary!  I have used many, many GPS apps for my adventures (Gaia, Offlinemaps+, etc.) and this one takes the cake for the features I require minus gimmicks and bugs.    From a user and software developer's standpoint, this app is a dream to use.  It allows hassle free importing of points, fully supporting KMZ rich data (CDATA picture link and icon support).  It also scales huge data sources very well.  I have over 10000 points on the map and it doesnt slow down one bit.  It's advanced features work seamlessly.  In fact, I found this app because I needed POI Proximity warning capability.  There really wasn't any other eligible app with enough features that had POI proximity alert, so I was thoroughly pleased on discovering that it works very accurately and was highly configurable.  The support for my previous navigation app I had used stopped listening to their customer base a while past (CDATA and Icon KMZ import support & POI Proximity Alert feature)...so I am happy that this app has everything I need right out-of-box.    The routing engines for navigation leave something to be desired; however this is understandable, for driving, I don't think anyone can beat Google with their realtime traffic data and routing - so I just use my Google maps for that.    This is already a 5+ star app, but for my usage, the following wish list / feedback would improve the app further:  - Larger selection of maps with downloadable areas (Openstreetmaps and Bing Maps) like Offlinemaps+, supports - especially satellite imaging, as worldwide satellite imaging is not available via Locus.  - Temporary access or cache of Google Maps/Terrain/Satellite, even if downloading areas is disabled due to TOS.  Great app guys, to support the above needs for my usage, I will continue to use Offlinemaps+ for satellite support, but the amazing features here have made this my primary adventure/travel nav app.",5,0,3.30.1,2018-03-19 15:58:51,,

I can see I'll get a lot of use with it.      HOWEVER, I've found two annoying flaws that keep it off of 5 stars.    1: The app lets you modify the quick utilities on the top bar (similar to pinning programs to the toolbar in windows).  Unfortunately, they don't stay there.  Opening and closing the app resets the top bar to the original tools (as well as the name of the app which seems kind of silly)    2: quick points (which is basically what I bought the app for) claims to add a point on where your map is centered but in practice it pinpoints your current location.  I had wanted to mark a few places that I remembered off hand, but the minute I titled the point, the map instantly recentered on my current location and put the point there.    I'll definitely keep using the app and keep digging into features and hopefully get those two flaws figured out!  edit:  I figured out the second thing .... it isn't described well within the app, but on their website, it tells you how to do it.

I don't begrudge the creator payment....but I do not want to pay for this. Google maps is great- this does not have it. It DOES have access to many maps- many of which one must pay for, Fair enough. But again, I can get access to the same maps (open Street Maps etc.) with other apps. I don't geo cache. Folks who do may LOVE this app. Folks who need access to a particular map, or overlay, or ability to offset, have need to use a variety of external devices, or need to convert one format to another may love this app. I have used the route editor, and found it very useful.

I had almost given up on this app too but once I downloaded the California Topo on my phone for offline use, this app became my go to app.  This was the only app, I did not have to study or use instruction but simply learned as I went along.  The clarity of the map and ease of the use is unmatched by any other apps.    With the other apps even if I purchased their maps did not really work as well.  One did not zoom in anymore than level 8, and another app I had to go to their site each time I decided to hike and I had to download individual maps... It was tons of extra wasted time and hassle.    Now, wherever I turn on my Locus Map Pro, my map is there with all the details I want.  Great job by Locus Map Pro team...kudos to you guys.  IMO, after trying about 10 different apps, this is the one worked for me.   PS:  I was over a decade of handheld Garmin GPS user.

It is also the first that I know of that will bloody navigate within the app to your off road destination, and navigate you on the trail if it is marked in the map of your choice. Perfect, right?  It won't navigate offline. I'll let that sink in. You have to download a second app (BRouter) and use its nav data. That makes absolutely no sense. Locus has the maps downloaded/cached, and clearly knows how to use the GPS signal from the phone. Why in the world can't it navigate on its own offline?  Also, the free map selection for the US is just okay. This is a Euro focused app, and that is okay so long as you understand that upfront. But there are third party websites to get OpenStreetMaps downloaded straight to Locus.

The most notable, at least to me, is the 'My Places' functionality. You can retrieve Google map locations in the same way you can in Google Maps. Unfortunately, the app doesn't seem to allow you to navigate to multiple points like I was hoping. It does however give you alerts when you get close to a waypoint or POI. You can add multiple waypoints along your route and get alerts when you get to a selected distance to them using the 'Guide' functionality. My goal was to create a route in Google Maps, import it into Locus, and have Locus provide audible directions to each destination I created. Not doable with this app.       Some nice features are the ability to add a custom toolbar on the right had side of the screen to access function you use a lot. You can also set the app to hide any of the 3 toolbars available automatically if you don't use them often, but it's hard to unhide them. Last but not least is the horrible documentation!
