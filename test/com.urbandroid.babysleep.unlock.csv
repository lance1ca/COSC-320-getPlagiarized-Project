User friendly and modern design. I rarely buy apps but this is an absolute exception. I love all the sound options. I have a question regarding customising sounds. My baby loves the sound of the car but the indicator light is too loud compared to the other background noises and it wakes him if he is sleeping light at that very moment. It would be nice if it could be customizable e.g. reducing or removing some content of the sound sample. Is it something doable in the near future?,5,50,2.0,2020-02-27 03:13:00,,

Of course, all babies are different - but I write this while it is running in the background after a successful snoozing thanks to the train noise. Thanks guys.",5,3,1.2,2015-03-14 22:43:36,,
