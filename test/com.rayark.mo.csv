Interesting story. I did have a problem with the game not recognizing that I had a controller connected though. So I hope that issue gets fixed soon because I was really wanting to play this with a controller. I know it was an issue with this game too because I was able to use my controller with other games but as soon as I tried it with this game several seconds later just didn't work at all, even though it still showed that my controller was still connected to my phone.",3,1,,2021-01-21 00:52:02,,

For instance I connected the controller and it doesn't work because the game doesn't recognize the controller is connected. And when the game actuay recognizes the controller it does not work on the game, it doesn't want to move or do anything it sucks, but anyway hope you guys can fix it I really like this game.
