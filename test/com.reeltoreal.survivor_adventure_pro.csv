The game is very buggy, while addicting, and I have not encountered any real players, just fake AI that are all named ""Player"". You can't cook the fish in this version, and sulfur is unobtainable as you only have access to 6 islands and an occasional shipwreck. There is no deconstruct option when building, and the hitboxes of enemies are extremely wonky. Bone pickaxe is no better than a stone pickaxe.
