Works as described. Had an issue in the beginning that got sorted out by the support within a day. Saved my bacon already once, when my normal remote keyfob didn't work.(driveway gate/alarm/garagedoor). Would like to see the option of having the inputs displayed numerically, instead of alphabetically though.",4,0,1.0.9,2014-06-01 04:12:05,"Hi, Thanks for you feedback. We are working on improving the app and will add the option to display items non-alphabetically in a upcoming release soon. (had more people ask to have it alphabetically so that's why it was changed to alphabetically.)",2014-06-01 16:44:06

I tried the other apps - mykeypad & ElkDroid Security- and couldn't get them to work.   I downloaded this app and was having more connection issues. I sent a suppot email and he had me connected within the hour.   He already has done an update to fix a small issue I was having with lighting.   I wish all apps were supported this well.
