I love it. I've beaten the game a few times and it's always fun to start over and have a different playstyle, i.e. hire different types of employees to start with. But there's one thing that's been bugging me for years now, since before the mafia story line, before the sell/buy auctions, before all that.... Its been mentioned by devs multiple times, on different posts that after a while we can tell a customer's personality by just by looking at them, and that's just not true. I've done everything I can think of to try to figure it out, but its impossible!!!! I have been searching the internet trying to find some hints for this, but there aren't any, and I'm starting to think that it's all random and looks have nothing to do with it. I'm the type of person who does brain games and logic puzzles all the time and I can't figure it out.

A few things I'd suggest:  1) I'd like to see the repair/restore option be changed so that it only bumps it up one level and only takes one day (i.e. terrible to bad, bad to good, etc.).  I feel like this would allow for greater versatility in repairing items, or getting to the item you want to repair immediately faster.  2) A wild card on the repair/restore option that occasionally reduces the value of the item.  Similar to how restoring some antiques in real life can actually lower their value.  3) An option when using the expert to estimate the value of an item either estimate at the current condition, or do a restore/repair if you have a restorer available that would take the condition from any condition to a very good condition, and then do an estimate on the item.  4) General improvement in late game content/items.  I find it frustrating to play for an hour and not come across any high dollar items, therefor not making much money.  5) Retaining current store for residual income when restarting game.",4,0,1.09,2018-09-25 09:38:26,"Hi John, thank you very much for your feedback and ideas, we have very few characters to answer here, I copied them on our Public Roadmap in the Requests & Feedback card ( https://trello.com/c/lGv4asV8 ) where I answered to each adding some thoughts and questions, we can discuss them there!

rarely see and am constantly hunting for on the playstore. Going into this 
purchase blind, I have to say I'm not disappointed with my choice to. This 
game is incredible! After first opening it got absorbed in it and somehow 3 
hours passed. This game even works if you have to kill 10-15minutes. Heck, 
even less than that if need be. Easy to pick up and put down in minutes or 
to play for hours. I can see this as a game I'd buy on the Nintendo Switch 
with an increased pool of items, variations of enemies/competition, maybe a 
few other long term goals aside from the one currently implemented - some 
more tweaking for longevity. Even as is though, I'd purchase again if that 
ever were to make an appearance. Solid game. Great concept, well executed! 
Funny references. Hit every mark for me personally. Since my purchase, I've 
had two other friends buy, too. Definitely recommend playing.",5,1,1.00,2018-04-15 05:05:58,"Hi Victoria, thank you for your review and for your kind words!

Items: Vintage items that are pretty damn unique, for example. ""A sword that had been created to slay dragons in the early days"" or have people bring in their whole collection into the pawn shop and you can buy them as well. Like their whole card collection, comic book collection etc. Items like really rare ""early printed money""   Features: Now this is from my own opinion, able to see your own character being created such as having a male or female, character customization. Hiring security guards, I know like those brainwashers are security guards but having an option to kick them out with ease is as well nice. A new item background history, I'd love to read them, even if they're made up. Can bring more immersion to them.

Would of gave it 5* but I just lost my save after days of playing. Phone died and when I came back to continue it does not work even clicking the continue button does not do anything or trying to upload the save to the cloud so I can uninstall and redownload I think the save may be corrupt? I also agree with a previous review that the Mafia part is a bit too much at first, there could possibly be a mechanism to determine when you move to a better shop and then it's triggered otherwise it makes the beginning too difficult. I did just find a way to bypass it with the hiring of an ""employee"" but again that's a bit difficult in the beginning. More items would also be nice and an additional dynamic to the story line. I do enjoy the haggling for price but maybe allowing trades is also a good idea just like in a real shop or even a different method of affecting the price or deal in general. The up and down on price should be adjusted a little or allow for an increase in amount it just takes too many clicks to get to a price you want.
