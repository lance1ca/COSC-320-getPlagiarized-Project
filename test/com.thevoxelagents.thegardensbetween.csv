It takes a little getting used to so the first few minutes are kinda spent figuring things out, I was watching a video about why video games still have a HUD and this one basically ditches anything like that and it's more of an immersive experience as a result. The music is excellent, as are the graphics , so you do need a good phone as it looks great with max settings. it's a fun puzzle game, give it a go",5,19,1.08,2020-08-01 05:28:16,,
