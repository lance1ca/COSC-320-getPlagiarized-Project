The battle system is one of the best, as regular battles are actually hard, you can almost never spam attack and win, but it is still fair, not frustrating. The job system is fantastic and lets you create a lot of class combinations and lots of good abilities in each job. The soundtrack is even worthy of being in a real FF game.

First of all, will *not* even start if you've got the xposed framework enabled (no Greenify for you!).  Just about everything *else* in the store is fine with it.  Second, the ""auto"" fight system is rock stupid.  The *ONLY* thing a character will *ever* do is the one single command.  Even when it makes no sense at all it will just fight and fight until it dies.  Oh, and sure hope you don't suddenly get a call or have to switch contexts because you can't count on auto-save.  You have to start the app up all over again.   It's just Squ Enix continuing to cash in on their once impressive name.  The one thing I like about it is it's *NOT* trying to be some super-duper-oh-so-cool-cutting-edge-3D game.  If you're willing to give up xposed and they cut the price down to something reasonable like $2 or $3 then *maybe*.",2,4,1.0.9,2014-01-03 03:11:39,,

Story-wise, it's what you expect from a 16b era Final Fantasy- I'm not sold on the episodic format, but I understand that it was originally launched as individual eps in Japan.  I almost took a star off because it needs you to be online to launch it (I'm fortunate enough to be able to tether my tablet to my phone, and it doesn't seem to consume much data), but you can lose network connection after it launches and until you close the app (or it is closed by the system while in the background) you don't need network connectivity.

I was disappointed at first with the 2D graphics, but they're actually quite attractive and compliment the game well. The music is fantastically scored, although there aren't many unique tracks. The game will take you over 40 hours to complete... thanks to the excessive dungeon crawling and random encounters. It seems like there's a dungeon crawl between every cut scene - and in these dungeons, you'll be in a random encounter every three seconds or so. Sometimes you'll take a step after finishing a battle and find yourself in another one. And with 5 or so unique enemies per dungeon, this game can be really repetitive at times.

The art style feels a bit weird on the newer devices, some of the sprites look really odd because they use tricks that are no longer necessary. I can overlook that though. The story is a bit weak (it's the old save the crystals story again) and it gets weaker as the game progresses because of the strange episodic nature of the game. Like FFXIII the game forces control from you and changes the characters you play as. At first it was interesting, but it just got annoying. After playing for hours to progress one group of characters I'm suddenly forced to play with a whole other party because of the way the story is set up. I think the episodic nature of the game just doesn't translate well when the whole game is put together as a whole.  Honestly, if you get to choose between this and any other Final Fantasy title on the market (aside from All the Bravest of course) pick the other title. Final Fantasy I & II have the classic sprite feel to them, while Final Fantasy III has a great console RPG feel to it. This game feels half-baked, unfinished, and just poorly planned.

Turned out to be quite disappointing.  Graphics are acceptable, but there is a noticeable lack of tile sets...  All locations look the same after a certain point.  The sprites do not have enough emotive animations.  Character sprites outside of combat do not reflect their jobs.    The story and characters are not particularly engaging.  Nothing is very well-developed.  The world is bland, as are the people living in it.  The episodic nature of the game works against it, as every chapter follows the same formulaic pattern (meet new 5th party member, go to dungeon, 5th party members leaves and you get his/her job).  The job system is fun enough, but not quite as dynamic as the one in FF V.  The music is good enough.  A major flaw is the inability to transfer one's saves to a new device.  For such a long RPG, this is rather unforgivable.    I'd recommend FF3 over this game.",2,0,1.0.4,2013-05-04 14:20:19,,

I was a little hesitant at first, given the price tag and the ""RPG-Maker"" esque graphics, but I think this game holds it's own against the true classics of the 16-bit era. I bought the game when it was on sale for 50% off, though if you can afford it I would argue the value is still there at full price.  The story is simple but doesn't feel lazy.  The dialogue is nothing to write home about, but the story moves along at a pace that keeps you wanting more.  The game's difficulty is challenging enough to keep you on your toes during boss fights, but is never frustrating.  A messed up difficulty curve could have ruined this game, so I feel they nailed this aspect.  The Job system from FFIII and FFV returns and gives room for loads of customization and flexibility.  I'm 26 hours in and am only halfway through chapter 3 (of 4), so there's plenty of game here.

Nice music and I like how you can change it to 16 bit style music!  Unlike some of their earlier ports (FF1) it works quite well on Android.  However there is some popping and stuttering of the sound on my Nexus 7.

To get around the bug, tap on use or discard, and double tap on the item. Then, it will execute. Irritating though]Saw this game, and as a huge FF fan, I spent the ¬£13.99 asking price and bought it, as my friend has it on his phone, and has no issues. Looks brilliant, and was great for 20 minutes. Then, I tried to use a potion, and a cursor is constantly flickering over the use icon, and will not allow me to press it. Therefore, I cannot use items, which makes the game redundent, as I won't be able to get far, and I only spotted this a few minutes after the refund option was gone. So I hope this is fixed soon, and hopefully I can download it on my phone still and see if it works there if I can make enough room on it. Hugely disappointed, was really looking forward to playing this. And it happens to random devices it appears, so I would seriously reconsider buying this if you have a device that hasn't had a positive review, as you could get the same issues as I am having.

The random battles are greatly sped up through the auto-battle feature (you can also adjust the battle speeds), so these are practically painless. You can also toggle the auto-battle easily in case you need to use an ability. The job system unfortunately doesn't unlock until Chapter 1, but it's very well done and they seem more balanced than they did in FFIII (I heard it's closely related to FFV, which I have not played yet). The story so far isn't as compelling and deep as say FFIV, but it's at least interesting. The graphics are delightful and the music (both the original and chiptune versions) are incredible. Overall, I've been greatly enjoying this iteration of Final Fantasy, and have found it hard to pull myself away from it. $20 may seem steep, but you definitely get a really nice JRPG from it.

FFD is a completely new story, with a skill system very closely tied to FF5. However this isn't a cheap production. Sprites are well animated, the music, while sometimes derivative of previous FF music, fits the tone and works well. The story is good in that, in a day and age where every JRPG plot makes no sense at all, this one stays very close to what a story would have been like in a 16-bit era FF game: simple, to the point, over the top, and not to be taken too seriously.  The biggest thing for me was that this ran like a dream, even on my low-end devices. If I could suggest anything it would be to incorporate hardware controls, step away from the episodic format seen in this and some recent FF spin-offs, and reconsider the pricing for mobile games even at launch when they know they can make the money, this is the biggest single purchase I've ever had to make over Google Play.
