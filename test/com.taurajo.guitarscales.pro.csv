Which I tried the free version for about 10 minutes and this is probably one of the best applications for guitar scales i have ever seen. I purchased the full version after trying free for 10 minutes. Now as beginner you will do fine with free version. If you take guitar seriously or you know the basics to the major scales and want to expand your knowledge the full version is a great tool. You can see so many scales and the structure as well one of the buttons switches showing the note to where it is on the scale like flat 3rd flat 5th and so on. So much information  that will allow you to really dig into your guitar and music theory. This app is money well spent.,5,12,1.39,2018-04-06 16:38:00,,
