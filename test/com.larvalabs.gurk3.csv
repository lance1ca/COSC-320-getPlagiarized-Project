I just can't wait until Gurk 4.  Also, I noticed a guy in the comments called: firstname lastname. He has a negative review for all the Gurk games and his only criticism is: ""I don't like this genre of game."" Not to mention the fact that he bought Gurk 2 and 3 even after his bad reviews!!

Anyone who pines for the days of SquareSoft's golden age will recognize the subtlety in Gurk 3 (and its predecessors). Two things are a testament to the skill of the designers: (1) The game's ""economy"" (earn gold, sell items, buy better items) is always in equilibrium, a good player will never be desperately poor but will also never have huge excess reserves. And, (2) The game's level of difficulty progresses very smoothly, so a decent player can play straight through, without ever having to grind out some extra levels to survive, and without ever finding the game has become too easy.
