There are a lot of subjects that are not covered and of those that were there are not enough questions. Plus I noticed some inaccurate and very basic answers. I bought this app in hopes that I would not have to kill trees to print flashcards but it was not a very useful tool. Only benefit was I could study anywhere without using my data to access the internet.,1,5,11.022.0115,2016-01-23 18:17:01,If you could please let us know what questions you have found  inaccurate information on we will fix the information.
