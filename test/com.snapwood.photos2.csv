I have been using the Picasa version for many years and loved it! After Google killed Picasa and most of the API with it, this is the only access the developers have to Google Photos. It is much less powerful than the old Picasa version (Google's fault) but I still like it better than G Photos for displaying (always filling the full screen regardless of orientation), selective album offline view, auto upload to specific album (i don't like the auto G Photos backup) and other neat features.   Update October 2017.  Still using the app. Finally got a phone with enough storage to sync my entire library. 250 albums with good filtering and search to find anything I need.  Thank you!",5,11,2.8.0,2017-10-21 10:29:00,,

Same thing for the slideshow function, it can only make a slideshow out of a single day's shots. Unless I'm wrong...am I? Additionally, it doesn't always update.  I Have to dump the cache and downloaded files in order for it to update recent additions to my google photo archive. Also, ( I just lowered the rating to 2 stars)  when I add photos to my google photos, the pfolio app on my TV doesn't update!  I try hitting the reload button, but nothing.  The only thing that works is to go into the app setting and delete files and cache.  Then when I reload the app it loads an updated google photo directory.
