I don't think it has the right idea for teaching writing though - there should be an option for it to guide you through each kanji and immediately ask you to reproduce it. Currently, if you get the stroke order wrong (which will happen EVERY time if you're a beginner and using this app to learn), it shows you the right order very quickly and then immediately moves on to another kanji, and by the time you get to try it again, you've completely forgotten how to write it. Somewhat nitpicky given how fantastic the other features of this app are, but I feel that the writing section is very ineffective because of this one reason. Absolutely would recommend for an learner of kanji. It is so good it's essential.",4,7,1.3.4,2018-10-29 05:45:47,,
