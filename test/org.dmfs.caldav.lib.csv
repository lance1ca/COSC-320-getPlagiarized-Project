This was the only viable and integrated CalDAV application i found.  Too bad native CalDAV should be provided by the OS.  Why it isn't there is beyond me.  Anyway CalDAV-Sync saved the day.  But unfortunately unlike the CalDAV implemention on iOS this is not complete.  I cannot see and hence Accept/Decline calendar Invites.  For me it is a vital functionality.  I guess beggers can't be choosers.  Anyway I would have given it 5/5 if invites were working.,4,0,0.1.4.3,2011-10-31 11:38:56,,
