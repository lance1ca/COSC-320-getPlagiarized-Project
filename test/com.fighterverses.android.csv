No, it REALLY DOESN'T have spaced repetition. It isn't true. You have to change it yourself MANUALLY each time for each verse at the end of your review, and somehow remember which verses you knew and which you messed up. Impossible. And the choices are weekly or monthly, it doesn't give you the choice to review after two or three or 10 days etc. This is what it would do automatically if it were based on spaced repetition. It doesn't allow you to input whether you knew the verse or not, so it cannot possibly use spaced repetition which bases the day of next review on an algorithm based on whether you knew the answer or not. This program does NOT take into account whether you know the answer or not. Please don't pass it for what it isn't. --- Here's the original comment - It has potential, but for me it is almost useless as it DOESN'T use spaced repetition, in which you tell the program whether you knew the answer or not. So it doesn't know which verses you struggle with and which ones you know. It should give you the verses you don't know to review and the one you know keep for later, but as it does not do this it is quite unusable as it keeps asking you the verses you know and you build up tooooo many verses to review. It NEEDS to be changed to the spaced repetition method for it to be usable. It is too bad because other than that it is a very nice program. Please change this. Especially as a paid app for memorization it seems obvious it should have spaced repetition, it is quite frustrating. Also although it allows you to make folders of verses by topic, it doesn't allow you to review those folders separately. If I want to review the weak verses in my evangelism folder before I go for an outreach, for example, I can't. I must review all the verses that I already know and don't know also in all other categories. I need a way to focus on evangelism verses only from time to time.",1,7,4.0.6,2018-09-22 15:52:58,"I'm truly sorry for misunderstanding your concern. While the app does begin with daily review, then gradually decreases the frequency to weekly, monthly, and 6-month reviews, you are absolutely correct that it doesn't adjust the schedule based on quiz performance.
