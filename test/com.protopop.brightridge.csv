introduced slowly. So many RPGs lay on tons of information in seconds and 
make you wanna skip the whole story altogether. This has a way more relaxed 
feel to it. Very impressive for one person to create. I really hope you 
keep working on it and adding to it. I do have a few suggestions that I 
think are realistic. I'd love to have a pause button on cutscenes since I 
missed a few getting distracted with things. And also to have the bow and 
other (melee?)weapon have their own separate spaces on the screen since the 
bow feels more natural to aim with on the left and the melee feels more 
natural on the right. Also the opening screen seems very blurry and low 
rez. I was instantly worried the game would be too but it wasnt. So maybe 
make the opening screen automatically higher resolution. I would love to 
see you gain the skills to make an mmo of some type because most mmos lack 
this quality and storylines are just a jumble of word vomit compared to 
this. Thanks so much and keep up the great work!",5,1,7.9,2018-07-26 00:19:56,"Great feedback and very helpful - thanks Diamond. For the bow button, you can drag the buttons anywhere on the screen.

the game is amazing, the graphic is ridiculous, i feel very immersed when 
playing, the world is very beautiful, the story is nice, and this game for 
me is the very definition of open world believe me i played quite a lot of 
open world game, i haven't seen anything like it, the map is very huge and 
it would take many hours to explore every inch of it, i never see anything 
like it, but the story feels very short, and the game feels very lonely, i 
know it's not and online game, but for me the lack of npc, animals/monsters 
and interaction with the npc is what make me feel the world is very empty 
especialy when the world is very big in this game, i think that's the only 
flaw, oh yeah the control is kinda anoying sometimes because the button 
keep moving around, but it's still very amazing game, i always dream of 
playing a ""true"" open world game since was a kid and this is the closest 
game to my dream, i hope you can make an online game with the same open 
world concept in the future or another rpg, i would really love to try 
them, you got a great potential, still can' believe it's a solo project,

I enjoyed exploring this magical world. Hope there will be more chapters to come. You are obviously talented so keep up the good work. A couple things to consider: the scale of the grass is odd. It is taller than the characters so it obstructs the great visuals. Maybe cut that in half. I want to see the scenery you created, not the grass. The other thing was the flight control of the dragon.

The graphics are beautiful, the game runs smoothly without overheating my device (a feat many games with far less impressive graphics fail to manage), and the story is both engaging and moving. The music is gorgeous and fitting as well. My biggest hope is that the promised full gamepad support will be released soon - the optional support that exists so far works well, but only allows moving the characters, camera, and jumping (no attacking). I also noticed that using a controller (I use the Shield 2017) to navigate the menu moves the character around at the same time, which isn't ideal. The camera angle does occasionally become awkward in an unfixable way, but those moments are brief. The text could also use a solid proofreader to correct errors (especially ""it's"" vs ""its,"" ""to"" vs ""too,"" etc). But all that said, this game is absolutely amazing.

They just die... The bow shooting is terrible the screen keeps moving everytime you shoot by itself, which is troublesome.
