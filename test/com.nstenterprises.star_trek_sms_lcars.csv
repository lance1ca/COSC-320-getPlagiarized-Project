The ""swipe up to get the nav bar"" solution given by the developer in response is not ideal as the nav bar CAN be ""clicked through"" and overlays functional areas of the app. This aspect is needlessly fiddly and a breakage of the LCARS idiom. An edit to the apps okudagram to create the button can solve this and avoid the ""trade-off"" cited by the dev as reason for it. UPDATE 20200930:And he added it.So it gets the final star. THe update needed a cache and data wipe to work on my S20 but that's library stuff in Android he had no control over.
