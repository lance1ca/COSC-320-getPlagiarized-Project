Order ID from your receipt during registration or because you refunded the App and tried to continue using the App without paying. When you try logging in you will see a message telling you which of these things to correct. You can also contact me for help as requested by the error message.,2020-12-10 11:10:40

You can email John the app creator at any time and he will respond to your concerns promptly. He was able to resolve my issue regarding my login. He's also a truck driver so give him few stars for making an app for us drivers that can come handy at times.,5,2,7,2020-10-22 15:34:13,"Thanks for your kind review and mostly for giving me the opportunity to solve your concerns.
