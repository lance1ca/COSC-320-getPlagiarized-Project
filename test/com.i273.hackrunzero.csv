The story kept me engaged, and I really enjoyed puzzle solving with cmd prompts. My only two issues with the game were that 1) I couldn't turn the vibration off my phone. It's cool for suspenseful parts, but not when playing out in public places. The settings tab also wasn't accessible. Issue 2) is that some of the prompts weren't given ahead of time. 'get', 'move', etc, so I had no clue what to do other than use the answer key to move ahead. Fun game otherwise‚ÄîWaiting for Part 3!",4,72,1.0,2016-06-10 18:25:44,,

Lombardo,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhCYpsS2CycCkmBGCdX5BCXjSkvBCvgeS6NVzS6kA,"**SPOILER ALERT** I used the answer cmd so many times because I can't guess things that are simply not known and have to be guessed. Eg. 'core' and 'deac' -no unix system I've used does deac deactivate things, which is fine if you don't have to guess it - kinda silly way to make things abstruse. Systems come with instructions, man. Why are the full set of runtime commands hidden (from the head of IT)? Ohhh, because you couldn't think of any more ways to make the game harder, and expanding on terminal commands was too much work. The other Hack Run was a bit repetitive, with the constant passwd hunt...but it was more natural to play. This version is irrational.",3,25,1.0,2014-09-10 03:19:22,,
