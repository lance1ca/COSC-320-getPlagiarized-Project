Good though it is, it's length let's it down & I'm uncertain whether the virtually blank screens between most chapters, except 2 & 3 are supposed to be so. Are there cut-scenes between all levels & they aren't loading? I'm unsure. Ultimately it's a brief pleasure.",4,0,,2021-02-02 17:43:56,,

This isn't the typical Artifex Mundi game, so if that's what you're looking for, I'd suggest looking at the gameplay video on YouTube prior to purchasing. Graphics are good, the story is cute and the puzzles aren't particularly challenging. I only gave 4* because the game is really, really short which was very disappointing, and no bonus chapter, especially for the money. I think for £4, I would have expected double the game play and a bonus level to make it good value!",4,27,1.0,2019-05-03 08:57:56,,

Don't be mistaken into thinking it's a kid's game because it is very deceptive with the sweet graphics but the detail into making you think in ways to stretch your noggin is great. A large part is observational but hidden items lead onto hidden items that you must find to solve a puzzle as a whole and some are harder than others. There is no let up either and you have to solve things to carry on with the story and clues such as they are , are very skimpy.
