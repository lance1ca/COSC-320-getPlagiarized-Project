This game has been my go-to game during the lock down times. Very fun and put together like all games should be. I gave the graphics a 3 because when you are mining the astroids the graphics goes glitchy from the amount of resources collected and the display of the amount in text. It's all a bit too much for the graphics chip. I have the OnePlus 7 Pro with 8 gigs of RAM and almost the newest graphics chip. Thanks for a great game!,5,6,1.03.568,2020-05-14 01:28:11,,
