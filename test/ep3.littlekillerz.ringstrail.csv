Awesome character-driven RPG, with an amazing array of encounters. Considering I bought the first two pretty much as they came out, being a 70p early-adopter was a no brainer, really! Just bought the quest/guild bundle, too. The music, atmospheric sounds and artwork are all stunning here, and the fact all three games share the same assets is a boon, especially as this means the two previous titles get a facelift. I'd love to see it on Steam or Xbox!",5,33,186.002,2021-01-28 15:37:07,Thanks for the update Mataeus!

Definitely one of the best, if not the best, RPG on the play store. However, it isn't perfect; the game is horribly unbalnced (mainly due to the random nature of events). One playthrough you can have gold and supplies thrown at you, and others you're fighting endless waves of enemies right outside of town and spending all your gold on injuries. Combat, too, is unbalanced. I'm almost certain it scales off of your level, meaning no matter how strong you get, the enemy is always stronger, dissuading custom builds and almost forcing you to use cookie-cutter tactics. This could use some work. Fix the balancing issues, and it would be a truly legendary game. I plan to get the DLC's as soon as I can afford them, and I'm looking forward to future titles (you should definitely stick with the create-your-own-hero theme). EDIT: I appreciate the human response. Not many developers do that. If I could give one piece of advice though: every battle doesn't need to be an epic struggle against boss-tier enemies. Sometimes it's nice to take on those old easy rats or wolves, especially right outside of town where it wouldn't make sense that there's an army of wyverns and trolls. And it would make it so the player doesn't feel like they're on a treadmill making no progress unless they resort to cheese ""tactics"". Save the difficult encounters for dungeons, guild requests (why is there a request to take down wolves or goblins when there's wyverns at the gates?) And wildernesses (the middle of those long stretches between distant towns). Just my suggestion; it would make battles less of a chore and would reward builds other than the cookie cutter one.",5,0,6.21,2017-09-25 20:19:18,We could of made the difficulty of each kingdom harder but since you can start in any kingdom it would have to change depending on where you start.

I ended up even buying the quest pack for 10$.  I have a few questions, or maybe suggestions, depending on how you look at it.  Like why does dispell stop the bleeding effect and heal doesn't?  Also there is almost no decent armor to be found in Vasena which is very disappointing.  A curved sword with plate armor just doesn't look or feel right to me in most cases.  I have a few more i can't think of off the top of my head just yet.

If this was a choose-your-own-adventure game easy five star. However it is not the combat aspect and gameplay ruin this game. To elaborate I played this game non-stop got my characters to a collective level of six and six party members, all party members are fully equipped all their skills that utilize individually are level 4.  I use blessed curse case I match the proper elements to the proper monster, and yet at this point Random Encounters kill my entire party with ease. Perhaps it is because every companion found is a magic user or Archer because there is no way to have any freedom with who you hire into your party you just have to hope for the best.  Gold is so scarce you have to choose between training skills or better equipment or having enough transportation for food drink and required first.  I spent the last 4 hours going from place to place trying to locate anything that can help my characters Advanced thinking maybe I just hit a dry spot or rough patch that is not the case. This difficulty by attrition approach to the game makes it almost impossible to enjoy since it already is extremely slow in the sense of its Oregon Trail ask movement which is a great concept if it were not so difficult to actually handle the encounters.  And speaking of encounters the skill system is extremely lopsided in the sense that you barely ever succeed despite having 10 of 10 of your skills which by the way also called build the train and has no chance of increasing unless you pay.  This all adds up to a grinding aspect of the game where you walk back and forth between two cities or between cities with Fighters Guild and Mage guild quests which range from two types laughably easy to Impossible. If that wasn't enough to make it almost unplayable when you actually get to town even a simple trip to the chapel can end in a dragon attack which is an instant party wife since you can't even hit the Dragon because your characters are not ready to fight a dragon. This crawling pace and just terrible system of attrition reloading restarting and basically Forced Gameplay makes me want to delete this game and move on because it is just so disappointing when it started out so promising. I will however give it one more shot and roll a fighter class to allow me to maybe enjoy the game even though it's taking away my choyce I will update and edit this if I find a redeemable and just got a terrible playthrough and it's just the way it is but I feel as though the game is disjointed at best.",2,3,6.21,2017-03-04 16:37:41,,

From developer view, I the one I hate is If you keep the save game too much, every time save and load, it takes more time. Maybe because you code auto-generated name for save game? 6. Some faces a bit odd, because different color of face and body, maybe you can change in the next version.

Thanks for taking the time to review the game. A couple things...

The repsec temple is  on a desert trail in Vasena. You can visit it anytime.

Our play testers have not reported this issue but some players have. If you don't mind could you please send us an email. I'd like to know how your party is speced and equipped.

I really considered it buy it seems the updates are really only for bugs and pay to play players. I'd have gladly paid two-four, seems very reasonable and then have the expansions cheaper then the game. No complaints though other then that, just also a bit difficult starting out and then becomes pretty easy around lvl8-10",4,0,5.37,2015-09-03 11:17:44,"Hi Luke,

The previous games were priced at $5 when they first came out. This one is priced at $1 and you get more game then Ep1 or Ep2. The bundle you want is the Quest bundle its $5 and give you access to the remaining story content. So that is $6 total for all of the story. This is on par to the other games.

Glad you like our games! The open world nature of the game means we can add an unlimited amount of content. However this will also require new funding to make this possible. There is a staggering amount of content now available for only 1 dollar. This game already has way more content then ep1 & 2 put together.

If you liked the previous chapters (Fallen Knight & Beyond the Iron Wall) you'll really like this one.

In addition to the choices listed in the description, you also get to choose your moral compass, and even your first skill (so you're not stuck with something you never wanted).    The new characters than can join your party are really interesting and fun, and you can rotate them around or even just drop them all and travel solo (but then you'll get outnumbered a lot).    There's plenty of replay value since you can try new games starting out from each kingdom, and there are often different choices presented  throughout the various jobs and encounters.    As noted, the IAP isn't needed to get through the game, but the add-on quests are fun and easily worth the low price, and the armor/weapon sets are pretty cool too.  But if you don't mind doing things the hard way, you won't need any of them any more than you would have in the previous games (that didn't have them).",5,3,5.20,2015-08-04 10:09:57,,

Love the open world approach; it's a fitting but fresh addition (conclusion?) to the series . I don't think I've even fully explored the first two, but they're gonna have to wait!",5,0,,2015-08-04 07:37:14,,
