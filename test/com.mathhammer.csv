I love the app, but I wanted to leave you some feedback. Sometime when I go to change the tags of a unit from the Manage Profiles tab, the app stutters for a moment then moves me into the ""Home"" tab. It makes the app feel unpolished and buggy. I'm not sure the reason, but I only noticed it happening after I had added several profiles(20+). Additionally, it would be nice if you could set the parameters or filter the outcome of an analysis (I.G. filter by best ROI, or best damage, ect.",4,4,1.4.82,2020-02-27 16:10:51,,
