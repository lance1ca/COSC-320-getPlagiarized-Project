Primarily that it kicks you out of the game when time runs out. Having a time limit is a good idea but it could be implemented in a far better way. When it happens to my opponent I'd much rather have the option to give them perhaps an extra minute. And if time runs out for me why can't I watch the game complete with the computer taking over.

If it didn't cost over £17 to get all expansions of the game, it wouldn't matter. 1. The animations take forever, between 5-10 seconds per go. So if you play a 110 tile game you'll spend up to nine minutes watching animations while your clock ticks down. 2. Your clock also ticks down around five seconds before you can take your turn, which eats another four minutes of your game. 3. My score goes down sometimes when I win or when it fails to register a win. 4. Games are timed except the penalty for your opponent running out of time is that the computer takes over for them. Nothing worse than someone running out of time and then still winning. The computer isn't on a timer so you can wait a few minutes for it to make a move but you have to be ready to take your turn as your timer will still tick down. 5. There is a karma system to penalise people quitting games, but it doesn't stop them not taking their turn and forcing you to have wait until the timer runs out or quitting yourself. 6. Not enough people have expansions because of cost so hard to play ranked games online with them. 7. You can't continue chatting with your opponent once the game ends and the search for a user function is broken. 8. If it's obvious you can't win, forfeiting the game loses you karma, so you're best to just stop playing and make your opponent wait until your timer ticks down, which is terribly antisocial. 9. Server frequently kicks you out, and of course your game continues to tick down.",1,58,1.9,2020-08-07 14:38:00,"Hello David,

If you are not in the app when the game ends, you can't know who won or what happened. This is a huge problem since games can some times take days so I'm rarely able to watch it closely. What is the point of this?? Sometimes the game can hang while the dragon is supposed to be moved. By this I mean if you put the dragon in a corner where it can't move, it's supposed to realize this and end the turn so the game may continue. Some times it doesn't and the game must be forfeited because it can't continue. The other problem is sometimes the game will decide different winner on different devices. I can sit with my friends in the same room and we will get different winners. There is no fun in this and it just causes confusion.",2,25,1.8,2020-04-10 14:44:28,"Hello Michael,

Cannot find friends also who own the game unless you coordinate to go online at the exact same time. Even while playing someone you cannot add them as a favorite. 2. If you play a game online with friends, only the last player gets to see the results unless you're the last tile. 3. Cannot see game history. 4. Cannot play across platform. 5. AI is VERY slow - sometimes up to 10 minutes to play a turn. ****** However the biggest issue is that about 50% of the time, the game will freeze when playing online against friends. We set the timer to 2 weeks so we can play back and forth. Then when it freezes, whoever forfeits to clear the frozen game gets punished with lower reputation so that player can no longer play public online anymore.

It is not worth trying to play another game where I have to have people let me know when it is my turn and then it fails in the end anyway.  Game looks and plays very well, the devs have done a good job of updating over the past year or so with new content and quality of life improvements. Back down to 2 stars because notifications are not working again (they also broke in December of 2017).

When the timer runs out, the game should not end abruptly (that is just bad, anticlimatic, and disappointing for both players).

now over half a year later, with only one additional expansion since 
initial release and no attempts to improve usability or graphics as

gameplay: 1) Pinch zoom is not sensitive enough; 2) Would like to be able 
to zoom out much more to get better overview of full gameboard without 
excessive scrolling; 3) Crisper 2D graphics with more prominent features 
(particularly monasteries and gardens) on tiles so they stand out better - 
perhaps an option to just use legacy 2D artwork? (couldn't care less about 
3D); 4) Meeples would also be easier to see if a bit larger; 5) On screen 
buttons and player/score banners could be a bit smaller to make more space 
available to see tiles; 6) Ability to disable ""auto zooming"" during 
gameplay; 7) Ability to speed up animations; 8) Dead tiles probably 
shouldn't be shown based on the current tile being played until that tile 
is committed, especially if remaining tiles list is disabled.",2,10,1.5,2018-06-23 21:48:05,"Hello Pete,

no intrusive ads. One of the available expansions is free--the Abbot, which

I was a frequent player on the old app. Why do both players have to be online to find each other to start a game?

Once I've got a friend in the app I should be able to initiate a game when he is offline. Fix this and it'll be great. I basically don't play it because of this.,3,0,1.4,2018-04-02 23:43:06,,

Functional is about the best I can say about this. I can't understand why anyone would decide to play with the game rotated 45 degrees, it just makes the tiles unnecessarily small and cumbersome. (Edit: I found the camera button to switch views, but still annoying it was necessary in the first place.) That combined with the over embellished tile graphics, slow zoom response and tiny drop zones for placing followers makes the game an absolute mess. Simplify the tile graphics and give a view of the game that I would actually play from and this would be a serviceable version of the game.

This version is animated which adds a new dimension. I wish there were more of the expansions added to this game. The one question I have that seems to come up is whether or not you can take over control of a farmyard by having additional farmers in the same yard.

Unfortunately all my stats and rankings were deleted too. I will agree with other users that this app is not ready for prime time. Funny that my account is deleted after my first bad review.   Pretty good version. My main problem is getting booted off and trying to reconnect with only 2 minutes left on the timer only to run out of time. I was up by like 60 pts and still lost.

Suggestions: 1) It would be helpful if you could zoom out even more in order to see all the tiles. 3) I think meeples could be a bit larger and have better contrast against the field, plus there are times when a farmer is placed right on the edge of a tile which makes it a bit hard for the opponent to realize you actually placed a farmer on the tile. My suggestion would be to place the farmers more centrally on the field and not on the edge. 3) The field button is nice but when one player has the green meeples and he occupies a field along with another person, it looks like it's only occupied by the other persons color because green stripes are almost the same color as the field.

I am a long time Carcassonne tabletop and digital player and I very much prefer the older version of of this digital game by exozet. The exozet version had a significantly deeper solo play, with many expansions available and a double base set of tiles for a monster game.  Originally I stated you could not play fields in solo mode, however the developer replied and advised that there is a field play setting so I will comment on that - For one, that setting is not accessible from the main settings menu, only from the game settings menu and it is a little tab off to the side.  Why even make field play an option?  Anyways, this version of the game looks good in pictures, but the play is way too light compared to the exozet version.  I would call this version Cartoony Carcassonne Light.  I recommend the developer drop the 3D graphics in this version and go for nice crisp looking tiles.  Get rid of all the glowing effects too.  I am reverting back to exozet Carcassonne.",2,7,1.1,2017-12-06 06:30:23,"Hello Kevin,

Thank you for your feedback.
There are plans to update Carcassonne and add multiple new content and expansions in a near future.

You should receive push notifications when it is your turn. If it is not the case, please check in the Notification settings that push notifications are authorized for Carcassonne.
The timer in online multiplayer mode can be adjusted up to 15 days, so that you could play at the rythm you want without forfeiting.
