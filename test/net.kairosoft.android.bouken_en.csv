It's a surprisingly fun game with an absolutely terrible interface. When there is a list of items you have to very carefully touch the scroll bar and drag instead of scrolling like a normal touch screen application does. The buttons are very finicky and have to be pressed just the right length of time. Sometimes when unselecting a character and pressing elsewhere on the screen, the previously selected character is chosen. It's hard to tell when any item is selected as there is inconsistent use of highlighting when a widget is touched. Tabs cannot be swiped in between, they have to very carefully be touched.  I am guessing that this is a straight port of a flash game and it demonstrates why lazy programming is so bad.

You can direct them to some extent by sending them on quests to explore dungeons and kill monster hordes but that is about it.

Though if you enjoy any kind of farming game you'll certainly like this, and likely enjoy it even if that isn't your forte! This particular title though, unlike many other Kariosoft titles which can be easily breezed through, has a rather steep difficulty curve. Money and resources can be tough at the start, and later on when they aren't you find yourself pitted against very tough monsters. Not so tough to break the game however, it adds a challenge that had me replaying just to beat. As an added note, there are no ads in the game at all.

For everyone having issues with making shops successful: - Use items on buildings to improve their stats - Appeal makes heroes visit more often - Quality, I think, raises the effectiveness of the stat boosts - Price increases how much adventurers spend each visit  *Spoiler - last classes: King, Princess, Kairobot  Overall a very well executed game with a ton content and customization, and simple interface.",5,7,1.0.0,2012-03-27 00:23:16,,

While the game seems to be a great idea, the implementation seems to be a few of each of the ideas but not strongly. Each aspect, town maintenance/building maintenance (Mega Mall Story, Epic Astro Story, Hot Springs Story etc...), character development (Pocket League Story, Game Dev Story, Epic Astro Story, etc...) and monster combat (Epic Astro Story) seem to all be done in small-ish pieces of the puzzle to make a composite game. While this seemingly should work, its ends up being so little from each that the game loses focus and excitement. I would be happier if it let me hire the heroes. If I will be arming them and such, Let me have complete control of them. If they are a wizard, I want the toon to stand back and cast not attack with a sword.
