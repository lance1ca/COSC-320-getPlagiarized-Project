I don't sit with pain well, physical or emotional. Having a hand held app to hold space to acknowledge, sit with my feelings/sensations, and not try to tell you what to do about it is validating as hell. Between the soothing visual and soft music (that you can mute if needed) it invited comfort to sit with discomfort all at once. You are simply allowed to be and feel entirely as you are. Big fan. I know this will be a game changer for my panic attacks. Thank you!!!!",5,0,1.0,2020-12-22 17:45:55,,
