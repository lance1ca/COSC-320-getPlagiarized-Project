The proverbial straw that made me return it: the descending intervals are depicted wrong on the fretboard. Justin, we expect better qualify work if it carries your name!",2,4,,2020-12-28 08:30:37,,

It's easy to use and effective. I've noticed very rapid progress in my learning new intervals as I practice with the app, and it lets you customize it to what you personally need to work on. Also, there was a bug in the early versions of the app that caused settings to not be saved on some devices, which made it not really usable. The developer was very responsive in fixing it. I wish all developers were as responsive!",5,8,1.09,2020-07-17 10:59:16,,

So far I have noticed that on the first time the app is booted up, only the 4th and 5th intervals are played regardless of what level you are on. Secondly, in training mode, intervals that are unselected get played. This means that you cannot click on the correct answer and it only appears after you get the answer wrong. Fixing these bugs would make the app 5 star",3,2,1.04,2020-06-11 08:47:13,There is a beta version (currently v1.09) that should fix these issues.  You can get it from the app page on the Google Play store today or wait for it to be released (which should be soon).,2020-06-11 09:08:17

I like the concept but the levels don't work well. So far I have passed levels 2 and 3 easily because the only intervals ever played were a 4th and a 5th making it essentially the same as level 1. The other ones (2nd, 3rd, octave, etc) show up in the training mode but the levels are useless",3,3,1.04,2020-05-10 19:12:09,We've uploaded a beta version of the app (1.06) that should fix the issue you are seeing with the levels.  You can get it from the app's page on Google Play or wait for it to be released after testing is complete.,2020-05-22 00:21:18

The piano keys you see don't correspond to the notes you hear. You might hear an A and E, but the keys shown are always C, F and G. You can press the C piano key, but (on level one, at least) it's always a wrong answer. If the piano keys aren't going to correspond to the pitches, C should at least play the root of the interval you just heard. Ideally the keys should reflect the pitches.",3,8,1.01,2020-01-08 05:39:49,We are looking into this - we might add in a third screen option that just has a list of intervals and isn't instrument specific.,2020-05-22 00:22:36
