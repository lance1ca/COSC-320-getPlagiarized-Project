Game is still great. My only complaint would be that there doesn't seem to be any way to view food stats like on PC. On PC you could hover your mouse over food and a pop-up would tell you which foods fill how much hunger, or how much they affect health. You could hover your mouse over your health, energy, and hunger meters to see their numerical value too. I couldn't find this function in this version.",5,47,1.0.18,2019-08-13 14:58:36,,
