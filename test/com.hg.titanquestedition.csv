The only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is the fact that when I minimize it and come back to play later it restart the game making me start from a save point. Mobile games are played in short increments and when you have to restart at save points it becomes tedious. I always save the game before minimizing so I don't lose items.

They are pioneers imo. TQ has the depth and replay value like the better PC games in this genre, it's a little slower in progressing but with huge content. The game has been designed to entertain players instead of finding out how to be F2P but still find ways to make people buy their microtransactions. 20 euro is what you pay, a bargain for what you get in return! Here's a list of features you might want to know: - 8 classes, some 'classics' but also unusual classes. - You'll have the option to choose a 2nd class to combine their strengths. - Loot qualities ranging from common to legendary, of course there are several set items for each class.We're talking about a loot-hack 'n slash here :) - You can craft, enchant, add enhancements, find recipes. - Access to stash and extra slots (no microtransactions, yaay! ;-) ), transfer stash. - Game + If this sounds good to you then I'd say give it a try! If you are interested but not sure, then watching some gameplay videos, checking the wiki are also helpfull to make you decide if it's worth it to you.",5,33,2.9.5,2021-02-02 19:13:24,,
