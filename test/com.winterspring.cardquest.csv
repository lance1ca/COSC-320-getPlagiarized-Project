price! As other reviews have noted, the variety in gameplay is fantastic. 
Not only is there variety with the different classes, but how you equip 
each class greatly effects gameplay. A class can play very differently with 
different equipment. Different levels and encounters reward different 
approaches. It feels like nitpicking, but balance could be a little better. 
I think there are certain builds that are clearly superior to others, 
regardless of the encounter. Some levels can feel tedious sometimes, too 
(ugh, Rotten Copse!). But do not let that dissuade you. This is a fantastic 
game, and if the concept sounds appealing to you at all, you won't regret

That said, I think it could have used some more polish on the flow of gameplay. Three of the classes have enough resources to mitigate a bad turn due to draw, but the Wizard has half the energy as the others for no discernible reason, meaning he absolutely has to draw cards in the right order to both do well offensively and properly defend. His tiny health pool makes this worse, as even normal enemies can take him out if he either doesn't draw or doesn't have the resources for a block card for every single opponent.   This also leads to a catch-22 with the unlocking system. You have to beat areas with a class to get more options for that class, but if the options you have are countered by the areas you are trying to beat then you have to replay over and over hoping for perfection or give up. It makes for a frustrating experience where the gameplay is either easy due to lucky draws or impossible due to a bad draw followed by immediate loss.",3,2,1.1,2018-04-04 06:15:59,,
