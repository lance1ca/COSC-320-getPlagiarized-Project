While I appreciate how difficult it is, it is sometimes too difficult. Only being able to send one person to scavenge, while holding weapons and such, then having to try to get supplies. It sometimes feels like there's no winning. If there was a way to use supplies to expand someone's inventory (making a wagon, extra backpack, etc), it would be great. I've played multiple rounds now where people get so depressed they can't move, so then they can't go out and they starve",4,90,1.5.7,2020-01-06 19:35:57,,

game is with it's stories and soundtrack, along with great crafting, it's 
the 15$ price tag that kills it for me, just cut it down to 7-10 bucks and 
that will be remedied, but it made made me have buyers remorse for a while 
just because it was this or XCOM for awhile and I have had way more more 
fun with XCOM. No doubt, amazing game, it's just way too pricey. At least I 
would include The Little One's DLC just so that less people feel ripped 
off. And I hope that these changes can happen because it's so nice to see 
smaller game developers make such great games (unlike a certain 2 triple A 
companies) and I hate to see a game get ripped apart by so many, as while 
they do have a valid point with the price tag everything else is so well 
made, I love the steep difficulty at the beginning, it really can help you 
realize what type of game this is but not being as gut punchingly difficult 
as XCOM in the beginning, and I like how when the story progresses we learn 
more about our survivors. It makes the game that much more enjoyable. In 
conclusion, don't buy it for the full 15$, wait for a sale or if they cut 
down the price, I guarantee you that for 5 bucks or even 7 for a sale you 
will not be disappointed if you're into these types of games, but at least 
include TLO DLC and I can understand a little bit more the 15$ price tag.",3,1,1.5.5,2018-08-06 23:00:53,,

mode with infinite days. I know that's a lot. But I also believe that we 
should be able to keep playing maybe add in more things like an actual back 
yard with trees in it for wood that you can use for resources and stuff. 
And possibly if the issue with the days is how many places we can scavenge 
then we should just be able to wait long enough for other people to 
""inhabit"" the places again or possibly a reset button on the map or 
something because I just wanna be able to play a mode where we play until 
we die. No ending it's sad because there's so much I can't even do in the

The worse one is, after I paid Karel to smuggle us out, when he comes to pick us up to leave, the game completely crashes. Happened 6 times in a row. I even tried turning off my internet and data but it didn't help. It also crashes when the war is over. What is the point of surviving if after all that it's going to crash and you never make it to the end of the war? I'm hoping the devs fix this soon because I was so excited about the new options but it's now become frustrating and anticlimactic. Still really love the game but it feels unplayable for the time being. The Karel bug wasn't the only one I struggled with, but it was the biggest. (End edit)  Recently reinstalled the game and now it won't load. It gets past the Hemingway quote then the music plays on a black screen until it crashes. Hate to give a bad review because I love this game but I'm not even able to play it. Edit: I figured it out, it's an issue with the cloud. If I take my device offline completely I can play it fine.

Well I did get it in my tablet, finished the game there and started a new one. Turns out even if it gets sync in the tablet, i cant get my progress from my tablet to my smartphone. I still keep going back to day 42, so what I did was i cleared the data and tried to sync it again and still lost all my progress and also my unlocked characters.

First of all, stop saying this is ""realistic"". One, the survival meters are better than most, but still not realistic. Two, characters being sad over their own killing, and stealing is actually unrealistic. Unless you've lived it your opinion doesn't count.  It's a good game. Looks nice. Great atmosphere. Compelling stories. Intense stealth. My first problem is with the balance. It's pretty easy if you don't help anyone who comes to the door, but drastically harder if you do. Also, choosing combat over stealth is almost always a death sentence. My huge problem is that halfway through my third run, after two complete ones, the lag during scavenging game breaking. I am unable to scavenge dangerous areas. Sometimes it's so lagged I can't move the screen back to the exits once they're out of sight. If the lag issue was fixed, I could easily forgive all else, and give it five stars. It's such a shamex and disappointment. I was really loving this game.",2,0,1.4.3,2017-08-16 13:29:31,,

Though found a bug here. I went to the Hotel which was occupied by armed thugs. There appeared to be a prisoner there who was held captive - could not free him due to no crowbar or lock pick. Long story short Pavle killed all the thugs there with a machine gun and I naturally took resources with me. When he got back to the shelter everyone was upset because Pavle stole from them.  Stealing from dead armed criminals is worse than killing them.  The controls are obviously not as good as mouse and keyboard. Though I was most annoyed by the fact that interactive buttons eg to open a door or hide in a spot overlap so when you zoom out, in order to interact, one has to zoom back in. This resulted in one of my guys getting shot. Graphics aren't too bad or good. I have an under powered xperia m4 aqua so the phone cant handle much but it does overheat and thermal throttle a lot. Wish there was a way to decrease graphical settings all the way down to the bare minimum to ensure smooth gameplay.  Edit: so I went back to the hotel with a crowbar to free what I thought was a captive. He said who are you and started running around the place screaming help. Dunno what was up with him. Usually when you free people they run out the map straight away. This guy keeps running around so to see what happened, I killed him expecting him to be a criminal who was playing hide and seek.

Here are my thoughts after beating the game: -Characters that you come to like and want to keep alive.  -Moral decisions that can lead to different endings for the characters.  -Not a fun (or particularly easy) game for the faint of heart, as it certainly has some heartwrenching moments, but worth every penny for both the OG game and the little ones DLC.  - A very long game with various degrees of difficulty (some characters are VERY difficult to work with due to lack of storage space, emotional stability or picking fights with other house members). I believe there are 12 different scenarios ranging from 30 to 50ish days with different combinations of characters.  -Definitely a lot of thought put into various senerios and how they impact your little band. Even includes crime outbreaks, changing weather, and food shortages. -Graphics are pretty good, all things considering.The last patch fixed all the bugs I'd had. Will be purchasing the PC version in the future! Great game!",5,0,1.4.0,2017-05-07 14:48:58,,

Boring gameplay, grueling difficulty and HIGH retail sticker on this game leaves me regretting my purchase.  Suggested because I like strategy games and RPGs; was told that gameplay would be similar to Fallout Shelter.  Thought game would be randomized, but gameplay is pretty linear in that you have scenarios instead of just freeplay.  Unlock scenarios as you play, but ZERO replayabilty and every scenario plays out the same way (same home building, same random rubble, same etc...).  Semi-interesting realtime mechanics, but isn't suited by tablet (in my opinion).  Building elements placed too close together and fat-fingers will accidentally cancel orders.  There is a top-down post-apocalyptic survival game in the appstore that plays very similar, but it's open-story and is FREE.  Only redeeming element of this game is that profits are spent on a good charity, so I don't really feel like I've been too heavily gypped.",3,0,1.3.9,2016-09-28 17:36:35,,

What's with that I thought it was over written???
