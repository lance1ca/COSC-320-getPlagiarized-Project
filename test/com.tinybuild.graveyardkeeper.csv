Even though i'm playing it on a pre-historic phone for me it hasn't crashed a single time like others have reported. However it does freeze up occasionally (especially when the days change) and sometimes it becomes quite laggy for a while. The biggest drawback for me has been the movement controller - the way it is done now, it is very hard to make nice, precise moves. This can be felt most when fighting enemies (dodging is a lot harder than on PC) and forget about trying to push a second log (or rock) while carrying another one. It's almost impossible.
