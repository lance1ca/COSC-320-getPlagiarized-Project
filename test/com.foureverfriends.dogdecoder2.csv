Most people dont get or are able to read a dogs body language. They have no clue there is such a thing. For example, Many think a dog barking at another dog means the dog wants to play. But depending on the body posture, it could mean more. ..aggresdion, fear. The app is a good start, but referals to indepth reading of body language would be a big help. There are books out thete on tjis subject. Good start to a serious matter. Reading our dogs. ðŸ˜ƒ",4,6,1.3.0,2019-12-16 14:24:49,,

I went there wanting to know what to do with my anxious very small dogs who become territorial when we are out with the other two. He swings on his lead and become a rottweiler! trying to get to the dog on coming. It's s got the point of not taking them out. so this app doesn't help me at all from that perspective.,3,3,,2019-08-19 05:37:34,,

The app helps me help them get started on better hearing what their dog is trying to tell them. I appreciate very much that the app is designed with such clarity.
