The concept of having to make ice cream and earning rewards (New flavors, toppings, cones) is nice. Great for your kids! I'm a literal 14 year old playing an app for kids :') but seriously, I like this. Although one thing I would criticize is that you aren't able to mix flavors like the last one. But that's okay! Other than that, I would recommend you download this for your child or yourself. üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è",5,37,20.1.61,2020-05-31 17:46:45,,
