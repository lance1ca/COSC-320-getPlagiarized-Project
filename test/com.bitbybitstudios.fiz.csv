I bought this game years ago and I still enjoy coming back and playing through it all over again. Highly worth the money, a truly fully playable game with no ads or in-app purchases, a sad rarity nowadays.   My only gripe, and it is a big one, is the customer's concern over the markup of the beer. This basically penalizes you for making a big batch - I often have batches that I can't make a profit off of because the customer won't pay the markup even though I'm pricing it far below other beers. This is a confusing mechanism that seems unnecessary. I hope they will update this at some point or MAKE A SECOND GAME (yes please!!!!) that doesn't have this severe of a restriction, making it difficult to turn a profit. Despite this one complaint, I gleefully give it five stars for the low price and the many hours of entertainment it's provided me. I find myself coming back to it at least once a year.

pretty mindless with very little gameplay. Your main goal is to make 
products that appeal to customers at various locations like stores and 
bars. You can unlock recipes that CANNOT be modified or customized which is 
the whole point of making your own beer. You can simply either afford to 
buy the ingredients for these recipes or not. You then put the right people 
on the job that best fits their stats and the beer making process begins. 
At this point you can tap mice that scurry across the floyof your brewery 
while your employees do everything automatically or you can do market 
research to see what types of beers potential customers are in to. You can 
upgrade your equipment to improve the quality and quantity of your product. 
The currency does not make a whole lot of sense from an American 
perspective. If you've ever wanted to do logistical work for a brewery, 
this is the game for you. If you ever wanted to own a brewery for the

Without them, it's an enjoyable experience.  Hard the first time you play, but maybe a little too easy once you learn the tricks needed to profit consistently. Elements of randomness make replaying possible, but things don't change enough to make it worth it, I think. The new game plus mode doesn't really change anything either, but if you like it then it's more of the same. Towards the end of the game you end up having nothing much to do but wait for the next story event, or brew more beer to add to your already massive surplus of money, which you have nothing to spend on.

Some have complained about the game being repetitive, and certainly there are parts that require repetition, but they're not extensive.  Some parts were perhaps a little slower than I would have liked--in particular, one of the endgame quests just plain didn't show up for several game years.  There are places I'd suggest some rebalancing...  but these complaints are minor compared to the game's high quality.  Oh, right: there's a story.  And not some lame ""story"" that's obviously just there to make it appear like something's happening.  No, there's an honest-to-goodness story that fits gameplay, fits the quests, and even forces you to make choices.

I've still got a lot to learn so can't comment too much but there seems to be a lot of depth.  The menus are as they should be - easy to navigate and use. One tip for the devs: if you use this format and produce a Game Dev story clone but with much more depth than GDS, I think you'd be onto a winner.

Another pet peeve of mine is on salary: it'd be nice to have a place to easily see the total salary so we can better prepare for it.  Also, the batch management system could use an overhaul. There are too many taps involved to move batches around, even after the shortcuts are added.

A minor issue, but the pause button is a little finicky as well. After you complete a batch, you have two options - Send to Market or Storage.

If you're looking  for a deep and engaging management game with that Kairosoft-esque style then this will suit you. Loving beer also helps a lot!

This just isn't how people buy things and it often leads to confusion.   * No ability to remove and keep a batch - Given how many buttons there are on the UI, you will misclick and dropping an expensive batch of beer into the wrong market at the wrong price is a costly mistake that just wouldn't happen in real business and shouldn't be possible in a game.

The characters could use a few more sprites so they actually turn the way they're moving. Also if the fires could be animated, as well as the tank the wort is added to, that would be great. The gameplay is still fun, just a suggestion. Also, maybe add the ability to create your own beer recipe? I'm not sure if that's in the game or not as I have only just started, but it could be a fun thing you unlock at the end of the game, so that you could use it in New Game+.",4,3,1.0,2013-12-12 17:03:01,,

You can play for hours or only a few minutes and you always can come back to where you were.  The gameplay is fun and easy to pick up quickly.  The old school feel of this game brings me back to my childhood gaming days of the 80s and 90s.    Plus you'll be supporting a new indie developer just getting started.  Just like supporting a local small business!  :)  Excellent game.  You won't be disappointed!,5,2,1.0,2013-12-12 05:45:05,,
