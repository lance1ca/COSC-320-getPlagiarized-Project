It allows you to enter cameras and lenses not already in the database (and you will probably have to do that. But fortunately, it's easy to do.

It had all the Oly cameras I needed, but lacked the E-M5 III, again, easy to add. To avoid wading through the camera and lens database, the program allows you to identify up to 3 cameras and 6 lenses as favorites, making switching between the favorites fast and easy. For me, the biggest negative was the web-based help screens. They oddly, I thought, gave you lots of pretty good background information, but I thought were a little skimpy on immediate instructions on why and how to use the tools.

2 people have already said this case a few months ago. The 2 versions are independent (not same version number) and the version Pro doesn't include the advertising module. There must be a bug on the Android side that launches the free version instead of the pro when both are installed.
The solution is to uninstall the free version.",2019-09-13 09:13:40

It's difficult for me to have all the devices of users up to date (digital, film, drones, ...) and many users prefer to add themselves what they need.
So I added the possibility of being able to seize the missing models yourself.

This app has all that you need to learn to use your DSLR. My phone doesn't have a ambient light sensor,  so the light meter button doesn't work with my phone. Other than that,   I love that this App teaches you through the ""Help"" button.  I would love to see this App released in an Apple version, so I could also use it on my IPad Air! (Which does have an ALS)  Thanks for the App!",5,1,1.2.0,2018-03-15 10:19:24,,
