I appreciate the work and maintaining fine quality, I can feel in every minor options which average applications do not have. One important feature is missing in this app is Loop option in the baar, you can not lock particular piece of music or baar to play it repeatedly. My suggestion to developers to add this feature which is very good and helpful in such application. Thanks.",4,6,1.11,2020-07-30 16:19:18,,

Truly worth it. It's far better than almost all apps, including things like scanscore on PC. This app makes short work of any PDF and most images you give to it. Thank you so much, this is a truly well developed and clever piece of software! However just a few suggestions - 1. Multi Bar rests are not recognised, if that could be changed, that would be amazing. 2. Triplets are not recognised which can mess up where bar lines are positioned.",4,2,1.00,2020-07-09 16:11:46,,

The app sometimes misses notes while playing and saving as midi makes the score saved skip those missed notes. You're better off using musescore and creating the score by hand rather than any sheet music scanner.",2,2,,2020-06-12 12:50:09,"Sorry to read about the issues. The app gets tested a lot with hundreds of scores and is currently used by over 100k users worldwide but it does have some technical limitations like any other optical recognition and requires a good quality photo of a decent print. Also, it supports export to MusicXML which is the format to use with MuseScore.",2020-07-08 03:55:27
