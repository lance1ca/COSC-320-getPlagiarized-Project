I have a fairly demanding requirement wanting to synch Windows computers (Outlook 2013, Mozilla Thunderbird) and Android devices (Samsung Tablet and Motorola phone) around a CalDav server (Horde Groupware). The app works seamlessly. The functionality and the range of views and screen layouts suits me perfectly. Where I want to change things, the configuration options for this app allow a great deal of customisation. I‚Äôve read one or two reviews where the reviewer regards the range of configuration options as quite daunting and that I can understand but Calengoo works very well straight out of the box if one doesn‚Äôt want to get into detail of configuration. And the extra 5 stars? These I would happily give for the quality of support this app gets from its developer. Initially, I encountered an issue around tasks synchronisation that was related to the way in which CalDav is implemented on the Horde server. The developer responded to my enquiry within a couple of hours and from then on was very prompt in providing updates and responses to my feedback until the issue was resolved entirely. This is superb product support. Congratulations Dominique.",5,3,,2020-02-13 06:25:10,,

I didn't even have a smartphone back then. Initially, the draw for me was the simple ability of syncing desktop Google Calendar and Tasks to the tablet/phone. But as time goes on, I am now entrenched in the phone and very little Google desktop usage. it is the perfect app for me. I am a list person and Task lists are ideal for so many things. The calendar functions perfectly with lots of hooks for easy event manipulation. I recently uncovered the New-Event and New-Task widgets that are AWESOME. I love all the display customizations possible. And my settings were easily portable from phone to phone. They may be overwhelming to some (as noted in an earlier review) and maybe the defaults could be improved for new users, but I love all the settings available to get it just right for me. Developer support top notch too! I just reported a small cosmetic bug and I'm sure he will fix it right away. My only suggestion is that I would like to see more icons/emojis to decorate events with and to categorize/filter them so I could remove from my view all the ones not of interest (maps, numbers). Also multiple emojies on an event could be useful.",5,6,1.0.178,2019-10-05 06:44:41,,

The Google search for address has become more streamlined and this better. It's still not a case of offering a Google search pop up as you type in the address field like Google calendar but you now just tap the search button and get a Google map window pop up to search in. In some ways this is better as you can drop pin for the address if you're unsure of the spelling. The android wear face is simple and functional too displaying events around the clock face. And first class developer support too. My current default app as a result of all this and much much more goodness.

First off the Material update on Android is beautiful. The UI is very easy to navigate even though there are tons of customizations. There is a learning curve to those. Calengoo also has brilliant Evernote integration which is hard to find, allowing you to attach an EN note to an event or task and syncing with EN Reminders. There are other attachment possibilities. The tasks have their own tab but are also integrated with the calendar. I was never a Google Task person but Calengoo makes it so easy and pleasurable. The 1 thing missing for me is a local desktop app but I hear its being worked on. Highly recommend this app. Really love opening it every day.",5,2,1.0.163,2015-10-12 08:09:37,,

On the left of the home button is the 'recently used' button, and a long press brings up the multi window. On the right is the back button and a long press brings up the menu of many applications, but not with Calengoo.  With Calengoo it boots me out of the program altogether.

I have used many task apps and this is the first one I've found which offers full functionality AND truly syncs with Google. Recurrence for ToDo items has always been an issue with other apps I've tried. Because the task recurrence is stored in the event note, the recurrence is retained over all your devices. It is also retained if you have to reinstall the app. You can even check off a recurring task in Google Calendar and Calengoo will resolve the recurrence and Google will catch up. Brilliant. The interface is not quite as polished as some other calendar/ToDos but is immensely customizable.

Prior to purchasing it, I tried a bunch of other Calendar program beginning with the built-in Android calendar.  The short version is that I found too many limitations and weaknesses with the other products.  Once I started using Calengoo, I was sold.  You can also configure everything in Calengoo, which is awesome!  Over the years I have emailed the developer with recommendations for improvements and to point out minor bugs (nothing that prevented the app from working correctly).  Most recently I noticed that the location font in my agenda widget was not changeable even though there was a setting for it.  I contacted the developer and Dominique responded right away as has been the case every time I have made contact.  He requested that I send my configuration file, which I did.  I got a response a day later stating that the problem had been found:  The font worked on the scrolling widget, but not the fixed widget.  He made the update and sent me the updated version, which works perfectly.  Total 5 stars to the developer!

Agenda for the Psion was and still is one of the best calendar applications ever. Unfortunately, Psion, a British company, could not survive the competition from Palm and ended up going out of business. CES Dewar, who helped write Agenda, then wrote DateBk for the Palm. Still a great program for the Palm that syncs with the Palm Desktop or Outlook. Before I retired, I couldn't live without it. It literally ran my entire consulting business including billable hours, and generating invoices from Outlook. Unfortunately, Palm went belly up alsp. CESD wrote Pimlical for the Android and Windows. Another great program but very complex, and syncing does not work as well as DateBk/Outlook. That sent me looking for a new calendar program. After trying about 10 of them, CalenGoo is the one.  Calengoo is the best non-CESD calendar program out there. Spend the $5.99 and spend the time going through the excellent tutorial.

I really love this app - it's undoubtedly the best calendar I've tried. It doesn't seem to be able to sync directly Google's 'fixed' calendars though, like public holidays or contacts birthdays; I can only get them by syncing via the stock Android calendar.A useful addition would be the ability to include Internet calendars independently of Google - Google's refresh rate of these is so abysmal that it's hardly worth bothering, but sometimes it's necessary. I can barely function without my Tripit calendar but still have to resort to MS Outlook to be sure I'm looking at an up-to-date version.

In trying to disentangle myself from Google, I've set up a calendar on my own cloud server and I need an app that can sync using CALDAV. Calengoo can't.

Google tasks are relatively lame not allowing categorization or prioritization. Okay, Google does allow multiple lists which in a way can be used to categorize tasks, but YOU CAN ONLY VIEW ONE LIST AT A TIME. Aaaarrrgh. Calengoo uses lists (like Google), but has multiple views that allow the lists to be viewed in a consecutive stream in Tasks or combined in the Agenda view. You can also choose whether to show all tasks in the various calendar views. AND you can prioritize tasks in a 1-5 format and they're displayed accordingly. Excellent implementation.   So now my Google tasks and calendar are extremely usable on my Android phone and Android Kindle, but the implementation on my real laptop computer running Windows is still the same lame implementation of the native Google apps. Until i came across a program called Bluestack which I installed (free) on my laptop. Bluestack allows you to run your Android apps on a Windows based computer, so now I have the functionality of Calengoo on my Windows laptop - does it get any better?",5,2,1.0.90,2013-01-26 16:34:40,,

So I always try out 3rd party apps as soon as I change platforms. This is my first Android device and finding this calendar was a godsend. It has all the functions and features you're likely to need, has a logical layout and very easy to use.The week view is particularly good with the days spread out horizontally rather than the more usual grid formation and events are shown in individual vertical blocks. This layout is much easier to read at a glance. There's loads of options to personalise it but it's not overburdened with gimmicks (except perhaps for too many widgets!). It will sync directly with Google Calendar and if you use multiple calendars on Google with different colours for each calendar this app will sync them all and display the same colours on the handset. It works flawlessly and syncing to Google Calendar works both ways almost instantly. If you or your company use Google Calender this is the perfect handset app. I've tried many calendars on loads of different platforms but this is the best I've used.

Loads of widgets options, sync options, Google tasks and maybe the most important for me, reminders with snooze options you can customize.  You can pick 4 different snooze options for instance, 10 minutes, 3 hours, two days, etc.  All 4 appear to choose from, which is important to me.  Sometimes I put a task or event that can be put off for an hour or two, some I can put off for a day or two.  I can't think of hardly any feature that you can't customize on Calengoo either.

YES, I can finally CROSS OFF completed calendar events as if they were todo tasks!!   If the alarm goes off for an event, I can either dismiss it or snooze it for any amount of time so it will keep nagging you until you dismiss it.  You can also set one or multiple reminders for a specific event or task, as far in advance as you want (minutes/days/weeks), a great feature that many other apps lack.

First, other calendar apps on Android sync with Google calendar via the phone's built-in Android calendar. But there is a huge limitation that is not widely known -- Android's calendar syncs only about 30 days into the past, and only about 1 year into the future. So if today (late April, 2012) I go into Gcal on my browser, and enter a new event for (say) August 2013, that event WILL NOT sync down to my phone (at least, not until about August this year, when it's about a year away). This is useless for someone like me, who needs to plan things way in advance. Calengoo gets around this limitation by allowing the user to instead sync DIRECTLY with Google calendar -- all events (past & future) are synced.  Second, I am a heavy user of tasks. Calengoo syncs to Google tasks, but I don't much like them (too rudimentary). Calengoo does NOT sync to Toodledo (at least, as of today) BUT it has ""floating"" events that can be checked off. These work VERY well in place of tasks. I set up a new calendar on Google, and I use it exclusively for these floating events. You can set times, check them off and drag & drop to rearrange them.

Show tasks in the calendar views. 4. A widget that presents a homepage summary of upcoming events and tasks. I got this and much more with Calengoo. First of all, it works with Ice Cream Sandwich (many did not)! Calengoo meet all of my requirements and provided useful capabilities that I did not know I wanted (if not needed). For me, Calengoo's greatest strength is its configurability. (This might also be considered a weakness by some folks.) Whenever I thought something was missing, digging down into the settings resulted in just the display that I wanted.
