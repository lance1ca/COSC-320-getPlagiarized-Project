You can hardly do wrong with one of the OGs of the genre. If you know where to go, it'll take about 15 hours to beat the game. Minor tweaks make this version cleaner than the original NES game. It's closer to the release for the original PlayStation. Pros: Attacks will automatically target the next monster of your target dies. Visuals are nice. Movement is fast. Bosses have been tuned down, though the last boss is actually quite hard. Instant death spells don't hit as often. Spell levels exist but are just informal gates that restrict you from getting too strong too early. You draw MP from a single pool like most RPGs. Larger inventory.

We can't control the music or sfx at all, and that makes it annoying to not be able to (for example) stream music at the same time. Plus, certain sfx are MUCH louder than they need to be (in battle).

Requiring an internet connection won't impact me, but I could see that being a deal breaker for many.",4,2,5.2,2018-10-03 00:41:56,,

but still the same game in all aspects. After a short while noticed the 
game has a severe crashing problem. Anything from poison to haste can 
potentially crash the game, anytime you fight a boss that can hit you with 
a status effect you have a 50/50 shot the game will crash. If you cast a 
higher level spell, the game may crash. Any overworld animation other than 
basic movement crashes the game 99% of the time. Contacted the developer 
several times with zero response. Uninstall and reinstallation solved 
nothing but deletion of my game progress. For a game that required money 
and internet access to play, I expected far better. Funny I purchased this 
instead of using an emulator to support them, guess this shows is how much 
they care. Was planning to purchase other final fantasy titles, but if this

While breaking lines  with the enter key, I learned that it did not work. Please bear with the wall of text. Due to the character limit on Google Play, this will be brief. Yes, the controls are awkward to get used to, but efficient, fantastic when you understand their use, and easy to understand. The requirement for internet is annoying, but not part of the actual game, so I'm ignoring that. Besides. It's a great game, best played when you have full immersion. So you shouldn't be playing it when you can't play anything else anyway.  Now onto the game itself. From the NES release, it's gotten much less grindy, but still takes some effort. Square has hit a perfect balance. The world is fun to explore, there are many secrets, optional content, and so much is explained with so little phrases. You understand the world, the direction is fantastic, and you actually have to think about what to do. It's not mindless, and that's amazing! The only real issue I have with it is how easy it is to win. It's not hard to fix either, just numbers.  Spoilers ahead.  Enemies only need more health and more attacks. Kraken has used a grand total of two attacks against me. All it took to counter it was NulFrost and Protera. Or one cast from my Knight and White Wizard each. Then a mere three turns off attacks and Thundaga casts wiped it without me even needing to heal. This was at level 33 for clarification. Tiamat was even easier than this. Which is so unfortunate, because I remember having to prepare, and attempt the Marsh Caves multiple times even after I prepared, which made me love this world so much more: it was unforgiving, dangerous, and even if you were chosen heroes, you still faced risk.  Spoilers over.  Another balancing issue is the Thief. Promoted class as Ninja. Yes, they're strong, but you could pick a Monk/Master, who has more health, more Evasion, more damage, and is cheaper to equip. The sacrifice is that they can't use Black magic, but is that even necessary when you have a white, black, and red mage to pick from?  Overall, the game provides an amazing experience where you put yourself in the shoes of the hero(s), experiencing growth, and watching progression, discovering a world. This is somewhat mitigated by the awkward use of controls, but those only last the first hour of the game, which is hardly any time at all.   And fortunately, due to the class selection, and ability to do things in almost any order from the get go, there is so much replay value. You can forge your own stories and relationships between the Characters you make in your head, which is just a huge beauty of open world games, which I would consider this.  But is it worth it? If Square made this into a remastered HD version, 3D Models, Voice Acting, and an improved soundtrack, I would, without a doubt, buy it for the full price of a Triple A title. In fact, I hope a remastered edition of that calibur comes out, so I can experience this again in an even more immersive fashion than before. *Hint, hint, nudge, nudge.  Keep up the good work, Square.",5,0,5.2,2017-12-13 16:53:35,,

Of course, it was my first experience with an RPG, and I didn't know about grinding or much of anything else back then.  This game really took me back to those days with some fresher graphics to appease my modern self. The game has obviously been made easier for the modern audience, but I still found the nostalgia of it to be quite enjoyable. If you never played the original, you'll probably find this game to be too simple.. but this is where many RPGs got their start.  The dpad is not so bad. Obviously a separate controller would be ideal, but we have to work with the touch screen. I found it easiest to just move in straight lines.. and there was only one hallway in the game that was diagonal so I had to move right/down 10 times.. that was a bit tedious.  I ran with 3 fighters and 1 red mage and found the difficulty curve to be about right as someone that just wanted to enjoy the game without getting frustrated by any fights.  Overall, I loved my time with the game and it delivered what I'd expect for a mobile port.",5,4,5.0,2016-03-01 05:05:07,,

Have played it many times... but I'm sorely disappointed in this release of it!  For one, it seems like the bonus dungeons have been removed... which is odd, considering that they'd likely have had to work to remove it during the port process. I was pretty angry to find this out AFTER the fact -- I was all leveled up and ready to tackle the challenge, but for nothing. Jerks.  I'm also quite annoyed with the controls. It seems like an excessive amount of taps are required to do anything, and I would rather have just played the game on an emulator. For example, using an item or casting a spell that effects all enemies or allies requires yet another tap -- just use the dang thing! -- and that's after several taps just to get to the item. There should have been a ""repeat last action"" button...  Another annoyance, but minor: the music in the game is a perfect loop, and always has been. But, instead of just restarting to loop, they have it fade out slowly after some time, then BAM, starts over again at full volume, but not in sync...  It's still a classic, and worth the few bucks if you haven't played it before.",2,1,4.0,2014-07-15 17:41:13,,

There is a slight graphics glitch with the player-character sprites in battle -- it looks like they are made up of several squares that don't quite line up (1px lines cross through them) -- hardly notice it after a while. As other have stated, it is still annoying that the game checks your license key at start up, and you can't leave the game and return where you were without a license check.

It runs pretty well on my system (Samsung Galaxy S3) although it does lag occasionally.  The downsides:  First, the game checks your license every single time you start it.  Which stinks if you're somewhere you can't get internet access, such as a subway tunnel.  Second, it handles interruptions from other apps very, very poorly.  Anything that interrupts it, such as a calendar reminder, shuts the game down entirely, necessitating a reboot.  The quicksave feature saves this from being catastrophic, since it automatically quicksaves when interrupted, but if you were in the middle of combat, the game does not save this fact and you will resume standing on the map where the encounter occurred.  I just hope that doesn't cause anything catastrophic if I happen to get a phone call while in a scripted battle.  When problems 1 and 2 combine, it really sucks because you get booted out of your game and aren't allowed to start it up again.",4,2,4.0,2013-11-20 17:55:27,,

If I had to wait for the food, it wouldn't be worth the cost and lack of general quality. I play games on my phone in short bursts whenever I get a few minutes. That's the beauty of mobile gaming. Not the case with this game. The license check itself requires a solid minute, and if you minimize the game, guess what? You can't even open it again without another license check. This is a great game but if you're looking to play it little by little do yourself a favor and download an emulator and a ROM. This is a miserable mobile gaming experience.

The black border on the left and right maybe annoying, but if you are really into the game, you won't notice it.  Square Enix, remove the multiple verification and you'll get 5 stars. Until then, only 3.",3,9,4.0,2013-08-27 08:01:33,,
