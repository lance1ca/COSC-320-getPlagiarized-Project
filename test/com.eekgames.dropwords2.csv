My scores are suddenly higher. I hope that doesn't mean the game has suddenly been made easier, as the hard mode used is the same. I think the game just works more quickly, and saves time. Overall, this new version is a great improvement. Indeed, it would have been nice if I had gotten some notice of the revision while using the old one obliviously.üòâ",5,1,2.4,2020-09-26 18:01:05,,
