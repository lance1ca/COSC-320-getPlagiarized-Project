One of the 
best things about it is the lack of micro transactions, there's no easy way 
to beat the game but to relax and enjoy the ride. I played through the 
original D&D and I'm enjoying this one just as much. I do have two small 
gripes overall though after hitting 90%+ completion; lack of loot and 
unbalanced resources. The loot system works as a three piece set dependant 
on each characters class and is automatically applied with no user input. 
You are hard locked into a specific play style based off your classes, 
which would be fine if I wasn't lvl 53+ on all characters with only one 
class early unlocked as far as it can be. If there could be an advantage 
for playing a different class it is almost immediately lost because of how 
low it's affinity is and how difficult it is to find nuggets and shards. 
Golz and upgrade material are very limited resources from what I've seen. I 
grinded through as many sidequests as possible early on to farm golz and 
still had allot of trouble keeping my different classes' gear up to spec. 
As I mentioned above I also had trouble upgrading each class due to a lack 
of nuggets and shards. I ended up picking one class of each character and 
stuck with them through most of the game until I had extra resources to 
spend. To be fair these aren't game breaking or otherwise horrible, just 
design choices that I don't agree with 100%. If you like old school RPG's 
I'd recommend this and the original above all else in the Play store.",5,2,1.7.5.2,2018-08-01 14:07:49,,

It's very frustrating that the game lacks a proper main menu, which means that if it isn't set to load the right save file (i.e. new device or you changed profile) you'll need to skip through the tutorial before it'll let you open the menu. I had a very infuriating issue with the cloud save system not working properly and uploading a blank save (that or my other device just couldn't load that save and somehow managed to reupload a blank save?).

I wasn't crazy about the game at first. I still think  it could use a lot of work on the ""flow"". The main game does have a sequence... There are quests that lead to other quests in an orderly fashion, but after the main game ""ends"" there is much, much more to do. There were so many updates that is wasn't easy to know where to go and what to do in the best order. That being said, this a long game with plenty to do. Things did get very interesting the closer I got to actually being ""done"". Even after finishing, the arena fighting went on from there...   I enjoyed the arena more than a lot of the regular game and I'm usually not crazy about purely fighting games, but with the rewards being more resources and other upgrades to fight with, it was a lot of fun. I'm not nearly as versed with rpg's as I'm sure most of the players here are. Judging from the few I have played, this one is good. I would recommend the game. Although the original is better, you really can't go wrong with this one considering the price. I will say that if you're looking to complete the game 100% you will likely be disappointed. From what I've seen in the forums and in the arena, there weren't many players that did complete it. There's quite a bit that isn't really worth bothering with and isn't necessary and there is not a full walkthrough to be found. You'll find pieces of information in the forum, but even in there, as in the game at times, it's difficult to navigate. A bit of advice for any new player... time to figure out AutoCast (main play) and AutoBattle (arena)... (they're the same thing). It's quite confusing and for most of the game I didn't bother with it. Once I got serious about arena fighting it became essential to learn. Even after jamming my way to first place in the gold league, I didn't understand parts of it. I decided to go back into the game to try to complete more of it, at that point I played around with AutoCast until I finally figured everything out. After that, getting some of the achievements I hadn't done and looking for more of the secrets was a lot easier. The last word here is... TAKE THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT AUTOCAST/AUTOBATTLE earlier, rather than later. Just play around with it until you get it. Trust me... It will be worth it. Did I mention there are three final bosses... The last one was probably the most challenging I've ever fought in any game. Kudos to the developers for really putting their all into this.",4,2,1.7.5.1,2018-03-19 07:40:19,,

It's frustrating to lose, come back and not get to try again. If I could, I'd ask for a refund and play the free version only.  Changing my review to one. I attempted to submit the above complaint through the app. It said I needed to create an account, so I did and it erased my game progress to start a whole new game.

we are trully sorry about your loss. Usually, when you create a new account and sync saves, the game ask you which files to keep.

The story is good while you may not be hooked at first it is a good plot to go through. There is one thing I wish though, I wish there are more classes such as a dragoon class or a monk class that uses their fists. I'm hoping the developers add classes like that in the future. But so far the classes barbarian, black guard, warrior, pyromancer (Johnny), cleric, knight, bard, pirate (mike), wizard, sorcerer, necromancer, summoner (nigel), chef, rogue, ranger, and the soon to be released adventurer (francis) I'm enjoying greatly.

The grammar is AWFUL and can make it challenging to figure out what you're supposed to do in various quests. Not just grammar either, but the English is very broken and confusing. The overall flow of the game is quite disjointed, leaving you wondering what order you're supposed to do things in and discovering later that you missed entire main quests that you should have already completed. It's okay to have multiple side quests going on in random order but the main quests shouldn't feel all jumbled. Additionally,  there are apparently some bug issues with the spaghetti temple and a figure 8 you're supposed to walk. When you begin the figure 8 in the starting square, the altar should light up and get brighter as you walk around in the proper path.  But for some of us, the altar never activates at the starting square so no matter how many perfect figure eights you walk, the monster will never appear, meaning you can't progress in that part of the story. There are also numerous areas of the map that you can't reach with no explanation as to why or when it will be available. Why release a game that's only partially finished?! Overall, I'm frustrated because after 60 hours of game play, I can't progress in the game because of a bug. I've wasted so much time on this game, I wish I had never ordered it.",3,9,1.6.7.8,2017-04-11 23:02:35,,

Do&De Advanced si conferma un gioco divertente e godibile, con tanto humour ed una storia avvincente. Interessanti alcune modifiche alle meccaniche del gioco, ma la grafica ed il sonoro non sono all'altezza del primo episodio. Problema in parte risolvibile azzerando il volume degli accompagnamenti musicali, di poco spessore ed alla lunga ripetitivi. Trama ""acchiappante"" e coinvolgente come sempre e tante novità che lo differenziano dal primo episodio, anche se a volte diventa un po' macchinoso ed eccessivo da gestire. Peccato in particolare per il sistema di salvataggio poco consono sia ad un RPG che ad un gioco per smartphone, sprovvisto di un pulsante per uscire dal gioco. Il primo era fatto così bene che mi ha creato delle aspettative molto alte nel confronto della versione Advanced, aspettative che non sono state del tutto soddisfatte pur con buoni risultati.",4,1,1.6.2.3,2016-12-21 05:58:04,"Ciao Mattia, grazie per la tua recensione!

I thought it was part of the plot so I clicked download and a nerds strike back screen popped up and the game crashed.  When I went back in.... my game data was gone.  UPDATE: Their tech support got back to me a day or two after but their suggestion to use the online sync didn't work even though I thought I had activated it.  I ended up quickly powerleveling back to where I was anyway so I'll revise my rating to 4.  The game has some stability issues but overall it was quite enjoyable.

The tongue and cheek, subtle and at times not so subtle humor is where the game shines however, with references to your favorite nerd culture moments that will keep you smirking the whole way through.
