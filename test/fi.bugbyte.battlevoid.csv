My, personal, favorite ship design is the BSE Siege as it feels like an old WWII battleship in the sense that, when upgraded enough, it can crack straight through enemy defenses with ease and take on entire fleets by itself. However, it feels as though the unit selection is a bit lacking due to each of the ships feeling, generally, the same. One why I think this could be resolved is if BugByte added the ability to play has other factions and have access to that faction's tech tree, ships, and weapons.

Fills a void mobile devices have been lacking. A real time action space strategy game with fully customizable units. Taylor an offensive/defense using research. Difficulty levels for all players. Not complicated. Requires patience as each level is a new game within a larger campaign. It is kept interesting by how difficult it can be at higher difficulties. Lack of story line leads game play into a skirmish style gameplay. Restarting from zero every battle. In my opinion, a comprehensive story line option where progressive gameplay improves a player's balanced start position within each battle, is linear, and story progression occurs based on a previous win/defeat is the only missing component for this game. If this existed I would then call it an RPG. As all of the games mechanics are great, a good ""story"" mode could be franchised into many different games.

Then the flaws began to become noticeable. A feature I figure was intended to drag out gameplay seems to be my biggest reason to stop playing. Everytime you complete a mission offensive or defensive the next mission requires REUNLOCKING everything. So basically you need to waste ample amounts of time to beat the next map. The ai is also heavily buffed forcing you to turtle through quick hit and runs till you get strong enough to flank the enemy or suffer utter defeat. This all in about a 15min-2hr struggle. Seems extremely unrewarding to be punished by forcing us to re-research and unlock tech each end every single map. Hate to say it but skip this game and go back to battlevoid: harbinger, at least you didn't get screwed after every battle and moving to the next map. Also, for battlevoid harbinger, add in the marine cloner. Would be nice to have a feature that shoulda been implemented in the first place.",2,23,1.43,2018-04-01 22:20:09,,

Not yet polished. Have the other bugbyte games, bought this first day. Played through twice. Specifics: (Pixel with latest Android if it matters) - Red X (cancel?) in build queue does nothing. - Squad buttons either do nothing or are unintuitive, and aren't mentioned in tutorial or help screens. - Taps on dialog screens that miss the dialog's control 'bleed through' to the underlying main interface. General: - Too random. Regardless of Threat Level, scenarios range from 1) a carrier and destroyer attack your battlestation before you've had time or resources to do more than build two scythes (tugboats) to 2) you waltze through the sector wondering where the foes are.  - Fog of War seems like a last minute hack. It just blocks your view. Permanent features like capture point locations shouldn't be forgotten when you lose sight. It shouldn't block hpbars of visible ships or reveal hpbars of invisible ships. As far as I can tell it doesn't affect the AI at all. - Starting each mission from scratch makes them somewhat tedious, and combined with the randomness erodes any sense of progress, other than the sector map slowly turning blue.",3,2,1.38,2017-11-08 13:51:49,"Hi!

I would love to get my $5 back.   Every mission is the exact same: start with one station, conquer the map.  So once you have played a single mission, you have experienced everything the game has to offer.   And what is on offer, frankly, is a poorly designed mess of an RTS. Unlike many other RTS games (or Harbinger) non of your research or unlocks carry across missions, so you have to repeat everything every mission. Unlocked a weapon last mission? Go ahead and unlock it again. Built a big fleet? Nothing survives, including your custom ship designs.  And everything takes freaking forever to unlock. The top tier weapons take over 10 minutes each to research. Every. Single. Mission. You would need to play dozens of games to earn enough credits to unlock all of the higher tier ships, instead of that coming normally with advancing the campaign, like with any good RTS. That is the kind of ""Skinner Box"" exploitation that you see in free-to-pay scam games, not a paid game.  The developer, at the start of November 2017, announced they had reduced research times, which is technically true.

There is a steep learning curve and ship movements need tuning. Also the game unpauses after ordering one Marine ship causing me to pause again and again to send several waves of Marines to a ship.

Just different. Heres why. U lose the roguelike wonder of drops from enemy ship. You always start each battle with super basic weaponry. Not even missiles. You have to upgrade tech to get it. About 15 mins in. Instead you get a semblance of grand strategy which is a campaign map. Particle effects have been dumbed down probably due to volume, so the oomph of 5 projectile cannons firing in burst mode has been lost. No change in ""strategy"". There is still no firing arcs. All weapons are mounted on turrets that swivel instantly to where enemy ship is. Means there is no such thing as flanking. Strategy is stacking multiple ships on top of each other (they can occupy the same space) and just as one of ships is about to die, move the full hp ship forward to tank the damage. Wash rinse repeat. Attrition. Not strategy. So separating your ships from battle group is guaranteed suicide. Needs to take a page out of Homeworld 2, where some weapons can only shoot forward, so putting your ships far apart, and flanking, makes much more sense as ships need to turn slowly to aim at you. So its a different game than Harbinger. Not better. I prefered harbinger. 2 hours in this game i got bored.",3,3,1.33,2017-10-27 17:07:12,,

Well done bugbyte!!! Having to research the same upgrades again and again is a bit tiresome, there should be a way to spend your battlepoints to ""lock"" some upgrades and have them ""pre-researched"" on future missions (within the same campaign anyway). ""squad"" and ""select all"" buttons are very helpful but wouldn't it be awesome if it also had a ""formation"" button? Also there is a great staple from harbinger that we all love and greatly miss... BSE Trademark!!! The controls are quite intuitive and easy to manage and the gameplay can suck you in for a good couple of hours at a time, once again, well done!!!!",5,18,1.33,2017-10-25 11:40:55,,
