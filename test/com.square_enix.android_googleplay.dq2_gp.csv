That said, these epic DQ games deserve better implementation and are less enjoyable than the originals. Most notably, the D-pad control is poor in all of the ported DQ games released thus far. Why they didn't use the same dynamic D-pad that was used in FF3/4 is beyond me. Portrait-only mode is very obnoxious when trying to play on a tablet. The English translation is worse than the original, however I do enjoy the unintentional humor.",4,17,1.0.0,2014-10-09 19:10:59,,
