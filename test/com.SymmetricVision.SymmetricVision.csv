Combineable effects / sliders would be cool - maybe some other distortions.

Your mentioned features are in progress and Im working on them every single day. App is made for a specific purpose which is not sharing. I'm only working on sharing features because people have requested them. I can't make a perfect app in the first try, I can only improve by iteration. Thank you :)",2021-02-07 23:44:16

I have to be completely honest, I don't quite understand why people find this so accurate. I feel that anyone from the ""outside"" would find this app gaudy and ridiculous. Which is not fair to psychedelic experience, which is everything but that. Technology is nowhere near good enough to even begin making decent replications. But certainly better than what's out there. Good work. Keep it up.",3,0,,2021-01-27 06:51:38,"Thank you for the review. I think its pretty clear to anyone who has had psychedelic experiences, that no human or machine will ever be able to replicate completely subjective human experiences fully, especially people who decide to buy this. I would never open the app with expectation that it will be like the real thing.

Can you recheck the apps Permissions, specifically storage. Some phones kinda ignore storage permissions and they need to be enabled separately.
