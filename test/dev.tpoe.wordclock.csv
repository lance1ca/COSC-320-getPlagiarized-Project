Nope. Developer has been great and is looking into the issue. Hope to be able to update my review again if sorted out.",3,1,,2021-01-25 09:08:37,"Hi Brendan,

this is a common Google Play bug. It takes Google some time to update the purchase status for all of your devices and stores. Normally you should be able to download the watch face after around 15 minutes.
