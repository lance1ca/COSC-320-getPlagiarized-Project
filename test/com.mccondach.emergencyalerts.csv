After recieving reply from developer ive decieded to uninstall this app. Its not what i was looking for.,3,0,2.4.0.8,2021-01-19 14:01:26,"Hello Scott, thanks for the feedback. The app doesnt send out alerts, it depends on other apps creating notifications (e.g. email, SMS) e.g. if you get an email saying ""HIGH WINDS"" from a weather service, you can create a rule in Emergency Alert to play an audio alert (even on silent). Pls contact support if you need help with rules, happy to help!",2021-01-19 13:29:35
