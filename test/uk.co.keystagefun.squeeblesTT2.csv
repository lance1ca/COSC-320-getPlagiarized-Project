I emailed the developer and was surprised to get a prompt and helpful responses - with several prompt follow up responses - including an offer to refund the purchase price. Given that the app costs only ¬£2 the level of customer service is brilliant. I have had slower / worst customer service for software costing over ¬£100.  One minor issue is that for an older child they have to tediously work through the kiddy levels (e.g. 2 to 5 times tables) in order to progress to the trickier levels - because of the way the reward system works.
