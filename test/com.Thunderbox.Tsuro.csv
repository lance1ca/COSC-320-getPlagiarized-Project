I linked to my Facebook account, but still found nobody in my friends list. It took me a while to figure out that it probably only shows people who actually have the game and have linked with Facebook. It also took me forever to figure out how to add a friend manually. It was in the most unintuitive place! And now that I have added a friend, all I see is a friend code instead of a proper name. I also can't delete anyone from the friend's list. I also can't figure out a way to stop an online game that's in progress.

I also like that this app tracks things like how long your path is and how many loops you make. The one thing this app is missing, though, is a way to zoom in for a close up view of sections of the board.  Also, sometimes the player name placard obscures the view of the top left squares of the game board. I'd like to have the ability to either remove the placard (maybe swipe it to collapse it?) and/or be able to drag the board around for better views.",4,47,1.3.3,2017-06-28 10:55:21,,

When placing stones, if someone places theirs in the wrong spot (easy to do because the starting positions are very close together) you have to clear the entire board and start over from scratch.  It would be nice if the ""Tap here to switch the rules"" tab actually showed which rule is currently selected.  During the AI's turn(s) my tiles are no longer visible. I like to look at my tiles while waiting for my turn so I can plan ahead. There is no reason to hide my tiles in single player mode.  An option to not animate the AI turns would be really nice.  Sitting waiting for the AI to move just for the sake of pretty animations gets old fast.  Online multi-player doesn't appear to work. I just keep getting the message ""Error retrieving data. We'll keep trying.""  Although you can have up to 7 AI players, there doesn't appear to be a way to have only AI players.  When a game ends a dialog box pops up over the board so there is no way to review what happened during the game.  An option to simply repeat the last setup would save a lot of time.",3,3,1.1.1,2016-03-12 14:04:07,,
