What is the point in having Rummikub when you can't play the game against an actual person.  2) The CPU can move groups of tiles and can do the most amazing things in 60 seconds but you can't. If you want to break up a ""run"" you have to break it up one by one.  3) There's no actual score. Yes you can see at the end of a round how much you scored for that particular round but there's no actual score in the game itself. i.e. all you can actually play is one round of Rummikub  4) The AI is ridiculously stupid. At least 70% of the time they leave the joker at the end of an open set which allows the user to always have a free joker. The AI will also have ALL of the tiles racked but will be ""unable"" to play.  5) There are silly bugs like not always splitting sets properly when a tile is placed on the board.
