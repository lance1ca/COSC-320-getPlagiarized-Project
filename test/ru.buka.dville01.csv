The best Point & Click Adventure I've found on the app store. The story is interesting and funny. The puzzles are of varying difficulty (which I like - too many easy ones and there's no sense of accomplishment; too many hard ones and the game loses its flow). I've had to use a walkthrough on a couple of parts, but I'm guessing better players can get through on their own. I'm looking forward to the rest of the game!",5,9,1.1.6,2019-08-10 12:39:59,,
