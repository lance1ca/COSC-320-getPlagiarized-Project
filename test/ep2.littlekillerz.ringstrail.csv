I love games that make you feel like you're on a real journey; that make the miles you travel feel like a proper epic travelling distance. Half Life 2 did it, Final Fantasy X did it, and ToI does it too. Although the travelling can be quite mundane - tapping on flora and fauna - and the way the game is programmed (layering image files) makes it unnecessarily large and slow, it's still addictive and entertaining.

The moment you get your 3rd party member, suddenly the fights become crazy. Even if you rest all the time, you'll get these 2 vultures that devour half of your party's hp just by casting 1 poison debuff, then shred you to pieces. Again, it's very obvious the devs want you to spend real money on microtransactions.  Another problem is the writing. It's much weaker than in the first game. In the first game, you would get to know the characters, discover their background, their past, and in general they were interesting characters. The dialog was generally what I'd rate 4 stars.  However, in this game, the writers decided all you ever need to know about the characters is that Kepri is female. Not even 2 hours into the game and I already counted 10x more gender references than in the entirety of the first game. Hammering gender in is not enough to write a good character. This is why I've given it 1 star less than the first game.  Also, the performance is very poor even on good devices. I don't think my Nokia 6.1 is a low spec device, but the game seems to be running at around 15 fps.  Skip this one.",1,0,,2018-09-10 11:38:38,,

While the game itself is a good game it does fall short of first game. Feels like a cheap DLC. This game now has micro-transactions, before hand you would be able to play these Episodes without feeling any pressure at all to pay real life money for a game you completely purchased for. Does offer branching choices but seem limited and as if they would end up having the same outcomes! Couldn't be bothered to replay as it seems combat difficulty spikes out of nowhere to encourage you to pay real life money. I have nothing against supporting hard working developers, but design here surely encourages you to buy gear or you can just get defeated in combat by an enemy way out of your league, as to no fault of your own because of this difficulty spike, ( coming from a experienced old-school RPG player) about 4 or 5 times and wait for the game to naturally weaken it's NPC's so the battles become actually possible.",3,1,6.14,2018-01-15 22:01:42,"Hi Jose, sorry we let you down, we didn't intend to do anything you suggest.

Many people have requested the ability to run from a battle. The problem we have is that all battles are set in a narrative. We would have to write in an escape option for every battle and sometimes fleeing just doesn't make sense in the current narrative.

I admit ep2 is harder than ep1. But you are getting caught up on a couple special battles. The Circle of Djinns, they are a recurring challenge you are meant to lose at low level and win at high level. The dragon between Vasena and Tortha you are not supposed to win it when you first encounter it. Hint get SILENCE spell.

Sorry about the difficulty.

Try lowering the difficulty
Each time you try a battle it gets easier
Be sure to level
Keep morale high
Camp after battles 
Heal ailments in temples
Stay in taverns and get drinks
Keep a stock of all provisions
Max out heal
Dont depend only on AI

Will often waste a turn to walk right into death knowing that HP is at critical rather than healing. Bad conditions far out weigh good ones which caused me to constantly have no money to buy weapons or heal wounds or buy new skills. Wounds would be healed by resting in most games. here wounds are fixed separately with gold but HP is not restored...pay gold again to restore HP. Would then set out and 10 seconds into journey an event would cause the same old ailment that I can't fix for days unless I head back right back to the city. BTW all this is on normal difficulty. People and animals are constantly robbing or hurting you outside of battle in events so that when you reach an actual battle you are at a disadvantage.

You can restart any battle to try different tactics, but in far too many cases, these random battles are impossible to win, forcing you to reload your last save file and losing up to a half hour of gameplay if you're not diligent in saving.

Alot of great events... but I found that the events that need higher persuasion/stealth tend to happen early in the game... as well I have to comment on the blood apes... way too strong for how small your party is... and combined with the small map area, makes it hard to get the experience you need without farming the savanna back and forth for the alchemy/hunting xp. Also needing furs in the desert in winter?? O.o.. Still very much love the game.. bought it asap, and can't wait for more!!",4,0,3.13,2014-03-04 18:45:57,"Thanks, Kris.
We are getting some complaints about he blood apes, so those will be slightly nerfed. 
Deserts get very cold at night. Water absorbs heat and regulates temperature. Arid climates therefore fluctuate in temperature.
I will relay the message about persuasion and stealth to the writing team. They will be sacked. jk",2014-03-04 20:11:27

Great story, very nicely different from Episode 1. Gameplay remains solid, and has been tuned better such that input into combat is necessary, rather than leaving the AI on autopilot now.   One small nitpick: although I definitely like the way you can level Kepri as a fighter or mage, or combination of the two, it is a little annoying how she keeps on trying to advance to the forward rank in battle even if you've only levelled her as a mage.  Edit: Thanks for the reply!  Didn't realise there was that level of granularity in AI configuration.  It would be nice to have to ability to set AI outside of combat through the menus.  Keep up the good work!",5,0,3.13,2014-03-04 14:37:21,"Edit: You could also arm Kepri with a bow or give her a combat spell so she has something she can do when she's not buffing, but still remain in the back rank.

Andrew,

Thanks for the nice review! Please set Kepri's AI to buff only, or tell her to ignore her melee combat skills. Send us an email if you want to discuss. 

Thanks,

Sorry we let you down. Perhaps its because you played the enhanced version of EP1 which included much of what we improved while developing EP2. This game was developed by the exact same writing team . Version 3.09 fixes all known bugs. Please contact us for a full refund and please do not advice people to pirate.
