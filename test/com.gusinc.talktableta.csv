The app comes with multiple different page layouts on installation, and has the ability to create custom pages as well. However, I did have to explore myself the various settings and options available in the app, and how they changed the functionality and interface of the app. The degree of customization is great, such as custom buttons with personal images and sound recordings for true personalization of expression but these options can feel a little overwhelming for those that are unfamiliar with AAC apps or communication apps in general. Some sort of in app onboarding to help new users customize the app to their communication needs where new users can view the default page types/layouts easily when they first start the app, and a help/guide function or library explaining the different options available to users as far as customization and control goes would be very helpful.

I need the scanning function as this app is for my 3 year old who has limited motor function. Also cannot scroll the page.........I have just read your reply, and it implies that you do not consider me a customer. Or perhaps some of your customers are more equal than others? Have you not considered making it possible to enable/disable the  scrolling function, that way  you could satisfy all of your customers requirements?. I have emailed this suggestion to you but have not recieved a response on your thoughts. Its rather disappointing that you choose to respond publically with a smartass comment instead of continously striving to make your app more functional for the purposes which it was intended. My child has cerebral palsy and no motor skills . Your marketing did not specify that the scanning function is not available yet for Android. We have wasted R890 on this application as it is useless to us without the scanning AND scrolling function.",1,14,4.0.0.46,2015-09-08 12:19:44,"We sincerely apologize to you if you misunderstood our response.
