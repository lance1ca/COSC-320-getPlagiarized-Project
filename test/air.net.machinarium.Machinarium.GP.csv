It's a decent puzzle adventure. A bit on the short side given the price, but you can tell that you're paying for a genuine and painstakingly handcrafted game with well balanced story and hand drawn artwork in every animation of every scene. So, what it lacks for in length of game, it makes up for in immersion. If you like adventure games, do yourself a favor and buy this! A piece of warning though, if you're contemplating buying this game because some ""games like this game"" website recommended it for similarities to The Room series... Don't buy it for that reason. It's just as satisfying, but is not the same aside from being a puzzler.. I add that last part because I first contemplated purchasing Machinarium for that very reason.

The game is funny, cute, and quirky. It has a strong plot line, good character interaction, and lots of fun moments, but some of the puzzles are way too hard. Thankfully, the built-in hints show you how to solve most puzzles, but I wish the hints provided only one clue at a time to help you figure out the puzzles on your own. In fairness, some of the puzzles are quite intriguing and can be solved with reasonable effort through logic. I enjoyed the arcade games very much. :) I completed the whole adventure, but the game needs better instructions to remove the unnecessary frustrations that take away from the fun.

One is that there is no indication of what you can interact with. The thing you need to interact with looks no different than the backgrounds, which is just ridiculous.  Secondly, once you have an object that you can use in some way with something else in your field of view, the robot shakes his head like an idiot unless you are literally right on top of whatever it is that the object will work with. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to waste your time going from room to room when you've decided something won't work, only to discover that if the robot had been mere pixels closer he would've interacted.

Some puzzles require you to tap the same object twice or many times in a row, and some objects don't stand out at all from the background. In the PC version apparently you get a cursor effect, but here you get nothing.

I used to play the old adventure games made by Sierra and LucasArts and this reminded me of the old days. This game was not easy to beat and I went into it with the idea that I would not have to ""cheat"" and use the walkthrough, but I failed. I ended up using it on three puzzles. All I can say is that I am glad that they included the walk through with the game as a tool to be used if necessary. If you knew the answers to all of the puzzles this game would take about 1-2 hours to fully play through, but if you don't know the puzzles and you don't know where to go and what to do next this game takes at least 6 plus hours to complete.

I guess my complaint is that every puzzle has to be solved in a strict linear sequence and in one certain order with most puzzles requiring you to figure out the correct sequence of clicks/taps as well as solve the puzzle.  Basically its more of a collection of demanding puzzles strung together with a thin story than it is an adventure with well paced game play.

The system doesn't want to recognize the item. Which in turn causes a lot of wasted time repeatedly trying to get the item to work.

So far this has been top one along with the remastered Broken Sword series on android. Beautiful Story.  Really captivating.  It's a kinda lonely-sad-enjoyment on the machine world.  The music and environmental sounds make it impressive.  The artistic drawing in the game also.  The game story seems precise.  (It's not long and its not short).  I finished it and the game has a very nice ending.  If you are not fond of reading in the game and hate so much instructions it also makes up for it.  I understand there's also a version on PC. If there would be a boxed game sold for this.  I would buy it without thinking twice, or even an Art Book of this.  I hope the developers make another game like this Monkey Island, Indiana Jones, Day of the Tentacle (Lucasarts / formerly Lucasfilms on the 1990s time) or the old Sierra on Line on its AGI games, (Those where their light years).  This is a game you would not regret.  Its a highly comercial game very cheap and high quality.  Its for kids, grownups, and even you can share the puzzles with them.

The plot is interesting, and the characters can be quite captivating despite the lack of any dialogue in the game (there are pop-up speech/thought bubbles with cutesy little animations in lieu of text, which works well).  Most of the puzzles were logical (a measure of this sort of game in my opinion is how many of the puzzles I think were stupid. In this case, very few if any).  There was a lot of pixel hunting, made harder by the touch interface. This was par for the course in the 90s, but I'm not sure that it's still the best way to go; I think that Broken Sword did a good job by highlighting all of the touchable things near where you'd just clicked, preventing your wondering if that thing you'd saw that would solve your puzzle were just a piece of the background or not.  The pencil sketch/water colour artwork is beautiful, and the music is excellent too.

The puzzles were fun and interactive, and the story, while weird, was pretty good.  However I have 2 complaints. There were some puzzles that were terrible on the touch screen. Either it was not responsive, not really obvious that I had to do a certain motion, or the Nexus 7 screen was slightly too big to do the movements comfortably.  The other complaint is that the game is way too short to be worth the 5 dollar price. I finished this game in about 5-6 hours. For 5 bucks I hope to get 10-15 hours out of a game. This game has zero replay value, so my money (while it was fun) is now wasted.",3,1,1.6.11,2013-03-25 06:48:55,,
