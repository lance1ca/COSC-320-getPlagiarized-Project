I take it slow, stop at every spice bar along the way, and I still lose crew from just random stuff happening. For example: 1) Start new game on easy. 2) take 10 minutes customizing crew talents. 3) Take a mission (moral is high) and leave for target planet a short distance away. 4) Lose 5 crew after on arrival because a single random event happened on the way. 5) ???? What???? I want to play the game! Not try to hire and balance crew every few minutes. It's too bad, this game has potential. My advice to the developers, either balance events that cause crew moral to take a hit, or give the option to turn it off! Disappointed",1,0,3.1.29,2021-02-09 04:54:54,,

It's like a chilled out version of Elite with a surprising amount of story to be found out there in the stars. I find myself having the most fun racing against time to accomplish missions trying to keep my standing clean with all the factions as best I can. The reason this is fun for me is that satisfying all the factions is nigh on impossible. The reputation system almost entirely depends on gaining favor with one faction by harming another faction. The original star traders game was actually excellent in this regard, but this spiritual successor ramps up this aspect of the game by a lot. Most importantly in this regard, the game gives you unfolding narratives to follow that will influence the standing you have with the factions, and that to me is the real coup de gras here. The game rewards you to make the game harder on yourself once you finish all the story missions at the beginning of it should you choose to continue with what the game had to offer in the previous iteration, and best yet, within the narrative of these story missions the game tells you ""Hey. You don't have to participate in this. If you do it will impact your reputation a bunch when you start operating without the framework of these story missions""",5,2,3.0.25,2020-01-07 20:45:05,,

The contacts you meet will offer missions to enhance your reputation with factions (or turn you into a war criminal with other factions).

Had to uninstall it to get the sound to stop; not even closing it works. 2. Tutorial is almost non-existent, and saving doesn't help due to what seems to be an autosave overwrite. In other words, there's no way to fix it when you think you're doing one thing, but you're actually doing something else. 3. Too easy to screw up, esp. with a touchpad; for example, I wasn't even ready to leave the planet, but all of a sudden I was zipping off to empty space. If you could at least autosave and autoload TO THE EXACT POINT AND STATE THAT YOU SAVED, it looks like it could be at least three to four stars. Combine that with permadeath, and a stray touch leading to permadeath, and this is a loser as is; add to that the price of seven bucks... grr. The biggest killer is the contrast with what looks to be a really cool game, with much replay and depth, and the points above and it adds up to a really aggravating disappointment. Add: it mostly likely _is_ an issue with chromebook, most particularly the touchpad; I've had issues there regarding cursor jump and multi-touch with other apps, though not to this degree.

This latest installment in the Star Trader universe is far more accessible than the previous titles despite being very deep.  Gameplay is deep, visuals are great. Music is well varied. Follow the story or don't. Be the character you want from a merciful diplomat to ruthless pirate. Nomadic explorer or simple spice trader? Sure.  UI is a bit small on mobile devices but completely manageable and a scaling UI is on the roadmap so there's that.",5,1,2.4.69,2019-02-01 06:27:02,Hopefully the UI scaling patch will improve the situation and let players configure the exact screen size they want. We do hear the feedback regarding the UI size and are working to try to implement some fixes. Thanks for playing.,2019-02-01 11:27:43
