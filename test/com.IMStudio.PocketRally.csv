This is most likely because I'm so picky about everything. For example: the controls are bad with touchscreen, but work beautifully with a controller. Also, the game modes should vary more than Quick Race and Challenge Mode. Yes they are fun, but the Challenge I has uneccesarily long races (6+ minutes in some cases.) However, this game is definitely worth the money: beautiful graphics, accurate car models, beautiful tracks, and you can play for hours on end without your device heating up, as it does with other games. Pros/Cons balance out in this game, and I still enjoy it despite its flaws.

It is so relaxing to drive and maybe reconsider the day, in the evening, while playing the game. And just relax while driving. This game will never get boring.

I just want to unlock the Lancia Stratos, but I can't get there because there is no way to beat the time trial.  It should say something that I can beat any race other cars challenge in the first try, but the time trails take hundreds of attempts to whittle down your time until it will take it.  Also, the cars seem to get slower as you unlock new ones.  The first car actually could beat the time I'm currently trying to beat, but the stupid Subaru can't...

I've been looking for a racing game where the course has bends in it and colliding with bystanders isn't a feature. This one ticks those boxes and has beautiful graphics, realistic physics, and decent controls, to boot.  Favorite aspects: the cars are modeled after actual rally cars (e.g., you start with a Castrol Toyota Celica), and it matters a lot whether the car you're in is FWD, RWD, or AWD.  Minor beef: I use the tilt steering mode, but it still seems like the turning comes in increments instead of relating smoothly to how much I tilt the phone.

The idea graphics and physics are awsome but they can be better with a few little teaks.   The graphics are spot on if anything I'd say a little more depth and editing the spots between grass and dirt, it looks a tad off to me.  With the gameplay I'd say a little more grip on the dirt to make more edgy when racing. But on the road I'd give it quite a bit more because even though it is diffrent then dirt in reality if u should stick a little more through a corner. 4/5",4,0,1.0.2,2013-09-05 20:09:19,,

The handling of each car has a relatively realistic feel and unique handling, as a result, each car requires you to adjust your driving style.  The textures and of each course and car as well as detail put into each are somewhere between the PS1 and PS2 level of detail.  If I could list any cons, it would be brakes and application of power on each car.  The tires used on each car seem a bit too grippy.  On top of that, the brakes on each seem to be lacking, in fact, on hairpin turns in the Ancient city course, throwing the car into a slide slows the car down more effectively than applying threshold braking (straight-line braking), which is not true to life.  In future updates, I would hope to have access to car upgrades and a more realistic braking system.  Perhaps you could incorporate a sliding bar, very similar to the one used for the steering input system (I am not very fond of the tilt system and do not own an xperia controller) to control gas and braking a little more precisely.  Other than that, this is a fantastic mobile game!",4,1,1.0.2,2013-08-27 18:57:36,,

I would agree with some of the other reviews in that it's ridiculous that you can only do 60 kmh but I suspect this is more to do with the frame rate than anything else, increase the speed and it will of course effect the draw rate and the graphics quality which I think the developer is well aware of but will work on for future updates.
