If you've developed the proper skills in perfectly driving these cars, then it's not about driving anymore but about the beauty of sliding around every curve without ever using the break. You'll be the winner if you develop the skill of taking each curve with a lead-foot on the accelerator. And after a while it even isn't anymore about winning, but only more about the pure meditative beauty of relaxation while sliding or floating all around the racetrack.

This is most likely because I'm so picky about everything. For example: the controls are bad with touchscreen, but work beautifully with a controller. Also, the game modes should vary more than Quick Race and Challenge Mode. Yes they are fun, but the Challenge I has uneccesarily long races (6+ minutes in some cases.) However, this game is definitely worth the money: beautiful graphics, accurate car models, beautiful tracks, and you can play for hours on end without your device heating up, as it does with other games. Pros/Cons balance out in this game, and I still enjoy it despite its flaws.  Other notable things about this game are: beautiful camera angles and physics that change according to drivetrain.",4,7,1.3.4,2018-03-10 22:18:53,"We will keep working on it 🚗🚐🚙🚔🚕🚖

Gameplay is good and a lot of fun. Graphics are good. It has well known licensed cars with great variety (Toyota Celica gt4, subaru wrx, rally raid truck, lancia stratos, and a group B Peugeot 205 t16).   Also has decent camera views. Sadly no cockpit view but it does have good hood and Chase cams plus an overhead camera that surprisingly functions well (think motorstorm RC).   Has a career mode and a few tracks. Seems like a great game for $1 and personally I think it's much for fun to play than Colin McRae rally even with touch controls, let alone gamepad which is totally superior.

I've been looking for a racing game where the course has bends in it and colliding with bystanders isn't a feature. This one ticks those boxes and has beautiful graphics, realistic physics, and decent controls, to boot.  Favorite aspects: the cars are modeled after actual rally cars (e.g., you start with a Castrol Toyota Celica), and it matters a lot whether the car you're in is FWD, RWD, or AWD.  Minor beef: I use the tilt steering mode, but it still seems like the turning comes in increments instead of relating smoothly to how much I tilt the phone.

For a car game it packs a punch in graphics anf driving skills with 30 challenges to test you in a beautiful scenery. Worth the buy. You have to drift correctly to beat the challenges. You really don't need brakes to accomplish that...just ease off on the gas. It is challenging and so much fun to play for a $0.99 game. So worth it! You can also adjust the sensitivity to provide great control during game play. So try it out!,5,0,1.1.1,2014-06-19 08:41:35,,

The idea graphics and physics are awsome but they can be better with a few little teaks.   The graphics are spot on if anything I'd say a little more depth and editing the spots between grass and dirt, it looks a tad off to me.  With the gameplay I'd say a little more grip on the dirt to make more edgy when racing. But on the road I'd give it quite a bit more because even though it is diffrent then dirt in reality if u should stick a little more through a corner. 4/5",4,0,1.0.2,2013-09-05 20:09:19,,

The handling of each car has a relatively realistic feel and unique handling, as a result, each car requires you to adjust your driving style.  The textures and of each course and car as well as detail put into each are somewhere between the PS1 and PS2 level of detail.  If I could list any cons, it would be brakes and application of power on each car.  The tires used on each car seem a bit too grippy.  On top of that, the brakes on each seem to be lacking, in fact, on hairpin turns in the Ancient city course, throwing the car into a slide slows the car down more effectively than applying threshold braking (straight-line braking), which is not true to life.  In future updates, I would hope to have access to car upgrades and a more realistic braking system.  Perhaps you could incorporate a sliding bar, very similar to the one used for the steering input system (I am not very fond of the tilt system and do not own an xperia controller) to control gas and braking a little more precisely.

Also the speedo only 70kph top speed for a high performance rally car ? That's like 40mph :/  On straights the car is too slow. On corners its fine.   Seems like a lot of races.  For 60pence its a good game but it needs improvement.,3,1,1.0.1,2013-05-28 05:23:59,,

I would agree with some of the other reviews in that it's ridiculous that you can only do 60 kmh but I suspect this is more to do with the frame rate than anything else, increase the speed and it will of course effect the draw rate and the graphics quality which I think the developer is well aware of but will work on for future updates.
