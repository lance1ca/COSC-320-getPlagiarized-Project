Of the three books I think this game is the most balanced in terms of the viable play styles and has the best character development. The game's main story is linear, with the ""side quests"" adding flavor to the play style you chose for your character.  Choices are basically stat checks, with successes being rewarding and failures punishing.   In a sense this game is ""immersive"", you are not a god/goddess amongst men. You have more weaknesses than strengths, which makes your choices VERY important. Even if you pour all your effort into one stat, that stat won't be used in every situation, and if you spread your stats out too much you won't be strong enough to pull through when you need a higher stat.  The charm of this game is the difficulty, the struggle is part of this game. You could say this is the ""dark souls"" of interactive novels, when victory is based on intimate knowledge of the game rather than luck.   The legacy dlc is highkey pay2win, adding mostly to stat boosts, and very little to narrative and world building.

You doesn't have the correct outcome AND you doesn't progress stat-wise. (While the challenges begin increasingly more difficult). Don't we say what doesn't kill is makes us stronger ? And that you learn best by your mistakes ? I really think it's a bad design. Because you are forced from the first choice to choose what you want to do and you can't change during the story (and forget about being a jack of all trades) - This is more a amelioration than a problem but when you show the number, why don't you show them before making a choice ? That way we could be able to make a choice while really knowing g what they do, instead of having to guess our gain. It'll not spoil us about the difficulty of a task nor if the stats we choose are useful for the ending we want but it'll make the choices less random when two choices both appalling arrive.
