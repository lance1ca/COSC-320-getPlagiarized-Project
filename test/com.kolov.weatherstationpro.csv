Mount it to a wall, set the sleep timer to NEVER, now it's a weather station. Perfect! Don't plan on using the tablet ever again, battery will be shot and the weather layout will be burnt into the display within months.

You don't even need to set the sleep timer, the app does it automatically. And the layout will only be burnt in, if you have an OLED display. LCD takes no damage.",2019-12-18 23:32:22
