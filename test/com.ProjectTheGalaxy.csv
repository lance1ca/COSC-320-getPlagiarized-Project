Also, creative has an issue. Survival u craft and place, once u place the slot becomes open for u to interact with the items and stuff. Creative, the item stays there and active.

Super Boring at the moment. Ideas for improvement: More attributes: Warmth. Energy. So you have to stay warm and sleep to restore energy. Going in water and walking outdoors at night reduces warmth. Special areas with Hard enemies but special rsre loot. Like a cave or something.. Ability to name containers to help with organisations. Different sized crates. Different types of 3d printers which produce different level items at different speeds. For example, you need a tribal 3d printer to craft camp fires. Weather effects. Emotional effects. For example, being in the rain lowers warmth and happiness, eating certain foods boost happiness. Happiness affects build speed, rare loot drop rate and damage resistance. Another idea would be random events that happen.. For example, a meteor crashes and you can mine it for rare ore, or a huge alien monster appears and you can kill it for great food and maybe some loot. My last suggestion is instead of having different laser miner guns. You have one, but there are loads of different mods, in a skill tree (like the game deadspace).

However, I do feel the game needs a bit more to it, the plasma blaster we have may act as a weapon and mining tool, but I feel as if we end up on relying on it a bit too much, adding different weapons such as pistols and knifes should spice up combat a bit. Furthermore if the multiplayer aspect is going to be a good thing to implement to play with friends and what not, we should be able to customize our space man (different colors for the suit, different bits and pieces of the suits armor or details, etc).

I know you are working on new updates, so i think u probably must put more enemies in the game, in the night over all. I made my first car and I didnt know why I made infinity cars. We need a checkpoint when a new day starts for save our progress. Put a button for go back to main menu. I drived my car in the river... U can make this game better, just fix it.

Other than that the game seems very very fun. The controls need a bit work. Walking and aiming whilst shooting is really bad now. Maybe make it so you can keep pressed with shooting and can aim like that!,4,0,0.0.1,2018-10-27 00:13:59,ok i think i need to work on it,2018-10-27 00:35:29
