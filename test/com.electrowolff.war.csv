Even if these suggestions are ignored, I'd probably still continue to play this game.  1.  Air Raid Bug - Once you use a bomber on a complex, you know for the rest of the game if it's going to hit and when it does, it does the exact damage every time.  If it is shot down on the first attempt, all bombers attempting on the same complex will be shot down.  2.  Players placing troops on boarders and you can't identify which troops are in which country.  Even when you watch the replay.  I've only ran across a couple players that do this and I immediately resign after the first round.  Cheap way to play, and takes away from the purpose of the game.  3.  Multiplayer game should open with bidding.  I've played this game more times than I can count and can tell you with absolute certainty that the axis have the advantage.  You need way to many battles early on to go in your favor if playing the allies to have a chance.  Placing bids before you start with the ipc's will allow the team to use those ipc's to purchase units and place them before the game starts to equalize game play and even skill level.",3,1,2.0.6,2018-01-09 23:55:34,,

It appears the ai is functioning at normal speed but the visuals and delays in interactions on the players part makes it hard to play. 5/5 still the best game ever, even unplayable.  Amazing, it's the only word to describe the nostalgia, polish, and the intuitive gameplay. It's impossible for me to get people to actually play the board game so this is a god send. Wish we had this digital game 15 years ago. Would definitely pay for expansions. Would love to see land grab start, random or personal placement of starting troops, 5 player online multiplayer, and custom territory spoils placement.",5,5,2.0.6,2017-10-17 18:58:38,,

What more can I say? A&A was one of my favorite board games, growing up, and now it's easily accessible on my cell phone. I've already played 4 campaigns, and this game is great! No more need to hall out the board game and needlessly set up plastic pieces, anymore. Now, I can play a quick, or long game without the need for setup, and can enjoy the single player experience I've always had with the game, since I could never find anyone to play the board game with.  Controls are a little difficult, as there are so many pieces on the board, but you can quickly zoom in and double tap to select the units you want to select.  Gameplay is fast and fierce and I sometimes find the A.I. using very smart, and tactical moves.   Graphics remind me of the exact layout of the original hoard game, including the detailed pieces of each faction's land, air, and sea units.  If you're unfamiliar with how AA plays, there's a tutorial section included in the game.   Overall, if you're even a slight AA fan, this game deserves it's collection on your phone. It's a shame Hasbro, or whomever produces the board game hasn't gotten into this, as this is a fantastic remake.  Now, if the developer can make the D-Day and Pacific expansion packs, this would be the definitive version.  Thanks for your work, lone ranger!",3,2,2.0.6,2017-10-05 14:01:53,,

I still have it but I've moved and just don't have the same type of gaming friends. Anyway, I jumped at the chance to buy a similar game for my phone. It's certainly one of those games that makes me wonder where the time went. Even on my LGMS500'S screen size, the game is very enjoyable. I may add more to my review later, but I'd like to ask a question of the developer. Is it possible to bomb the factories of your opponents so they lose money, like in A&A? Update: This update is like an early Christmas gift. You made a great game even better. One question: Is there an updated tutorial which covers the additional play, e.g., strategic bombing of factories? I think I'm doing it right because after I attack, an exploding  bomb icon appears over the factory I was targeting. Either way, an updated tutorial or instructions would help. Thanks again for such a great gaming value.",5,4,2.0.2,2015-12-13 21:27:28,I haven't had a chance to do a 1942 tutorial yet although I'd like to.

This android game is excellent and fun to play. But, the AI is too weak. For example, three fighters will try to land in one carrier result in loss of one fighter. AI does not know what to do near the end of the game. AI is too conservative in many cases. I would suggest to tweak the AI to have two modes, aggressive and passive. And, fast movement should be default since there is no reason to watch AI's movement slowly.",4,1,1.0.6,2013-10-18 19:54:42,,
