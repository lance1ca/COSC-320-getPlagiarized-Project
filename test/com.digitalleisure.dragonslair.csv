You now have to make a move 1 full second or more before the corresponding video scene. Original review: Not quite arcade accurate, despite its claims. First, and most disappointing, the timing of moves is far too strict. Most moves have to be made BEFORE the corresponding visual cue appears, which means this is purely a game of memorization instead of a test of reaction time. If  you think the original arcade game was like that, find a classic arcade game collector with an original Dragon's Lair and see for yourself. Second, some game aspects are wrong: You can't grab the burning ropes until the ledge is almost receded, for example. None of the falling discs have nine stops, even though in the arcade game certain falling disc scenes (such as the mirrored ones) always did.  Digital Leisure gets it wrong yet again ... but this is the closest they've come to getting it right.",2,8,1.0,2016-09-28 09:25:44,,

Install complete and enjoyment begun! *********************** Previous review: I long to be taken back to my childhood gaming days and finally finish the adventures of Dragon's Lair that I never got to finish in the arcade. I would love to give this a 5 star, but the consistent installation problems are keeping me from doing that.  The DEMO version worked great, so I took the plunge and bought the full version, eagerly anticipating the journey down memory lane. Alas, all I get are frozen screens during the download and unpacking of additional resources. I've tried multiple, multiple times and it keeps getting stuck at different spots along the installation. Sometimes at Loading, sometimes at Unpacking, but always before finishing. When or If I ever get the installation completed, I will love it and hold it and stroke it gently, telling it what an amazing piece of retro gaming history it is.

Plays well, has the arcade mode, home mode and you can also run the attract video for fun.  Couple of small nits:  1) On my phone the timing for the horse and barrel rides appears to be off.  You have to enter the movements well before you see the subsequent scene.  2) The keypad highlight indicator scheme doesn't work too well when you consider your thumb is blocking your view of at least 50% of the keypad.  What would make sense is to make a mini-indicator icon and place it just above the keypad.  The mini-indicator would just show ^,v,<,>,ATK but would be clearly visible at all times.
