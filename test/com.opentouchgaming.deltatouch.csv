The price this port goes for is only to help cover the play store licence. The developer even will help if you bought this port on other store fronts and updates are behind on it like in my case.(purchased on amazon app store originally). you can play on android 4.1 and up offline.

It has a very good touch controls scheme that's easy to use, and if you don't want to use touch controls, controller support is excellent with universal mapping across all four source ports.  This app includes four source ports, including the current (as of this writing) version of Chocolate Doom and a recent build of GZDoom for use with most mods. What's awesome is that I can playback Doom demos on the go while using only a fraction of my mobile data; instead of streaming video, I can watch Doom demos played natively through a Doom source port. Also, multiplayer in Chocolate Doom works great.  Compatibility and performance is great. Although I would recommend a port of the Eternity Engine source port over Doom Retro; not that Doom Retro is a bad source port, but the Eternity Engine would be great to have on Android for its features and demo compatibility.

your work on Google Play. All your past great work getting taken off due to 
being wrongfully flagged, forced to use Amazon's Appstore. Once someone 
told me your Delta app finally dropped, like your past work I didn't even 
hesitate to support you with a purchase, your great work speaks for itself. 
It looks like you're possibly working with others to get Delta as great as 
it is, forcing me to dump Kokak's apps now (Hexen, Heretic, Doom GLES 
work). My only suggestion is I hope in the future Rise of the Triad gets 
supported as you did have a beta of it years ago but it never was completed 
(?). Blood would be great if supported as well. Keep up the great work

For anyone unfamiliar with D-Touch, this allows you to play Doom on the go. From the near-vanilla Chocolate Doom to the very moddable GZDoom, there's a port in here you'll like.  Touch screen controls are usually clunky but Open Touch did better than the average mobile port's controls, with fully customizable button layout and two analog sticks that follow your fingers. It also has gamepad support for anyone who wants a bit more control.  I totally recommend buying this if you have a somewhat powerful device to take Doom (and other mods/TCs) on the go.",5,5,1.2,2018-02-03 07:06:20,,
