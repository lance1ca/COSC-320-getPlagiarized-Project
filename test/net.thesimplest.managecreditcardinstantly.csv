It could also use a widget. 2. Some of my credit cards have 23 or 25 or 28 day grace periods. Does the app figure that out or could there be a way to input that? Lastly could it keep track of which card to use to have the longest grace period and to maintain a certain percent utilization on each card?

Automatically it will record the entries of different credit card      and also will have the smart technology or logic to figure out the duplicate entries. 4. Settlement of the credit card payment could be finalized form the SMS and maybe it can ask for approving it. 5. Reading of the Amex card it would have smarter technology as AMEX card have a 15 digits number and bank sometimes send as either last three digits or last five digits. For 5 digit it is working fine but for 3 digits it fails to detect.     It would be better if 3 digits also can be considered for automatic entries. 6.
