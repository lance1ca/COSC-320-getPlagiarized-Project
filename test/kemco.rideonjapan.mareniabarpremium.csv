Cute story elements as well. FYI, there aren't very many resources out there if you need tips, since it's new. But there is a recipe list, which really helps you avoid wasting ingredients. When deciding what to make for your menu, I recommend filtering by price so you can see which recipes will make the most profit, then getting those ingredients. (Black pepper is expensive but worth it. Mixed Salt goes into many lucrative recipes.) Good luck!",5,3,1.1.4g,2021-01-17 08:11:29,,

Aside from the storyline, the characters, and some new tools and recipes, the basic plot, the villain's looks and name, basic gameplay, and controls are all the same as Adventure Bar Story. The only complaints I have are the small gamepad, lack of BL, and the lack of differences between this and Adventure Bar Story. I mean, I adore ABS, but like, if you're just gonna do this, just call it ABS2. Oh well, I actually just started playing recently, so I can't really give an in-depth analysis, but I sorta got the gist of it. Love the game.",5,132,1.1.1g,2018-09-30 01:46:46,,
