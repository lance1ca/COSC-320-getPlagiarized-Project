The scaling is correct on my Nexus 10, whereas other apps had the scaling so far off as to be unreadable. Since it's using AirPlay, it actually treats the tablet as a real monitor, and allows me to use system tools to manage it. Well worth the price! Great job!",5,2,1.1.2,2014-09-07 17:09:04,,

Therefore, only one star review.    **Original Review** Works OK, except the display is stuck in portrait mode.  I would like to use this to receive slides from my iPad, but since the slides are landscape mode, they inefficiently use the display of my android device.  And it would be nice if there were some way to hide the back, home, and apps buttons on the bottom of the screen on a Nexus 7 (2013 edition).  Finally, a bit wonky when making a connection.  I frequently have to close and open the app to make a connection.  However, once the connection is established, it seems to work ok (minus the problem with being stuck in portrait mode).

Reflector is an AirPlay Receiver that you use to mirror your iOS device screen to Android. If you have the PC version it works just like Reflector Windows. It appears in your iOS AirPlay menu.This wouldn't enable you to mirror your PC to Android unless you have another application (such as AirParrot) on your PC. Hope that helps!,2014-07-11 13:54:47
