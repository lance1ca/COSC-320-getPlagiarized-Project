I use it to decode ITTY feeds and it never fails to demodulate all of the text. A fantastic tool. I own several other apps made by Wolphi LLC and they all perform flawlessly.

Been using it for a few years now. Just reinstalled on a replacement android tablet.   It provides everything for the ham radio mode.  Decodes  the websdr beautifully. Open websdr via Firefox find a signal ,then open droid rtty and you will find a panoramic display of signals, same applies to droid psk. So multitasking for RX works well.",5,2,2.12,2017-12-27 21:32:08,,

Very easy to set up and use. I have used it in contests to great effect. I would highly recommend this to anyone , beginner or old hands at digital modes. Give it a try it's great fun especially when propagation is poor. Also try DroidPSK for PSK31 and 63, same layout and set up as DroidRTTY making these two great companion programs. Customer support also excellent very fast replies to queries though I doubt you'll have many as it's all set out so straight forward . Now go get it ! you won't regret it  Frank G4HBI",5,11,2.09,2015-07-31 16:06:36,,
