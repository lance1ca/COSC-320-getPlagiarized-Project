When the characters are talking, there is no sound and I can see their mouths moving and then the sound will turn on and you can hear them speak. But it does skip every other sentence they say.

If the game ends up to be a bit too short, I'm fine with it! Edit: I changed to 4 stars because it seemed they really didn't put much thought into the end of the game. The plot lost all its thrust.

There is at least one puzzle which make absolutely no sense (the instructions differ wildly from the solution in the ""knights and dragons"" puzzle in the courtyard), or seem oddly weird (e.g. what happens when you assemble the clock behind the clockwork dragon), but by and large well done. The HO scenes are notably simpler than in most HOPAs i've played (less ""noise"", so the items are easier to spot), a few have ambiguous terms (e.g., ""bow"" when the HO scene has both a ribbon/bow and a violin bow). Story is cheesy, voice-overs are mostly decent, graphics are typical (good) Artifex quality, music is unmemorable but not annoying.
