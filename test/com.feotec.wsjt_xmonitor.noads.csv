Liked it and wanted more features, so upgraded to PRO version. Works great on my DROID. Quite a few more features than the simpler version. Well worth the measly $1.99 + tax. Money well spent. There are videos on YouTube of it in action. Nice to monitor your WSJT-X in action, via your WIFI.",5,4,2.069,2021-01-03 15:31:16,,

There is a cumbersome workaround but I personally think that this should be mentioned in the app description.,4,1,2.069,2021-01-03 13:53:41,"Actually the latest JTAlert version has fixed the packet forwarding feature (so no cumbersome work-around). Tell JTAlert to forward data to your phone's IP and you're done. One user reported he had to save, close, and restart JTAlert. We should have updated the help webpage by now. Thanks for the (unintended) reminder.",2021-01-03 15:14:34
