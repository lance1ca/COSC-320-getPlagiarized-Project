The tutorial covers up information with the talking heads so you can't see what's going on, and you can't move them or minimise them. It throws concepts at you (like splits) without explaining the terms it's using. The interface is obscure - for example, to tell which information is yours and which is public there's a tiny icon, which I guess indicates the public one? Even the game rules aren't given relevant to the digital game - it's just a pdf of the boardgame rules! If they'd done it properly the rules would at least include explanations of how they were represented in the digital game.

I know this game (and own the board version). This was clearly designed by people that did very little outside testing with new players. You must absorb and nearly memorize the tutorials because this game will do ZERO to explain what's going on in each phase. Icons pop up with no explanation. Your only hope is to keep playing until you just ""get it"". There's just no excuse for the lack of information. You'll see this even in the tutorials where phrases come up that the designers just assume we all know, but I'm sure many don't. Fans of the boardgame will likely rate it high, but new players will have a hell of an unncessary learning curve. As is it feels very much like watching lightning in a bottle. A lot of flashy graphics bouncing up all over the place, but it's just overload. On the plus side, the AI is solid and the game plays brisquely.",2,1,1,2018-09-21 12:23:42,"Hello Rich,
thank you for your feedback. In every screen there is a call to action (the scrolling banner in the back) telling you exactly what is expected.
