Surprisingly good character development. No need to put any extra money, especially because you can start grinding early on. I suggest getting maps from shop before Duapnir rings so you can get great materials early on and develop great equipment. Keeps you wanting to play and develop characters by learning classes and abilities. Good gameplay too, legit TBS game. I gave a four to gameplay only because you're supposed to be playing with 15 characters a map and that's way too much. Too many characters to try to use and get SP. You need to make 10 characters from guild asap, 5 for gameplay (some maps you will get surrounded and out numbered) and 5 for dispatches, which you constantly be doing. Buy maps and send dispatches! Battles are still fun and you douse all characters at first then after main wave of battle you only need a few, and SP becomes difficult to gain even with dual Duapnirs. I put in hours of SP/material grinding. Story is good. Has the feel of a playstore game as opposed to how Fire Emblem feels, but it's similar with added elements. Fun game I would love a sequel and for the sequel to have less characters to use during battle and a better upgrade system as opposed to just switching classes. Great job making this game, it's great. I'm at 30 hours of game play and still not finished campaign or sub events, but have all the legendary gear and almost all classes for each character mastered.",4,0,1.1.2g,2017-08-20 02:34:47,,

This is probably due to the game allowing at least a small degree of customization. As for the set characters, they are a good mix of types. Quirky in a pleasant sort of way.

Not happy about having to spend real money for extra maps in an already paid game. You should be able to tap a character after a move to bring up attack (like you can do with move) so you don't have to go over to the list and select attack.

Story is a bit thin as they dont even refer to the enemy they fought by name. Class customization could of been so much more selecting race and unlocking classes in the guild would of been great! Building structures and seeing your town grow suikoden style would of been awesome too. For tge story this is the weakest part of the game it needs to be flushed out and really build on the charecters story. There are a ton of story arc possibilities that are ended abruptly and without satisfaction.  I offer it as feedback though as the general game is really quite well done and fun.

Took me about 4 hours to beat the game.  I came in hoping for something like Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, and that's actually pretty much what I got. But....light. The skill progression is dumbed down, the game is so short, you don't even reach the 2nd job change for any characters before you hit the final battle unless you grind for no reason (because you don't need to, the game is a little too easy).  You can hire team members, but you don't need to, because as the story progresses, you get enough unique and interesting people the vanilla human fighter/mage/rogue people you can hire are boring and needless. You can't send any of the main storyline people off on their own to gather stuff, so you hire ONE person to do that, and you'll have all the people you can use at any one time.  It was a good game, but would have been a hell of a lot better if it wasn't so frustratingly short. If you're looking for an introductory game to turn-based tactical quad rps, try it out.

I hope More of these are on the way soon. Overall this is a great game only things I have to suggest is making class changing more like you have real choices and the created character could use a way to choose the race you want to give it more depth. The created characters are kind of useless so far and changing classes doesn't actually change anyone's look. Other than that keep it up I hope to see more of these,5,91,1.1.1g,2015-01-03 14:42:31,,

It is in a similar vein as Final Fantasy tactics and Ogre tactics though not as high quality (animations / maps). Pros: good artwork, decent gameplay, crafting, dispatch feature is nice (send  member out on missions to bring back crafting goods) generic but likeable characters.  Cons: rough battle animations, low rez maps, generic story/writing.  Overall not a bad tactical rpg for the price.",4,20,1.1.1g,2015-01-02 11:43:55,,
