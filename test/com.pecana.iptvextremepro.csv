In ""Alternative"" mode seems that phone is becoming a server for Chromecast so the battery is draining faster. There are some crashes during this mode, but thats OK. The main my complain for now is: Replays can be sent to Chromecast only in ""Alternative"" mode. Maybe there is no technical solution to use ""Standard"" with Replays, but why should I change the whole mode, restart the app and then cast Replays? Can you make ability to cast Relays using Chromecast without changing mode?

I run this on my Android TV MiBox 4K. I would like the ability to still have the video feed running in the background whilst in the settings menu. Like the EPG showing on top of the current channel. Would be nice to be able to long press on an entry on the EPG and schedule a recording or reminder or auto tune/switch to a channel. Also maybe consider to allow users to assign options to the D-Pad when long pressing. Thus more options can be programmed like recording and EPGs. Also appears that the developer is actively improving the app.,4,8,45.0,2017-03-07 10:47:32,,
