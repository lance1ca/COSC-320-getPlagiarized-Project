Near the end, that battery wouldn't last until lunch. When I got my Pixel 4 I decided to take better care of its battery. This app helps me do that. I just needed a simple alarm to remind me to disconnect the charging cable when the phone reached the max charge point. I like that this app doesn't try to do too much. It could be prettier, more Material Design.",5,4,19,2020-02-07 18:50:37,Thanks for the 5 stars üëç,2020-02-07 22:49:33

I often found myself frustrated when I saw my phone charged well passed the desired 80%. This app however will replay an alarm every 30 seconds when the phone is fully charged or discharged to the user specified level. I was happy to support the developer and paid for the pro version.",5,5,19,2020-02-04 04:48:57,"Thank you for purchasing the battery alarm app.

I've tried several other Battery Monitor Apps and this is the only one that actually works as expected. It alarms on the low percentage you set and the maximum charge percentage you set.
