(on Oreo 8.1.0). CONGRATULATIONS.üëç After almost 2 (!) years, you finally managed to get rid of this nasty issue/bug where corrupt junk/cache files were still left in the folders after you deleted/moved those files with F-Stop (you could see these cache files by connecting your phone to your PC (Windows 10) and go to the folders in which the files initially were saved.) I believe the solution came with the introduction of the recycle bin (V5.0). SD write permission does now work and also seems to be all encompassing now. Let's hope this issue/bug stays away permanently. Result: Stars: 1---->4. Now that the biggest issue has been dealt with, there is of course still room for improvement (to make it a 5 star app): *BUGS* üî¥Deleting whole folder with files: folder content does not get moved to recycle bin but just gets deleted entirelyüî¥Moving a photo to a newly created folder: when connecting phone to a PC, that newly created folder is empty and the photo is thus not moved into the folder. The photo shows where it originally saved.üî¥ Only in ""nested folders"" you can tap on the 3 dots in the right upper corner to make a folder within a folder. In ""folders"" that option is removed?üî¥About opening a pic in a large folder and then swiping through the pics: when you tap on ‚óÄ to go back, it would be more useful that the position in list view and grid view would change accordingly to the last pic you watched before tapping on ‚óÄ. *SUGGESTIONS* ‚ö´ App lock: open app with (long) password and/or fingerscan to deter nosy people. ‚ö´ Recycle bin lock: password/fingerscan to open recycle bin and also an option to ask PW/fingerscan before deleting a file permanently. ‚ö´ Retention period recycle bin: option to keep recycle bin content permanently and/or at least 90 days. ‚ö´ Customize navigation drawer logo with your own photo (see D-notes app).‚ö´ About endless media viewer: no option to loop videos. Endless media viewer does not include videos.‚ö´Wi-Fi transfer option (Quickpic) + option to access this by PW/fingerscan ‚ö´Extract text (OCR)(Piktures)‚ö´ Video support is falling behind: .wmv, .flv, .mkv files are not supported. Shouldn't be a big deal to add support for those codecs like other video players do (VLC, Awesome Pop-up video etc). Even though F-Stop primarily is a photo software app, it would be nice to only have one app for all your photos/videos. ‚ö´Basic edit software with features (among others) adjusting exposure and adding the date and/or time stamp from EXIF on a photo (yyyy/mm/dd + dd/mm/yyyy).",4,5,3.2.3,2018-10-28 10:59:11,,

This is indeed relatively important to me. 2) Creating a home screen shortcut to an image folder puts the current top image as its icon - this is good and bad - deleting the top image doesn't update the icon.

My first review was based on the fact that I could not get copying files from one nested folder to another to work at all.  After doing some other work on my phone to delete unneeded apps and get some other apps working, copying files between nested folders in F-Stop started working as well.  Maybe due to a couple of phone re-boots?  Anyway, great app!  Between nested folders, tagging, and albums I can't imagine anyone would feel they don't have enough tools to group and organize their image files.  Dinged one star for not having a top level ""turn off the cloud"" option to hide all cloud drive and social media sharing stuff that some of us hate,  and the fact that I can't create a new folder and then say ""move files from ..."" (i.e. pull files INTO the currently open folder in addition to the existing functionality that allows moving files FROM the currently open folder).  And the ability to move entire folders and folder trees is missing (though I hear it's on a todo list.)  Overall good stuff though!

I am impressed that they got back to me within 12 hours on a weekend. They assured me of solutions to several of my issues.   The most serious issue for me is that I only want to use one nested folder as a digital portfolio. That works correctly, BUT, when reopen F-Stop, it goes to a default folder view (or search for folder screen) and you have to navigate back through several steps and find the preferred folder to view. Developer assured me that they are working on this.  One small thing is navigation back from nested folders. You cannot go back to the parent folder with top arrow because of drop down menu, so have to use standard back icon at bottom.  There are a couple of recommendations that I gave to the developer that hopefully will make this a Six Star app!

I just wanted to say I really enjoy using your app. There are two things I feel like would really enhance the use of the app that I think would make using it a more enjoyable experience (they are only small changes!)  1) For the Nested Folders (which is the main reason I chose this app over others):  - Whenever you open the option for nested folders, it always starts off at ""step 1"" which is the selection of the sd card. It would be great and less annoying if we could have the option to start the nested folder tree from a particular folder of our choosing (so everytime you use this option, you won't have to search for the specific folder everytime you chose this option).  2) I love the idea of smart albums within smart albums. However, when you do this, the album within the album does not have any picture previews, just a grey image of a lightbulb. It would be more visually appealing if picture previews of the images inside this folder took the place of the lightbulb!  Thanks for a great app, I hope you take these changes into consideration.",4,3,1.3,2013-05-12 17:20:12,We do plan on addressing all the issues you presented.
