just use one of the machine timers. Could also be great if you have 
multiple washers at home... little boys wanted to have a second washer...",5,0,1.10,2018-04-17 09:26:50,,

Now I can do the wash and dry with great efficiency.  This app is very well designed - easy to use, (intuitive) and simplistic design.  It also has a reference for laundry symbols.  So far it hasn't crashed on me and it seems to work well without interfering with other apps or functions.",5,3,1.10,2012-09-29 10:08:14,,
