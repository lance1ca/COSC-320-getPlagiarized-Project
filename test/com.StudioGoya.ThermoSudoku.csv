It's a total of 40 sudoku's, which equals ~10h gameplay, but shorter than their other apps (afaik).

I am quite sure I am not the only one who would like to see it in the next update of the apps. At the very beginning of each puzzle the 'givens' are in black and the ones we add on the grid are in 'blue'. One can track the digits added especially if the 'highlight errors' have been turned off. Moreover the added digits are blue in the web app used by Simon & Mark.,5,7,1.01,2020-05-23 09:09:15,,
