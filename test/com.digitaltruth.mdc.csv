to be useful, though. Good: -great database -good concept, separate timers 
for the different steps -good enough UI, everything is clear enough and 
fairly concise Bad: -Unstable. App crashes sometimes, timers will randomly 
reset or fail to start, sometimes the wrong timer will start (i.e., the fix 
timer will start instead of the stop bath timer) -Poor split screen 
support. Unstable enough in full screen, but split screen makes it worse. 
-No option to disable the sound. The agitation reminder noise could not be 
more annoying, and just aren't necessary. -No option to make it hands free.

during the development. -Awfully expensive for a glorified stopwatch. I 
like the idea for this app, and I absolutely swear by the database it uses.

development, is unacceptable. It wouldn't be okay for a free app, and 
having to pay for an unusable experience is an insult. In its current
