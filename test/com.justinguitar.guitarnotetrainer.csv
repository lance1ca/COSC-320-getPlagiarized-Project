But, this app feels incomplete. I would like to see an option to specify a particular string or set of strings. As a beginner, I'm concentrating on learning the E and A strings. I am not interested yet in any other strings. Very strange why this hasn't been taken in to consideration.",2,11,1.08,2019-06-05 04:30:06,Just the bottom 2 strings is a very good idea - will have a chat with the developer and see if we can make it happen!,2019-06-10 13:59:11

Much nicer and faster than other similar apps i tried.  Especially like the ability to practice/learn without a timer running (BIG PLUS!!).  This is an excellent app for learning.  Excellent graphics too, you can see that in the pictures, looks like a real guitar fret board right down to the string thickness.  Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn the fret board.  Now you don't need your guitar to practice, you can practice anyplace you can take your device.",5,13,1.08,2019-05-18 10:08:52,Thank you - appreciate the good vibes and very happy you like it!,2019-06-10 13:59:59
