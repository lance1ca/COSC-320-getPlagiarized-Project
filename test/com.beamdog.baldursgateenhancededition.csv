Out of the new characters, Dorn is my absolute favourite. 👌🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5,11,2.5.17.0,2020-07-23 18:11:24,,

You can use a mouse and keyboard, but it's not what you want to do on a tablet. I own all of the Baldur's Gate franchise on PC and was keen to see how the Enchanced Edition played.  Overall, it's good, but is let down by the aforementioned controls. Mainly trying to interact with the environment, like opening small containers and looting bodies, or choosing and NPC to talk to, but the overarching annoyance is trying to move through doors, or to the next area on the map. I've died more times to not being able to get where I'm tapping, than in actually in combat.   You'll tap to open a door, then tap again to enter, except your whole party will just huddle in the doorway as you've not tapped the exact pixel that you are required to, even at full zoom. In combat this is disastrous, especially as you can accidentally select a single party member.  The same happens at the edge of maps, too.   Lastly, some menus don't have 'back' buttons on the screen, you need to summon your Android buttons if you don't have softkeys on your device.   A good port, but needs some polish.

I don't see why these games cannot be saved to as cards. I've put off playing bard because I would love to use the bard hat item in Siege of Dragonspear, also put off finishing the saga because I would love to do a full trilogy run. However I can't find any way to pull this off currently because I cannot transfer data to my sd card. And when uninstalled it leaves ghost files on my phone forcing me to factory reset and losing my saved games anyhow. BUT i am excited for the update so most likely will resort to reset anyhow, thanks for update Beamdog! EDIT: Just as an aside, I did reset my phone, these games are just that good. There is so much replay value in them, and so much passion put in to them. Beamdog has done an excellent job enhancing and porting these titles, if you're on the fence id suggest making the purchase, and don't worry about making the perfect character. Play it once through just exploring and enjoying it, you'll be doing yourself a great service. Any character can beat the game and new update adds story mode. There is a lot of information and you can overwhelm yourself before you even get to creating a character. Edit: Turn nearest neighbor scaling on to raise sharpness back if it doesn't suit you, I like it on with the sprite outlines enabled. I haven't encountered any bugs after I reset my phone so maybe the bugs have to do with new files not integrating well. Playing on a J7 Perx.",5,8,2.5.17.0,2018-08-22 05:55:00,,

different 1,3GHz quad core tablets running Android v4.4.2, v5.2 anzd v7.0 
systems: 1. Installing requires around triple the final size free space in 
the INTERNAL memory, and there is NO warning anywhere about this. Having an 
external card obviously doesn't help at all. I hope they will change that 
for the next version which they have the beta running (2.5), or at least 
hire someone who can make a proper installer. 2. Install fails in 2-4 tries 
out of 5. I have installed these games back and forth over 20 times,total 
when checking out the betas, and am glad I have no data limits. These 4 
infinity engine games are also the only games from the playstore this 
happens with, and I have tried hundreds. 3. The graphics are VERY dark, up 
to a point where at nigh time (in game) and in certain dungeons the screen 
is solid black, and when I adjust brightness high enough to see, the 
lighter parts of the screen are much too bright. This is on two separate 
devices and in every single IE game, stable and beta, PC and Android. The 
graphics have not been designed for LCD screens, and should have been 
adjusted properly. 4. The games in their current state are somewhat laggy 
on my two aforementioned tablets, which is fine, but the betas are 
practically unplayable in their current state. It's the worst lagfest I 
have encountered so far. I hope they get that fixed before the betas go 
live, but knowing the company's track record, I'm not holding my breath. 
Maybe they could offer the current versions as an alternative download... 
Otherwise it's refunds for 4 games. All in all these games themselves are 
some of the best games ever made, but their current and foreseeable future 
state is sadly less than amateurish in application.",1,1,1.3,2018-06-13 09:31:44,"Hello! Thanks for your feedback. Please, report back once the 2.5 patch is released if the experience is better for you.

The voice acting is grating enough to process parmesan cheese and repetitive enough to repetitive enough to repetitive enough to make a broken record sound like a full-cast audiobook. The combat is unintuitive, but to be fair it's also clunky and bad.  In honest defense of this game, the world's depth and design is evident even so many years later. It's just a pity that insufficient effort was made to make this game accessible to players who grew up with other alternatives to the ol' hoop-and-stick. For instance, it's a mighty chore to figure out what a weapon's stats are, who can use what, and even whether one weapon is identical to another weapon. This was probably once attractive complexity, but today it's needless convolution.   Again, if you loved the original, you'll probably love this port.

The last this was updated is in 2015 or so. I was worried about massive black bars on the side. Unreadable text, small buttons and no spen support.   I am happy to say you can play the game full screen (and it looks completely natural/not stretched) using the Samsung game tools to change the game to full screen.   Increase UI size to max ingame (even then it's kinda small)   Spen works great and is perfect for this game. Makes hitting the small UI buttons so much easier, I only use my fingers to zoom in and out (wish I could use the spen button for that)    P.s. the game is very old school, no hand holding. Even the ""tutorial"" is pretty confusing at times. But seriously five this a chance esp if you've never played CRPG's.",5,3,1.3,2018-03-10 08:15:32,"Thank you!

Beamdog has done an excellent job porting this, although if you are a purist who gets all... twitchy, when developers deviate from the original, be aware that they've added some new characters.  Also, the character creation process is markedly different than the original.  It's closer to Baldurs Gate II, but I actually approve of the changes. 1: New sub-classes (pretty much identical to BGII) 2: The total number of points available when rolling stats is now displayed after each roll, so if you're like me and spend 30 minutes re-rolling to get the highest spread possible, it's a huge help 3: New weapon and fighting style proficiencies are available  But wait, there's more!  Beamdog has included an arena where you can make an entire party and engage in fisticuffs with a cornucopia of savage bastards and monsters, all courtesy of this asshat of a Drow named Baeloth.  In an act of outrageous perfidy, he has placed a gaes on you and your kith that requires you to engage in bloodsport for his entertainment.  Good times¡",5,1,1.3,2017-12-13 08:38:36,,

The graphics on my Nexus 10 are very nice. It loads quickly. It runs smoothly - most of the time.  So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Because it has a terrible tendency to crash. Most of the time, it runs fine. But it crashes often enough that I've had to develop the habit of pressing on the save button just before I try something risky, and also just after I succeed at something, such as getting to a town, or killing some enemies. This is on a Nexus 10.   The only other game that I can compare it with is ""The Bard's Tale"" and this is a bit more interesting because I can have companions (support personnel).   -- adding a minor update based on another review. I find it very helpful to ""freeze"" the game when I am directing individual characters, especially in a fight, to be sure that the character I want is selected, the proper weapon selected, and the target is correct.

I have to say, this is probably one of the best RPGs I ever played. The added content really makes the game fun and even more interesting than I originally thought. Deserves a 5/5 and I haven't even played the sequel, which is known to be the best CRPG ever made.  On the tablet it was even somehow more interesting than I initially thought. The only downside was the UI and lack of captions for the buttons/items and some rare occasions when the game crashed all of the sudden. I always felt a bit forced to hold my finger on the magic scrolls and items to confirm what I was doing. Maybe some kind of popup caption for these items would be nice, I am sure this can be done somehow. Maybe having a """"magnifier"" button, which once pressed can be used as a tool to invoke pop-up name or explanations of buttons and items in question.  Also some critical triggers in the game are not highlighted, which causes some confusion and forces the player to look at a ""let's play"" or ""walk-through"" on what to press. For instance the ""biers"" in Durlag's Tower. I did not have a clue what to do on the second and the fourth level, because the triggers were not highlighted.",5,0,1.3,2015-01-24 11:49:15,,

Get it. 'nuff said. For those of you (like myself) who missed out on playing BG in its prime, yet love true class driven, complex party types of RPGs, get this NOW.  For some background, even though I always loved RPG games, I missed out on BG when it came out (I think I was occupied RTS games at the time.) When I got back into computer RPGs, I jumped into all the Elder Scrolls games, then Dragon Age, and others along the way. And although those were fun and great games, they missed 'the feel,' in one or another, of what I wanted - more of a classic D&D experience.   This game is not flashy and is not an action RPG. What drew me in is the depth of class creation possibilities coupled with the myriad of party setups you could have with the NPCs. Put it this way, I've barely even started this game and already have multiple save files since I'm not even sure what class, mutli-class, or dual class I want to play. If you ever thought ""I miss pen and paper RPGs"" then just get started with this game already.    The only negative is the time this game sucks from your life :)",5,0,1.3,2015-01-17 07:47:42,,

If you are looking for an old-school RPG experience, stop reading the reviews and buy this right now. I tried this briefly on a Galaxy Tab 8, and while it was pretty good (except for poor battery life), I think this game is an absolute must-have for anyone with a Galaxy Note 4. The screen makes the graphics look really bright and vibrant, battery life is excellent, and the load times are instantaneous. The interface is a little small on the Note 4's screen, but the stylus (especially with the hover cursor on) dramatically improves the experience, making precision clicking a breeze. This is rapidly becoming the game I have invested the most hours into on a mobile device. There's a couple of awkward interface choices that were clearly made as a concession to having the touch interface and a lack of keyboard, but overall it plays exceptionally well. I've only experienced one crash while playing when loading a new area, but it wasn't too far past an auto-save, still hit that quick-save button often! A note to Beamdog... Any chance of using the S Pen hover for tooltips? Also: PLEASE release Baldur's Gate II: EE!! I will buy it the day it comes out!!",5,1,1.3,2014-12-01 15:16:12,,

I foolishly assumed that it went to the next character's backpack, and upon returning to the town, nobody in my party had the quest items, they had not been dropped, just vanished...attach BT keyboard, mod ini file and bring up console (CTRL+Enter) to add the missing items if this happens to you (lists all over the place online of console commands and item codes).

This is usually easily fixed by zooming in however, and I gladly do so to keep the authenticity of this fantastic game. I'm very surprised how faithful this port is. Keep up the good work!

Everything is just so intuitive that it almost seems like it was created just to play on a tablet. It was pretty smooth even on my Nexus 7 (2012).

Everything becomes quite clear and the bugs can be (mostly) avoided if you have already read through the ""how to play"" sections of the manual if you can find it on-line. Bugs include failure to trigger tutorial progress if resting is selected when the spell book is visible,  missing description of the spell button you are told to use, and a few other less critical issues like a phantom text box briefly appearing every time new dialogue is initiated.  Dialogue and all options also stalled at the ""final test"" stage of the tutorial with no option to progress, forcing the tutorial to be abandoned.  Game play was on a 2012 Galaxy Note 10.1.

Update: Quick suggestion Beamdog make the right panel on the HUD only way for selecting your characters not actually touching them on the map. This can make looting a bit more difficult bc you are trying to loot next to one of your characters and it selects the character instead. I can select my character on the HUD on right side so really no need for this feature. Just a minor annoyance so far in my game expericence but you guys did a perfect job really of bringing back a classic. I am going to buy all your IAPs when I get around to it for keeping them at a minimum and giving us the complete core experience without needing them. They seem to actually be some IAPs that will enrich the experience. I cannot express my grattitude enough that you guys gave us the complete game and expansions for one price no IAPs needed.

It's got a great story, interesting characters and tons of scope for different playing styles leading to lots of replayability!  I play this mainly on my 2012 Nexus 7 and performance wise it's seamless, the only slight niggle is that hitting the exact area on the screen to open chests or travel through doors can be a bit fiddly, but only when zoomed right out (it gets a bit blocky when zoomed in).

Other than for that I would have given 5 stars hands down.",4,6,1.3,2014-04-18 09:47:45,,

Some of the AD&D 2nd edition rules may seem a little dated, but the pre-rendered graphics are still pretty good looking for a game that is 15 years old.  Make no mistake, this is a HARD game.  It is NOT a casual game. Save often and be prepared to die.  A lot. Also, don't try to do EVERYTHING. Play the character you create and enjoy the story.",5,6,,2014-04-16 18:15:39,,
