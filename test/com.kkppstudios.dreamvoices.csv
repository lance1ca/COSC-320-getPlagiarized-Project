This app is near perfect. I have my own nitpicks because i am using it to capture sounds in the night as opposed to speaking. It's still pretty good, but it could use some enhancements. In any case, app is well worth the cost. If you are trying to record night sounds and want an app dedicated to just that, this is does it well.",4,0,2.3.3,2021-02-08 06:22:45,,

I was able to record my dream in the middle of the night without touching my phone. It even works well with white noise in the background, unlike many other apps. You just have to get the sensitivity set right. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.",5,3,2.3.3,2021-01-31 07:49:38,This is a 5 star review!

The swipe control should soon have a threshold setting that will make it easier to play recordings without triggering the swipe. I will get that updated as soon as it's released.

Thanks for taking the time to write this feedback. I agree, if I could change the swipe threshold I would adjust that. Without getting into too much of the technicals I am limited by the Xamarin Forms toolset, in this case their SwipeView control. It is logged as a bug request in their list. I hope to fix that soon.

Don't waste your time or money,1,1,2.2.0,2021-01-11 03:24:02,"Hi Gemelli! This ended up being an issue specific to LG phones. It's fixed in the latest update. Try it out.
