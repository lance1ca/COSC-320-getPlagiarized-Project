The Story is actually great, but for the price i think it's not worth it. Like come on, square are just making lazy port of an old game and charge you with a mad price tag for a mobile title, if i would recommend any other square mobile title, i would say TWEWY is a thousand time more worth it than this game. Square should add some features like the quest menu so you can actually know what to do and where to go, but i think hey this is Square Enix right? they had abandon this mobile port a long time ago.

Golbez an underrated villain. Visuals are strong, though I prefer the original SNES graphics, and the addition of 3D cut-scenes and voices seems unnecessary, but I'm admittedly biased by my nostalgia. No major control problems, but the camera seemed slightly too zoomed in for interior areas. Drop rates are unbelievably low for rare items near the end (will those flan princesses ever give me a pink tail?), encounter rates are high, and the game should do a better job of explaining the abilities system (many abilities are only received if other abilities are distributed in a specific way, and repercussions of poor ability distribution can extend even to 2nd and 3rd playthroughs, though this is not made clear to the player), but it's all very much worth it.

The only gripe I had was it is a bit more difficult to play a console-grade game on a smartphone screen for long stretches of time without having to take more frequent breaks to rest my arms and hands (Galaxy S7 Edge user here.) Gamepad support in the future would help alleviate this issue for people craving a marathon gaming experience. Screen mirroring to a TV makes for a more immersive console-like cutscene and dialogue experience, but the input lag to TV makes actual gameplay this way impractical. All in all, this is a solid app worth every penny (or gil?) that delivers a genuine Final Fantasy experience wherever you happen to be.",5,2,1.5.5,2017-11-01 23:41:57,,

It's very easy to accidentally walk in the wrong direction and in the case of battles the menus will cover up the whole screen which makes you feel fairly disconnected from the action. This particular version also restores a couple features from the Japanese DS remake, such as different menu themes and text speed options, but it also removed Rydia's new summon and all minigames associated with it despite being extremely easy to port in the first place. Another thing that's notable is that the character models feel a lot stiffer than on the DS because their ""breathing"" is much more subtle than before.  There is still a good game hidden underneath these flaws, though. Just put a little more effort into the porting job next time around.",3,4,1.5.5,2017-06-09 07:54:18,,

Use the stylized font used on the DS. It looks far better. But second, and most importantly, the CONTROLS. Holy cow. Who okayed this? The direction pad on the world map is just stupid. It's so awkward. Just put a transparent, fixed D-pad on the lower left. It's so much more intuitive than this odd scheme that had me walking in every direction but the one I wanted. And the touch screen menu sucks. It's slow to use and it distracts from the onscreen action. And why can't I see my character stats when menus are open.

Story: The story was fun and exciting. Enough so to keep me playing through it 2 more times after I beat it the first. It was awesome watching some of the characters develop, including the antagonist from the beginning. After the credits roll, I felt happy that I was able to experience a story like this. Controls: the controls definitely take some time to get used to. The best part is being able to put your finger anywhere to start moving. In battles it's not super smooth with what you try to press, but you can usually work with it. Sometimes you will try to scroll down or try to select a different hero and accidentally use a command. Graphics: graphically, there were no issues running on my Droid Turbo. The game ran really well with no fps lag or skews and on top of that, it looked really pretty compared to the old SNES version in my opinion.  Final notes:  There were a lot of things I liked about this game. Including the difficult optional bosses and even the optional dungeons that made me play even longer. I liked the cutscenes and voices for the characters as well. It really helped to make the story feel more alive.  Overall: This game was a fantastic play.

Final Fantasy 4 has always been my favorite Final Fantasy of all time next to FF6. The reviews looked fine so I said it was a no brainer. The controls are a real nightmare. It's really hard for example to get to a chest on the first try. The game was designed for the DS (that has a dual screen) and it shows in this port. The menus are horrible and the overhead map appears on top of the game play area. I tried to get a refund after about 20 min of game play but 5 days after purchasing the game. I was told they only refund if there is a bug. So if you are thinking about buying this game I suggest you really think about it or make sure you can play enough in the first two days to try it out and still have the option to get the refund from Google play store. You'll probably need it.,1,0,,2017-01-20 16:52:41,,

My issues are mainly technical. The performance lags a bit at times, even on a high end tablet, making battles feel sluggish. Not great for a game with as many random battles as this one. My other main complaint is that the game will black screen whenever you tab out for any reason, requiring a force close and leading to lost progress. This even happens sometimes just from letting the screen time out for too long. Totally unacceptable for a mobile port.

I'd heard that this game had a fantastic story, but as I sit here having gone through the first 3 ""chapters"", so to speak, I'm finding that the story would have been enticing if it was the first non-fairy tale story I'd read in elementary school.  This leads me to believe that the people who are rating this game highly are viewing the game through rose-tinted glasses, which I'm sure I've been guilty of as well with games like Final Fantasy VI.  Story aside, I'm finding the GUI to be awfully far from optimized.  It takes far too many touches to get through a menu command, and the battles are tedious on a touchscreen (in addition to already being tedious, being a JRPG).  However, it looks like a lot of effort went into the graphics, and I think they look great, relatively speaking.  I'm still debating giving up on this game, though.",2,1,1.3.1,2015-01-04 12:16:39,,

The augment system is a great addition to the battle system which makes combat play differently and allows for some slight customization.   I'm playing this on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Runs fine for the most part but I did come across some frame rate drops in towns and the last cavern. Most are tolerable.",4,0,1.2.6,2013-10-25 17:29:29,,

The same great story line I loved as a kid has now been vastly improved with amazing graphics, great audio and controls, and even voice acting in select event scenes. The $16 price tag may be a bit to swallow for an Android game but the great game play and nostalgic feeling associated with the game, if you have played any of the previous versions, are well worth the purchase. The voice acting can be a bit crummy at times, and the random battles can be slightly draining and time consuming, but those complaints shouldn't even be a factor in considering this game.

It works flawlessly on my Sony Xperia S (LT26i).  I particularly am a fan because I'm only used to the American SNES version, so it's nice to finally play a version that more resembles the Japanese version (different items, names of spells, extra tidbits, etc.).  Another nice feature is the ability to choose normal or hard when you start a game for the first time.  This should not be confused with the SNES vs. Super Famicom differences.  This only changes the difficulty of the enemies, which I gladly chose hard to make it more challenging, and it's DEFINITELY challenging!

On my Samsung Galaxy Note II, it runs perfectly.  The graphics are simple yet totally clean, with no detail left out.  Also has a widescreen option for the big boys.  The cutscenes have voiceover and updated dialog, improving character development and making for a more engaging storyline that already starts out with a lot of twist and turns.  In respect to the original, it is basically a map by map remake so far (I have only been playing for several hours).  The story also follows the original identically.  If it stays that way, you are looking at many hours of gameplay, with many towns, dungeons, and worlds to explore.
