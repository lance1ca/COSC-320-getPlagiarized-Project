I have one request - Even though you don't want to scare people off with Kanji at the beginning, I think people will not bother seeing it as long as it comes with Furigana and you can tell them not to bother with Kanji unless they obses with it (like me). For me I love to see Japanese sentence with Kanji. It's beautiful to see three of them together in one sentences.  I take serious of every example sentences you provide. I hear it, mimic it and write it. Whenever I will have finished Human Japanese Intermediate, Ill back to the start and Ill  be happy to see Kanji and it's time to be serious with them.  HOPE YOU CONSIDER THIS TO INGREDIENTS - NEED MORE KANJI. Thanks",5,6,1.1.1,2015-05-24 11:37:12,,
