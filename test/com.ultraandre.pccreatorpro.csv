I want boss (the creator of the game) should always listen to suggestions in discord chat and also the bugs report chat in order to make the game better. I giving it a 3 stars is actually because of the lottery. since it is ads free, it harder to grind with lottery, so they should add missions for that Lastly,hope this game can have more popularity",3,4,1.9.5,2020-08-31 11:18:07,"Good afternoon.

Paying $3.45 for this app was a mistake, refunded. It is a really good idea, however , I feel it was too much for what was included, instead of adding almst only 3D, try adding unique features to this ""Pro"" version, make it deserve the pro name. One better name at this time would be PC Creator 3D. Try adding loans, advertising, adding a wiring stage of building.
