You can have all your information available on the device offline and not in the cloud (which is a great plus). You can test drive this with the free desktop version which is exactly the same as you get in this app. Great features overall, however it's a bit slow. It lacks the ease and simplicity of adding thoughts, links, etc. that TheBrain offers.",3,2,2.2,2015-05-02 09:56:21,"The user interface does support pinch zoom for the diagram and has support for mouse and touch devices. If you move the mouse over an item, a tooltip pops up and a click on the item centers it in the diagram. On a touch device, a tap on the item shows the tooltip and a second tap centers the item. A new version with better performance is on the way",2015-05-02 00:47:32
