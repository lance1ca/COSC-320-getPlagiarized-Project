your phone? Have to reset data or reinstall app? You start over from 
scratch. You get a new friend code that you have to resend to all your 
friends that are pissed off that they can't finish the orphaned games that 
have been going for a week or so. They have this ""device link"" feature that 
should allow you to transfer, but evidently it changes periodically. (I 
just had to reset my phone and the code I saved a month or so ago was 
evidently ""expired"") Again, RftG is great. The decent gameplay of this app
