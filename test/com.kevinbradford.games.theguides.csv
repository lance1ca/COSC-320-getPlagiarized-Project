There was literally almost no challenge. The seventh was less of a riddle, as far as I could tell, and more of an exercise in brute force.I did not see the answer immediately, or rather, I saw a list of all possible answers, and went through testing each condition to solution. Neither of these options are particularly stimulating or fun though. Maybe it will get better.    played to 1/12 where I got a run time error.  on 1/10. I put my right answer in several times,  and it would not take it. So i rebooted, and reloaded the game, whereby it then took my right answer, and let me proceed. At this point, it wasn't fun anymore. I tried to get my $$$ back. But thats not happening. I got this game because I thought it would be challenging, not for runtime errors and reboots. Though this  mess of cryptic & enigmatic crap is less intriguing than  I had hoped.

At first I didn't like how there was no instructions or tutorial, it just starts but now I think that's exactly what I enjoy most about it.
