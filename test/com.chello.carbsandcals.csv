Previously I only used free apps and am used to them having blips etc but assumed that was because they were free.  From this it seems paid ones are no more reliable or professional.  The 'download all pictures' option only seems to download 1/3 of pics despite there being plenty of space on my phone and card.  This means eating out in areas of poor signal you spend so much time waiting for photos to download to gauge your portion size that the meal is cold before you get to eat it!  It also eats your data usage, and battery life.  My phone won't last a full day without charging now if used at every mealtime - nothing worse than thinking you have the tool in your handbag but when you get your meal out you can't use tool as either no battery or signal!  The variety of meals/foods I thought would be larger than the DAFNE app but I still find it lacking and can only work out half of my meals from it - and I don't eat unusual things!
