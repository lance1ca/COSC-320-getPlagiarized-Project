After you pay, you get to enjoy an in game advertisement at start up.  Not only that, but you can get ""reinforcements"" by paying for them.  This is the first game I've seen where you have to pay to play, get advertisements, and have to make in game purchases to win.  There is literally a level where you lose the first turn unless you purchase reinforcements.  Get real.  I see that the developers comment every time someone complains about the in app purchases, saying they are there to make it easier, but in some cases, they are there just to make the game winnable.  Also, it freezes up about every minute.  The freezes last anywhere from 15 seconds to 2 minutes.  If it happens to freeze while the AI is doing their turn, you might as well just restart your phone.  What a joke; I won't buy anything from these developers ever again.",1,8,1.0.7,2014-08-24 12:53:36,"Thank you for your feedback Joseph.

War strategy games are hard to come by for Android and well-made games like this, less so.  They amped up the challenge a bit in this sequel.  That's not always a bad thing but at a certain point here I think they went too far-- specifically the scenario from the World War III campaign where you as the Soviets have to take Chicago & Detroit.  I tried several times before finally giving up, but you just have too few troops and too little time to work with.  I know others say they've won on all the maps without purchasing additional resources, but I just don't see how.  I'd love for someone to prove me wrong in a walkthrough.  I much prefer the model of paying more for a game up front and having more permanent balance of difficulty over this one where you need to buy resources to get some temporary balance.  In the latter, I refuse to essentially throw money out the window-- especially given how I like to replay scenarios.  So to sum up, the game is really well executed in most ways, but suffers from the model..  Would love to give it 5 stars but have to go with 3.",3,1,1.0.3,2014-03-23 15:30:23,"Thank you, Shayne!
