Even with all the magic the book is incredibly real in emotions and desires. Each character is carefully constructed: its almost like the character that the player creates isn't the main character of the book. As an app, it functions perfectly. As a story, very well planned, consistent, in depth, fun, etc. Incredibly excited for the next book. My only inquiry is whether or not there is a way to delete saved game files?

Considering she used to be an assassin, carelessly butchered Daisuke, and gave readily into a forbidden manslaying technique in order to casually slaughter at least a dozen people and a demon, this feels significantly out of character for her.   Additionally, she hasn't gotten around to much man (or demon) slaying as of late, despite clearly having had the urge since book 2.   Finally, the choices feel arbitrary and frequently penalize you for casual conversation choices that seem like they should be in-line with your personality, while the text-based deduction / observation system has prompted me, as an achievement hound and completionist, to restart the game on numerous occasions, which makes it insanely frustrating to play through.

Let the readers, who've gone through the detective work on a previous play, skip its Q and A sections for a more streamlined narrative which is already there.

I love their style and accuracy to culture. The story is long, intriguing, and captivating. The only reason I give 4/5 stars is this third book, while an amazing piece of art, had little to no real choice. It was a great read but the only thing I really influenced was attunement. If I chose an option that suited the character I created but it wasn't the choice the author intended, attunement decreased and it did the whole ""wait no, that option didn't make sense so -main character- did this instead"". A wonderful read and I do look forward to #4, but don't they and misrepresent it as an actual ""make your own story"" type.",4,9,1.0.2,2018-02-16 20:48:15,,

The first is that the second half of the book, although well written and a great story, felt very much like a 'choose' the correct answer and less choose your own adventure. Even then, it was choose the answer that causes the least amount of damage to your stat bars because the story is going this direction whether like it or not.  The second thing I didn't like ties into the first a bit... But the MC seems to have a sudden behavioural change in the last half of the book.

Your charge suddenly is gone to the wind, your whole beginning, and you barely interacted with her in the first place, and now your character is suddenly on a path to mindlessness.

One major complaint I have is with the Japanese scattered randomly throughout the game. The characters often say words that are sporadically replaced with their rough Japanese translation, which I feel is highly unnecessary. Also, the Japanese translations are wrong quite a few times, such as ""General"" translating directly to ""common"" in Japanese instead of the military title. I feel that if you're going to price this title at such a high price compared to others, the least you can do is hire a translator to look over your story instead of relying on Google Translate.

When i saw that the full game needs to be purchased (SoH 1) after installing, i almost gave up. Fortunately, i decided to try out the free chapters that the game offers and let me tell you, it was the best decision i ever made. I just couldn't stop reading the story! I bought the full game just after finishing the free chapters and oh boy was i obsessed with the game. I straight up bought the second game and now the third without thinking or looking at the comments. SoH Book 3, for me is by far the  best book. It feels far more lengthier (the good kind) than the previous books and how i love the character developments in this book. It even made me care for the characters that are just being introduced in this book. Now that i finished the book, i got this sort of empty feeling inside.

I understand why it's there, I just don't like it :&lt;. Otherwise, i love how we get some character development across the board; we get to murder some demons, we get to have friends murdered, and we get some more romance options. I like the ending a lot more than the ending of book 2, the arc rounded up nicely, and it feels less cliff hanger-y, while still giving us an idea of what's coming. Taking control away from the player and reading about the MC through the eyes of a different narrator was a gamble, but I think it worked, and would love to see more of that in the future(maybe with alignment flair?) I would have liked more Jun(ko) interaction, but I'm guessing that's been saved for the next book.",5,11,1.0.1,2017-12-03 14:15:44,,
