Everyday after daycare he comes home and begs to use our tablet to play Alphabet Aquarium.   My wife and I always say yes because the games are quite educational. Not only are the games educational, but they keep him quite for an hour or so each night. This could not be more of a blessing. The kid typically is bouncing off the walls.   Also, we recently met with his day care instructor. The day care is somewhat of a preschool for three years olds as well. She said that the last few months he has really began to get ahead of the class, especially with his reading abilities and alphabet. We grabbed Letter Quiz: Alphabet Aquarium a few months back. This was not a coincidence; this app does help kids learn. If you have a toddler, I highly recommend Letter Quiz: Alphabet Aquarium.",5,29,1.22,2013-12-31 14:30:56,,

Thankfully I have a bunch of apps on my phone that I got specifically to prevent this from happening. This app if by far one of the coolest ones I have. This app will allow a kid to learn the alphabet in a fun and interactive way. The app is very cool and you'll see how well it works when your kids are saying the alphabet soon after playing around with this app.  Overall, Great app with a great interface and content. Fun and educational is what this app is.",5,2,1.2,2013-09-15 08:28:04,,

I finally found one. It takes lot of time for me to teach my son about letters. This application made that teaching much simpler. Saved me so much time! And my son loves to sing the alphabet song within the app. Also, it is great that there are multiple objects for each letter, so it enhanced my son's vocabulary as his native language is not English.",5,3,1.2,2013-09-14 13:01:47,,

This game seems great and may just be the edge he needs for this fair shot. He seems to have been kept rather focused and interested on playing the game educational or not he does have a fairly short attention span always looking for the next thing to do but when it comes to certain things he manages not to get bored and so far this seems like one of the things.,5,3,1.2,2013-09-10 18:36:36,,
