The game itself is beautiful and pleasure to simply look at. The core game play is fairly simple. You are on a road and need to pick where you want to go in order to gain certain points. There are multiple win objectives so the trick is to focus on your own objective while making it more difficult for the other players. The last person in line keeps taking a turn until there is a new last person in line. This is then repeated until the road ends and the points are tallied.

The downsides are few but significant and one might think that the fixes  areboth common sense and easy.   The view is so zoomed out that otherwise lovely visuals are postage-stamp-inscrutable. You can manually pinch-zoom but only a tiny bit and it resets almost immediately. A deeper zoom that can stick would improve the visual experience two-fold.  The bottom bar which maps the current stretch of road is useful but there is no such feature for the other sections, making it inconvenient-verging-on-impossible to strategize as one might in the actual or desktop version of the game. It really hurts the replay value of the game.   At certain critical points, the player is unable to view rival players' stats or locations on the board. This, too, really diminishes how deeply the game can be appreciated.   The game also requires two deliberately-timed taps on the 'ok' button to end one's turn. Unlike a game such as Catan, there is no reason a turn should not end automatically, particularly when fast AI is turned on. The lack of a true fast play option, again, really impacts replayability.  Overall, the game is enjoyable but frustrating; it plays like a half-heated port of a truly brilliant game.

Tokaido is what I would consider a modern classic. The game play is simple and exciting. The art has a way of being subtle but still eye-catching. That combined with the relaxing ambiance of the soundtrack helps make the game immersive. Still the game isn't perfect. There is a small bug when you leave the app for anything that it shuts it down and makes you restart the day you were currently playing. The online play has never connected for me. Still the pass and play option is a good alternative. An option to play the game backwards would greatly increase the playability of this game. I am also waiting for the expansion. Though it false short; this app is a must and a wonderful alternative to those who can't get their fix with the board game.,3,5,1.10.03,2018-02-16 06:07:51,,

thanks for your feedback.
About the lag before your turn, it's caused by auto save every time before your turn, but we're thinking to add a save button in Settings to avoid that, it can be long and annoying in some devices.

The game has a Zen like feel that is great when I have 5 minutes to spare. Yes games take about 5 minutes to play and that may be why I like it for my phone. In fact most board games don't get me on the phone because 30+ minutes in a few play sessions or all at once when I'm alone is a tough ask. This game feels like a quick immersion into a vacation without the huge expense of one.  Having AI opponents is great, though I'd like difficulty options (as the AI doesn't always take the best scoring move and feel fairly easy to beat). Not sure how to implement a difficulty setting in a leap frog game though, but maybe the expansions would change that. The music is good for the game, but not quite memorable enough to start humming the tune in public.

I contacted them regarding a bug I have been experiencing that made the game unplayable  since the last update and demanded a refund but they still haven't answered my mail. The game adaption is good in theory but can be improved concerning some bugs. I only had the chance to play this game about seven times so far and experienced some bugs that made me start all over again. Otherwise I really like the game and wished the app would work properly. Update: I contacted Google and they said that they are unable to to do anything and I should contact the developer. They only want my money and offer no service. Besides I once had a similar situation in which I had requested a refund from the developer for an app and it was no problem for that developer to return my money.,2,1,1.0,2017-03-31 06:17:10,"Hello Catharina,
