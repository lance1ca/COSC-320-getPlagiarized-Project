Some seem to get broken and I have to manually fix them, like Kindle recently, but I think that's Amazon's fault. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is the few that still haven't been done despite multiple requests and buying several of his icon packs. I'd donate to get a few done.",4,7,3.2.7,2020-11-17 17:06:59,,

I already have your Lines - Flat on my phone. I love that. But this one......it's so pretty! I love it! Especially good for when I have a lighter coloured wallpaper (often changing it) so I can see the icons clearer. Thank you!

In my opinion it looks great with a nice ""outrun"" background. I use a background with lots of black so that my OLED display can shine and to reduce battery.
