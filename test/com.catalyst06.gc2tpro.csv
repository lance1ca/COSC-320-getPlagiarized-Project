Root access is required by this app to allow touch emulation, and it was well worth the effort of ""rooting"" my Android. ""GC2 Touch"" was set up and working instantly, boasts a clean, clear English user interface, offers easily customisable button and joystick positioning on-screen and an amazing combination of custom macro and multi-input options for buttons, joysticks and triggers. Does NOT block ""Google Play Services"" (like ""Octopus"" does), and does not require the game to be launched via this app. Rather, ""GC2 Touch"" sets your custom input profile as an invisible overlay over the screen, meaning it will manifest the input you've assigned no matter what app is running. This does not interrupt normal touch input in any way, meaning that while an input profile is active you can simultaneously use your phone's touchscreen with your fingers as usual without any problems.

My advise on how to improve this software, this software is very expensive despite many bugs and glitchy so dev should take a look:  -fix the analog stick relative touch emulation to improve first person shooter aiming/controls, currently it is very glitchy/buggy  -let user can enable more than two buttons emulation for example 2 'Y' or 3 'R1' touch emulation on screen instead of message popup saying ""Button is already present on-screen!!""  -theres a bug when if you edit your touch profile and then saved it, you have to switch your ""GC2TouchPro"" IME to other IME then switch it back to ""GC2TouchPro"" in order to make effect to the profile that you just edited and saved. Pls fix this! Its such a hassle!  My final review on Game Controller 2 Touch Pro:  Works fine as what it is. Dont rely on this software to play shooting games as the analog stick mechanics is glitchy, very unreliable. But if you want to play fighting games or side-scrolling platformer games, the touch emulation works fine. Overall i dont think its worth for its price as it is far from perfect.
