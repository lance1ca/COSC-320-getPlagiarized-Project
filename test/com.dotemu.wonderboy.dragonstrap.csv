The game play and levels , being updated , play the same as it did before and the remastered version is wonderfully reproduced with modern visuals, its a great game and will spend hours playing it to find all those areas, my only concern is the controls being a bit laggy or not 100% correct, this is when trying to do jump attacks or jumping to platforms. on a android it can be a bit hard to pull off. would have been nice if they added more areas to find and expanded the original as its a bit short. overal a great game , and would recomend. 4/5",4,8,1.1.0,2020-10-17 02:18:08,,
