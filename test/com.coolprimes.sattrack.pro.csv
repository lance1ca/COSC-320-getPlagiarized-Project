Only bit I don't understand is in the individual radio view, what do the moving yellow and green dots mean on the red circle? Ah! Can't believe I didn't get that! I'll test it on the next decent ISS pass in a couple if hours. 73",4,0,1.15-pro,2021-01-15 11:31:42,"Thank you! The dots can help you your phone directly at the satellite in real time, for portable operation. I have a mount for my phone on my Arrow antenna. The yellow dot is in the center when the elevation is correct. When the red dot is at the top of the circle the azimuth is correct and your phone is pointed directly at the satellite. 73, W1ANT",2021-01-15 08:46:13

If there was a way to input custom orbital elements for tracking other stuff it would be perfect but with that being said this is probably the best amsat app on Google play.",5,2,1.15-pro,2020-06-27 23:02:46,,
