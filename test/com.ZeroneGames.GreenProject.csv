I don't usually find games that I will play for long durations. I have been with this game. There is a small little tutorial book included in the game but much of it is exploration and figuring things out yourself. Save often and maybe even have a couple of save files.

I hope for the next update they could add settings to change position if the movement button to their desired position. And I've noticed that I cannot put coffee to seed machine to make seeds.
