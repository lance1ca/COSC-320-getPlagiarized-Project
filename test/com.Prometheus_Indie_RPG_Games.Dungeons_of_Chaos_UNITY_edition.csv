story, although it has it's moments, but what it has is incredible tactical 
depth and replayability, more than any other game I have played, and I have 
played hundreds of games over my 35 years of gaming. I have spent over 1500 
hours on this and played it through too numerous times to count (I stopped 
counting at 20:th playthrough), and it is still managing to give 
entertainment to me, even after all this time with it. The game is strongly 
based on replayability (and designed to be replayed) and discovering it's 
nuances, and you will only scratch the surface if you are just going to 
play it through once. The class system is plain incredible with unparalled 
depth and has numerous viable combinations. The classes are NOT designed to 
be balanced, but to be valued in a complete team. The developer has worked 
on the game for an incredibly long time, and still constantly adds new 
things. He is also the friendliest developer around and usually replies 
very quickly to any and all questions on the game's Facebook pages. Maybe 
the most icredible thing about all this is, that developing games is his 
hobby! I would place this game right by Baldur's Gate 2 in quality and 
replayability, and it bypasses all Ultima games by miles. It would easily 
be worth 30‚Ç¨ or more. For me that would be a mere 2 cents per hour, which

One thing I really want to show gratitute towards is the classic way the game handles dialogue. I like how it isn't a chore to go around talking to the npcs because you can actually ask questions you want to ask (provided that it's in the lore of the game). A big part of role playing games in my opinion is dialogue options and that's something modern games are missing. There's been so many times in say, skyrim where I get to a new town and all I want to do is ask a gaurd where the closest inn is, or if they know anything about a quest I'm doing.  Why not have a sort of vocabulary system in games where you learn more about the world and get to ask questions about it? - much like a classic rpg. Much like your game.  It's a small detail that I really appreciate.  On top of it being easier to give a reason for the player to explore it also adds the immersion of  'Role playing'. My only complaint thus far is that a lot of the tap gestures can be a little rough on my fat fingers against my tiny phone.  Also the combat can be a little over whelming at first - but that's expected.  It is, after all, a classic rpg. Good job! I'll write an updated review when I get a better chance to play it.",5,3,1.9.760,2017-12-18 09:33:06,Thanks !,2017-07-22 14:04:44

They are useful against undead and can heal somewhat, but they really aren't viable in combat. Hp too low, no armor and evade isn't reliable enough.

The game is a mix between dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. That alone should sell you on the $5 game price. It's fun to play for casual play like whipping your phone out and grinding some experience. It's also challenging enough that I had to spend some time actually looking and trying to use my head. It's worth the download. Don't let the price scare you. I've dropped maybe 40 hours into the game so far. Not even done yet. Recommended to a friend after him seeing me play it after three separate hang outs. Games like this are something special and rare to find in today's market. Thank you to the developers for what you created. I am that boy again with a tinfoil Helmet and a cardboard sword.

Detailed fight analysis after every battle lets obsessive min-maxers tailor each character to their strengths and the whole party for max damage to different foes.  Loved the game, my only quibbles are the very end, it forces a save right at the start of the climactic battle, and if you win, the game is over. No going back to keep buffing your characters, complete unfinished quests & achievements or explore more dungeons.  No fleeing either. You literally have to reload, and then commit suicide in the final battle if you want to keep playing. Also, there are monsters waaay harder to beat than the final bosses. When I finished, it seemed like there was a lot of extra room for better loot, higher spells, more levels that I never even got to. Replay value, I guess. Also, there are NO and I mean NO hints, tips, cheats, or walkthroughs anywhere outside the developer's own wordpress page. Very stable app. Crashed only once in about 100 hours of play.

Lots of pointless walking at this point... 80% of the gear sold in shops is junk. Anything useful is unrealistically expensive. The game is also unstable- not only did I have to save often, I had to save and then also backup the save file often because my first playthrough file became corrupt after I completed the guild quest for berserkers...

Orc warlords are in the most western (sorry, said eastern before) Orc hut and the one south of that. Their boss room contains a flew all though so you may need to have good perception and/or 'wizards eye' spell active when walking past, to spot it.",2016-09-11 00:52:10

I just wanted to ask that if at all possible, is there anyway to make the chars/char classes more unique from one another. It would be great if there were a bit more of the character creation when it comes to the skills/spells. For example, the wizard is an elemental along with the geomancer, but they share the same spells, there for the only difference is title, appearance, and story. This is something that I, myself would love to see.",5,0,1.5.70,2016-09-03 19:25:08,"Thanks! Please spread the word ... 8^)

There is some uniqueness at present , but other fans are requesting the opposite: ability/hacks to let a mage do heal spells etc.  So there is some balancing act here.  Currently, holy chant and exorcise is for clerics and monks only (powerful) for example. Insignia boosts are different, item restrictions etc",2016-09-04 15:40:05

Face enemies you can't defeat knowing it will take 40+ hours of continous play to get to a level where you can try. Or find doors you can't open until later.
