So I was lvl 9 on first island, and second became lvl 8... It's quite sad tbh, since grinding is pointless and technically I can get stuck(if I grind to higher level, but my items stay at their respective level(wood/iron, some rare diamond), then I could probably not make it.) I wish there was a ""main story"" and island levels were based on that. Perhaps 2 game modes(story mode vs endless(current mode seems to be endless, I could be wrong tho)) Played first version few years back. Seeing that the dev updated the old one and made the second, I bought it without even trying out the demo. Price is good, game is definitely worth it. Got a weird issue tho, game setting by default have English language, but the game menu appears to be auto translated to my local language used on the device. I had to switch to different one(e.x. Spanish) which restarted the game, then change it back to English and after restart the game runs in English.",5,2,1.0.4227,2020-06-25 13:18:22,"Thanks for your super feedback!!

I bought it and was at first frustrated because I kept dying and I didn't know why, but then I figured out why I was dying, and after I had, the game forced me to strategize, having to go back to the bar and sometimes the inn once inn a while (get it?) which was a nice break from the usual rogue-like senseless killing. thanks for this game, and keep up the awesome work!",5,3,0.2.2407,2019-10-02 01:05:18,"Hahaha thanks for your review, inn my opinion, one of the most fun I've read :D Thanks!!!",2019-10-02 02:27:27

After clicking the restart button it took me to title screen, but slot 1 says 'continue'. Clicking this causesthe game to hang in a neverwnding load cycle.

I can't sing enough praises about this sequel, which gives the original a fresh coat of paint, and more! As stated in a previous review, this works well with talkback, and the memorization of the symbols and their meanings is a non-issue for me. I'm really happy to see that I'm not the only one to hold this game in high regards. Keep it up! :)",5,2,0.2.2407,2019-10-01 08:40:28,"Thanks a lot for your very nice review, I really am glad you enjoy the game and that you appreciate it being able to work with google talkback :) I hope you play a lot and keep having fun with it :D Good luck!",2019-10-01 14:59:00
