I certainly had no problem with the image being upside down in SteamVR, but if it was, there seemed to be options for that. the program fully explains itself, just by holding the mouse pointer over anything for a second or two... I already had a decent droid phone ( Motorola E6), and two seprate sets of goggle, EvoVR, and a Tzumi Dream360. Each was about $20 at Walmart, - both super cheap. I tried out your 'Lite' version, my only disappointment was the 10-minute limit per use. So the very next day I bought a giftcard for GooglePlayStore, and bought it up. Again, super cheap to buy. Im very happy with this product, sorry others aren't. Please keep up the good work in software development, you do certainly have talent at it. Good luck and thankyou.

I bought this so that I could show you further support in development. With the right features this will be the best way to experience VR from your PC with google cardboard.  I hope you can implement some of these features in the future:  Scaling - Right now my 5,5 inch OPO is a bit big and gives a very zoomed look, which limits fov and strains my eyes. If you could make it possible to scale the output on my screen so that I could have the render show up smaller, it would be of great help.  Save settings - I  often find settings that are very good for a particular game. If I could be able to save and load these that would be great.  Button bind for phone activation - Not sure if this is possible, but it's a real hassle to take off cardboard hmd to restart or try another setting. If I could bind it to a key that would be amazing.  I hope my purchase will drive you further into developing this amazing app! I'm so thankful that you're working on this",5,0,1.7,2014-11-22 11:36:25,"thanks for the support :) All the features you mention are already there, as shown in the instructions page. Specifically:
- TG Server lens calibration lets you move and scale the barrel distortion
- TG Server has load/save settings on the top menu
- TG Client has camera gesture so that you can start/stop 'swiping' your hand in front of the camera",2014-11-22 15:16:59
