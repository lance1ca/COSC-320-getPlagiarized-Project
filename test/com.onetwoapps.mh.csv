All functions perform as expected. The statistics screen is really well done. My only suggestion is creating a predicting algorithm feature that would take your average expenses over a set period of time and predict your future worth in a set future date. What i can tell the overview screen does this but only with reoccurring expenses/incomes. Anyways not a showstopper.

I have two pieces of feedback that I'd like to see in a future update:  1. I'd like to be able to label previous search filters into groups or categories such as weekly or pay cycle (fortnightly). At the. Kment labelling a search filters title actually affects the filter itself. I like to manage my expenses in weekly chunks or fortnightly chunks. So an easier way to swap between the default monthly view would be great.  2. I wish there was a way to toggle my budgets as expenses. As it stands this app is great for projecting income. But this projected income doesn't take into account your budget limit. For example. If I set a budget of 140 dollars for food, it would be a great to be able to toggle that budget so that the highest value (140) is inserted as a temporary  transaction.  This way, I could at a glance see how much money I'd make next month AS IF I would reach my budget allowance.   Other than these two things, the app is fantastic.

My Budget Book makes it possible to sort/ view/ plan/ manage your finances in pretty much any way you'd want.  There are of course apps which make an automatic real-time feed from various accounts possible, across all your devices,  which this one does not have.  What you get in return is the knowledge that some developer you don't know is not looking at (and selling) your financial data. So yes, there's some compromise in terms of ease, but the workaround for this is easy enough, and it takes me less than 2 minutes to get the same version of my finances on both my phone and tablet.   The app allows you to manipulate, search, plan in most/all ways you'd want to... and the developer is very responsive to any queries/ enhancement ideas you might have. I'm no financial dummy, but was too disorganised, and too overwhelmed at the prospect of getting organised. I could see immediately that this would help and it has done.

I've been looking to replace my financial software for several months.  I've been using Quicken for approx. 20 years.  It is only available on a Windows operating system.  My latest version of Quicken is 3 years old and will no longer download from the bank.  My Windows computer is getting older and I'm afraid it is going to die soon.  Conundrum - If I re-purchase the latest version of Quicken I will also very soon have to replace my computer.  The only thing I use my Windows machine for is that one piece of software.  Everything else I do is on Android - phone and tablet.  I've been downloading many, many of the other financial apps available for Android.  None have worked for my purposes as well as My Budget Book.  I like to set recurring transactions and be able to view my overall budget picture several months in advance.  There are several ""Forecasting"" apps out there, but they do not download from the bank.  There are also many apps which do download from the bank, but because they are ""real time"", they do not permit the forecasting option.    I downloaded My Budget Book about a week ago.

After some fiddling around with various apps, this app is the one closes to my wants and needs. As of now, I use it daily and it's one of my most used apps.  - Usability: The app is  lightweight and very responsive, it takes maybe a day of use do to the more basic UI interface, but it's intuitive enough for me. Also the widgets for fast entry of expenses is very handy.  - Safety & Privacy: YES, finally an budget app without cloud / server synchronization. Better yet, the network connection for the app is disabled so there is no chance for a MITM attack. For protection of the app itself, it's possible to set a long password for access, and every time your phone goes to sleep, it asks for it. Not sure about the actual encryption of the database itself, info could be included in the manual.    - Interface: Quite basic and simple, which makes it fast in use. It's maybe not the nicest or most fresh UI out there, but for me it's all I need.  - Else: Very fast response (<1 hour every question) from the developer and an extensive manual make me trust this app and developer. This app gets 5* and deserves your attention.",5,9,6.11,2016-04-29 13:02:20,"Thank you very much. Yes there is for security reasons no internet permission.

After downloading, trying and uninstalling 6 apps, I finally found this one, My Budget Book.  Before going through the time involved in inputting all my data again, I emailed the developer to check it was going to do what I needed it to do.  The answer came back the same day and with assurane that it would achieve what I wanted.    A couple of  helpful emails later, he had helped me setup the app exactly how I needed it and I have to say, it is far better than the previous one I had on my iPhone.  It is certainly worth the small amount charged for this app as it is very flexible.

You'll get a migraine trying to make sense of the reports. Structure is not intuitive even for simple tasks such as adding salary. For example, to add recurring salary you have to use something called ""standing order"". If you live in the U.S.  like me, then you have no idea what that is. I had to go on wikipedia to figure out its a ""recurring payment"". So you have to use Standing Orders to configure anything recurring, including transfers, revenues, and bill payments. What really had me pulling my hair out is that you cant see a list of what you create. Instead you have to look at the transaction reports to find what you created, but like I mentioned earlier, good luck with that. The final straw is how daily balance is presented. My whole purpose for getting this is to be able to predict how much money I will have on any specific day in the future to make wise spending decisions.  However it will only show you the debits and credits for a specific day but not the available balance on that specific day (look at the photos). And there are no help files whatsoever.

Initially it took a short bit to get used to where everything was and how it worked, but it was pretty quick to get used to. The app could use a 'help' or 'how-to' document so that users could get started and understand its use more quickly, but that's just a thought. I noticed a few things that could use improvement during my first few days of use and the Dev always responded to my emails within a few hours letting me know what he thought of my ideas and whether or not he was already incorporating them into an update. I am highly pleased with the app overall. I am still in search of something to mimic some of the concepts in Quicken or MS Money for my phone, which Is why I installed this app. It does lack a line-by-line running balance which would be highly useful. It really just shows, based on the debits and credits you enter, where you'll be for the overall month as a positive or negative balance. That is nice, but a monthly scale is a bit too broad because in the middle of the month you may dip near the negative on not be aware of it just looking at the 'Bank Statement' tab.
