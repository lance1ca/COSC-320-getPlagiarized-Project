The app is limited in that it can only scroll if you place your finger on the right hand side (where the actual scroll bar is) and then swiping up or down. Otherwise you get stuck in the middle of the passage if you just mindlessly swipe across the screen.   Other than that, this app is WONDERFUL and just as incredibly refreshing as the online version (so it's great to have the app when I don't have internet).
