As tantalizing as this app sounds, I cannot recommend it. You need to get the tablet communicating with the computer. I have an Android tablet and a Mac computer. The instructions are not available for this configuration, so you have to figure it out from the IOS devices. First, your Mac needs something called X11, which is not included in recent OSX installs. Need to find and install. Then install something called pd extended and figure out IP addresses. Then install TouchOSC bridge, then install TouchOSC editor, which won't work because I don't have java...   I don't see anything easy about ""easily connect to any MIDI capable application"". I've spent hours just to figure out the communication part. Save your money. I would request a refund from the play store, but 15 minutes is all they give you.",3,1,1.9.1,2013-12-26 13:30:09,,
