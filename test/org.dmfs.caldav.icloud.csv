After about a month of trying this-and-that, I was on be verge of giving-up, until I stumbled on this little app.  Holy cow, everything else was so complicated that I gave up (and they either didn't work, or only worked one direction).

I use each of them in my business and personal life. I already had iCloud syncing on everything but the Android S3. The key to getting SmoothSync working there was when I set an appointment (event/task) on the Android, in the window that opens when you start that, choose the right calendar, not the native Android calendar but the one that matches up to your email.Test it by going to one date and set an appt using one of the calendar choices you have and name the appt that email. Then go to another date and set an appointment using any other calendar or email and name the appt that calendar/email. Keep doing this with any calendars that show up in the calendar box. Then go back to the SmoothSync app and sync. Then go to your other devices and refresh the calendar and see which appt shows.
