I had read some reviews mentioning that the controls aren't great, but I could never have predicted just how truly awful they are. Four different control setups, and not even one that works even remotely well enough to do anything properly - how is it possible to mess up every control scheme so badly? The game should have been called 'Ghouls 'n Ghosts Immobile', given that you can barely move more than a few paces before the controls get you killed. As it is, the game is, without exaggeration, truly unplayable - even on casual mode - until a functional control scheme is added. Perhaps a floating virtual stick would help, or maybe taking cues from some other mobile game controls - there are plenty out there which get it right, after all.

Ghosts n Goblins was okay but it appears they've slowed it down. Runs like molasses. This port, however, runs at what appears to be very close to the arcade game speed. Controls are kind of hard to master but I think with time you can get it. Might work better with an actual game controller. Overall, pleasantly surprised by this port. Probably their best one. UPDATE: Okay, for some reason, it plays real slow now. It didn't the day I purchased it. What gives? This is running like molasses now. Downgraded to 3 stars now from 4 because of this.

It's arcade perfect.  Looks and sounds just like classic Ghouls N Ghosts but this game is too fast paced to deal with touch screen navigation. Ducking is separate from moving left and right which is the really achilles heel. The controls just aren't as responsive as they need to be.,4,58,1.00.00,2017-05-18 20:07:07,,
