That is most likely from offering players to the club. Every time you offer a player and a club does not make an offer it decreases your relationship with that club by a small amount. Over time these will eventually increase back to ""normal"".

believe that the game has so much potential and that can be achieved. Some 
ideas to the game would be: -being able to see other leagues from around 
the world and see the other clubs who are winning titles. -league tables 
with a point system like in real life because sometimes during the game you 
can see some teams go from 2nd to 10th. -game fixtures (example: Chelsea 4 
: 3 Arsenal ) to see how teams are doing. -Add some sort of Champions 
league or World Cup so that your clients can create attention 
internationally through good performances. -Goalkeepers never get 
cleansheats even if they are 99 rated which isn't realistic (no offense). 
-add a list of teams interested in signing your client to know which club 
you can offer your client to. -Strikers don't score many goals which makes 
it harder for them to develop. -Maybe add a team rating that can change 
throughout the years because sometimes there are really good teams that are 
relegated which seems kind of weird. -Lastly, please make the teams 
position in the league logical because once I loaned out half of my young 
prospects (all around 60 rated) to a 3rd league team and they got 
relegated!? ( which I thought made no sense). Anyways, even though I am

Players begin making a decision on retirement when then reach 35 with an increasing likely chance each year up to a max age of 40.
