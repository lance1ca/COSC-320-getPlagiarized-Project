Thank you very much for your interest in our apps  and for supporting us! üëç
The app works on ~13k devices so it would be hard to satisfy all Android users :), so we provide means to calibrate any device. It also works for new upcoming devices.
Yes, we have plans about angle improvements and will consider your suggestion.

Thank you for your interest and comment.
We have such app available on Google Play for measurements on pictures and with camera. 
Please check our Partometer app http://goo.gl/e6Goz7 for length, angle, area, circle  measurements and let us know if it's what you meant.

Thank you,
