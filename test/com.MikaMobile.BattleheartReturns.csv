Despite Mika Mobile having a complicated relationship with Android the fact is we, the Android gamers, love them and their games! In fact, most if not all of the love this game is getting is because of those previous games. Unfortunately, Battleheart 2 is Battleheart 1 but with somehow more boring grind, worse sense of progression, worse story and some new glitches. I loved Battleheart 1, I think everyone did, the only problem with it was the controls and lack of content after a while. I think it wasn't hard to do a better job this time around but somehow it actually feels worse? Just had to take Battleheart 1, improve the assets (which you did very well), add content and other stuff to do and, most importantly, improve the controls - the main and almost only problem with the first one. With all the grind and dumbed down stuff in Battleheart 2 the only difficulty you'll find in this game is the controls. You will rarely die because of a tough boss or because you messed up, 99% of the time characters die because of bad controls or control-related glitches - they are the real villain of this game and it's extremely frustrating. Controls aren't the only issue though. Overall it sort of feels like a dumb remake instead of a real sequel. The only thing I love about this game is the graphics, the rest is just meh or plain bad. I won't talk much about the multiplayer - it just doesn't make any sense to me. This is 2018. There's so much more that could have been done. In my opinion it should be cut off and all resources focused on the game itself. I really hope the devs improve this game and add a lot more content like unlockable characters, class specializations and more stuff to do or manage between all the same boring brainless grind, because as it is I can't really recommend it, the feeling isn't right. Otherwise what I imagine will happen is the game becoming F2P soon with some of the characters locked behind paywalls and premium users getting them unlocked or something, but the fact is the characters are not even that remotely interesting or unique as it is. Let's hope they do a better job in the future supporting and improving this game and for Battleheart Legacy 2's sake.",3,2,1.1.3,2018-12-07 00:07:15,,

I have enjoyed playing each one for countless hours of fun. Honestly though, I feel this one is missing something.... I think this needs a much more detailed story(or at least a story in general). It could use an auto fight mode, much like what the first one had. If a monster attacks one of my party members they should fight back. It would be cool to make the armor cosmetic much like how the weapons are. I'd spend much of the game grinding for better equipment only to see a number change..... I wish there were other types of party members. Like the paladin and ranger from the first one. But obviously more than just them. I think it'd be cool to add animal companions for each party member or maybe make it an unlockable skill for only a few. Definitely some different game modes. (Battle a dark version of your party, defeat all enemies within the allotted time, survive against an onslaught for an allotted time, etc etc) The party members shouldn't all be available right at the beginning. It seemed very lackluster.... maybe you could start with your first 2 like normal and then over time you have to save the other party members from enemy's who have captured them and copied some of their traits/abilities. I love this game, its great. But right now it's just a grinding game I use to pass the time. I love this series and see it so close to it's full potential everytime.

the first, and mostly the same weapons/armor/trinkets. The worst part of 
this game is the lack of the sense of progression. You feel as though

never a destination to get to. I finished the game and just thought, ""oh...
