Out of all the features of VRidge / RiftCat, this is by far the most reliable! I use an Asus Zenfone 3 Lazer as my left hand and a Galaxy S5 as my right hand. Yes the Asus is a little choppy, but I blame that on its lack of 5 ghz wifi. The S5 performs extremely well and works with absolutely zero hiccups. The only issue that had occurred for me is that I had to manually input my IP address to get it to connect, but that's the only issue so far. I'd like to request a few changes however, if I may: 1. A slightly better UI for the button layout... My Zenfone 3 Laser is a 5.5"" phone and I have a hard time reaching the edges of its display... I'd suggest that the buttons be moved closer to the hand the phone is assigned to, and also that they match the Vive's layout a little more. (Ex, menu on top?) It'd be cool if grip was on the same edge that you're holding the phone on too. 2. Better tracking... I understand it's hard as it is to create the system you have for hand tracking, but many games require you to be able to point at an object that you're holding to say return to their main menu (Blastworld), and some games just straight up don't work unless you can move your hands in full 3D space. It would be cool if you could at least extend your arms and have that be mapped out! But other than that, I really like this app and will be purchasing the full RiftCat soon!",4,13,1.0.5,2020-05-16 14:57:13,"1) Something we can look into, because we created HUD based on our phones and hands, which varies person to person.

I am a great fan of the Vridge/Riftcat client, but I am not enamoured of this particular app.The buttons are laid out curiously. No quit option, so i have to kill the app in a task manager. In the SteamVR world, the reset button just resets you to the same point all the time. I've been using it with a Galaxy S4, in working order, and it doesn't perform very well. I appreciate performance is subject to a given phone's accelerometer, but if something like my old S4 can't make decent use of it, I'm not sure what generation of phone we should be using with it. That said, didn't expect much. Worst tho, it simply doesn't work on Star Trek Bridge Crew, which runs well in Riftcat on my S9 and is why I bought the Controller app. But doesn't see it as a Vive/Rift controller at startup when it asks you to click a button on said controller and cannot proceed. Fix this and I'll give more stars.  Finally, the video tutorial for the Controller doesn't tell you anything about the Vridge config, which is ambiguous - if you have keyboard or controller switched on, it will create addition controllers in SteamVR for them too and things start to break.
