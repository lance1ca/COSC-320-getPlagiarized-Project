For starters, the music is wonderful. It was the first thing I noticed. And the game itself. It's simple but effective. Nothing more than a puzzle game, and it needn't be anything more. Its puzzles are logic based. It doesn't do explaining, it lets you learn for yourself, guiding you discretely but not to demean you, as if to assume you're a bit of a moron, like I've found that some games do. The levels make you think, but are not insanely difficult or nonsensical. I believe there were only one or two puzzle I solved, where I was unsure exactly what the pattern was to what I did was that resulted in my solving it. I never got stressed, I never felt mocked. It doesn't feel like a game that's trying to outsmart you, it feels like a game that wants to give you a moment to think, and a moment to relax. There were a few that I spent a considerable amount of time on, but I was determined to not look at hints, and to figure each puzzle out without growing desperate or taking an irrational approach, and that is what I did. I felt refreshed when I finished the game. I appreciate it very much, and recommend indeed.",5,10,1.29,2019-05-08 15:14:14,Thank you for the kind words :),2019-05-09 11:47:47

There are small touches like a non traditional intro screen and ship building animations at the finish screen that give the game personality. The background music suits the game nicely.

I don't play the genre often and there are very few puzzle games that I really enjoy. I would start by saying that the game strongly lacks any kind of explanation or tutorial/hints and tips for how you are actually supposed to play or interact with the game. This is apparent right from the main menu as the only two buttons are ""Settings"" and ""Quit"". Finding out how to actually begin the game is a puzzle in itself. I understand that's the point and it's quite novel, but when the rest of the menu is designed completely differently it just becomes a usability issue. The game overall is pretty straightforward and every level is essentially trial and error while you figure out how all the components interact. This, for me, is the largest issue with the game. The game's systems and mechanics do not progress in a logical way and the solutions do not evolve or relate to each other in any meaningful way. Your understanding of the game or ability to solve the puzzles does not progress at all because every puzzle is an isolated experience of arbitrary button pressing and switch flicking. Every other good puzzle game I have played slowly introduces mechanics, systems and designs to players while simultaneously combining them together as the game progresses to create a naturally evolving experience in which the player will learn and apply their knowledge to solve the ever more difficult challenges. I like the concept of the game. I think it could be made a lot better with the addition of hints/tips or some kind of tutorial, even just for explaining how you're supposed to interact with the game. I became stuck for quite some time just because I didn't know it was possible to tilt/pivot the control panel around. As I mentioned earlier, having mechanics that you can learn and apply throughout the entire game would also make it far more satisfying. For example, the number addition mechanic could be combined with the increasing pressure dial mechanic after they have initially been introduced for a more logical sense of progression and challenge. This way the player could learn how each one works in a previous level and apply that knowledge to solve a more complex combination of those mechanics later on. Some things I actually really liked about the game were the audio design and graphical fidelity of the 3D models and visual effects. They're both very satisfying and create a nicely presented experience that you do not often find on mobile devices. It's just a shame that the gameplay detracts from this.",2,11,1.15,2018-10-03 07:29:13,Thank you for the detailed review! There are really good remarks here I'm going to take into consideration.

I really enjoy the different methods the game presents to you when leveling up; no puzzle is the same as the last! There are all kinds of buttons to push, knobs to pull, light sequences to follow etc. and it really keeps your mind moving like a puzzle should, while gradually getting more difficult the more you progress. The music in the background with the constant sounds of gears turning and metal clinking also adds to the game's electronic and machinery atmosphere which is pretty neat. One minor critique I have is some of the time counters don't offer much wiggle room in terms of gaining stars. For example some puzzles I find a bit more difficult only give you 10 seconds to figure it out to gain 3 stars, which is a little too fast in some instances, since you need time to look at the puzzle first and see what you're working with before you start to solve. All in all I really like this game and I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzles, brain teasers or an overall challenge that makes you think! -Codeixx",5,0,1.15,2018-09-01 10:37:23,,
