First of all, Petr is VERY responsive. Unfortunately, I'm into my second day of trying to back up my files with no luck. I'm going to have to copy them over by hand, I have no other option. If you don't intend to back up your files, I think it's great and have used it for years, if you do intend to back your passwords up, I would use caution. I still have not been able to retrieve any of my data. I can see the data.crypt file Petr is talking about, he even looked at it and said it looks fine, but every time I try to restore my passwords, it say ""Download Failed."" I have two Google accounts and have tried both of those and once I logged into those I checked for the data,crypt files in both Google Drive and Drop Box and used the only one I found in all of those, still nothing. Although Petr has been very responsive, it hasn't helped me in the end. I'm very disappointed in the ability to retrieve my information and I would suggest if you're going to use aWallet you also back up your passwords somewhere else, which negates the whole purpose of the aWallet, to securely protect your passwords with the ability to restore them from the cloud if your phone is lost, as was mine.",2,25,8.5.1,2021-01-23 07:39:12,"Hello Dayton, If the data.crypt is not found in the cloud then either wrong cloud was chosen or aWallet Cloud doesn't have permission to read it.

Basically, this app, gave me the features I needed & usually worked as it should. However, a recurring ""glitch"" that I'm fed up with is the data not saving properly to the cloud backup. The app gives the msg that the data is saved & it's there when I check & then the restore is the old data. That does me no good when I need the pws to get into my most important accts immediately.

I was unable to find the directory to place my old data.crypt file from my HTC in using the free eWallet. I have a lot of accounts and so for many months struggled, due to the fact I had none of my passwords written down else where. When this popped up on opening the app for yet another night of trying to find a way to drop the file across, I had to purchase it. I made a new file using this apps setup dialog on dropbox with identical password to my old file. Then just dropped my old file onto my dropbox replacing the new file. Within seconds of resyncing I had passwords back for accounts I haven't been able to access for weeks. Thanks so much!!
