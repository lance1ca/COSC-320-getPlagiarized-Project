Overall I think it's a great app, really useful to zero a rifle or to keep traces of groups. I really like it, makes keeping traces of shooting sessions easy without having to keep the targets somewhere. The only thing I'd like is if it was possible to get the pictures already taken from inside the app. I got a lot of pictures in my cellphone and it'd be nice.
