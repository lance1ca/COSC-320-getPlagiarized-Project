I also like the layout of the screen with the inventory and powerups across the top. Unfortunately the melee animation for Questor is missing currently and the onscreen joystick controls are extremely imprecise meaning often pressing Left results in me going up to the right.

it's designed like the original, hold the fire button down, and move the control(this locks the play in place until you release it), that's how the original used to work.
