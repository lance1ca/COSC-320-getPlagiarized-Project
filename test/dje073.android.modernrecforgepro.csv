They also may like to consider improving auto pause restart capabilities in places of high background noise(e.g. car, street, shower, quiet). But please, if you do, don't let it impact on the runtime performance and be sure to keep testing on the cheaper less powerful or older phones.    Awesome app. Keep on improving it. You've got a good product there. Hard to find these days. Good work!  Also, the recording in a quiet environment doesn't work so well on my Xperia when the phone is charging from mains. Too much background noise. Works fine on battery.  When in skipping silence mode, on scheduled recording, it would be great if it datetime stamped each auto start and stop point with easy to read text. **     I can't read the tiny text on the top of the graphical display.  When using auto-convert on closing, of large files, the writing metadata appears to either be getting into a continuous loop or is just taking way too long to complete.  Still a great app though.

The app apparently saves recordings automatically to whichever folder you last browsed. So I made a folder within the app's directory for my class lectures. Recorded lectures for 2 weeks and was able to listen to them in the app, though had not yet had time to figure out how to save them to the cloud and back them up. Then a necessary phone update happened and everything got strange. The day before my final, all of a sudden none of my recordings were in the app. the folder I had made was completely gone. I searched my phone and originally it found the recordings burried elsewhere (of course with the finder not indicating where, though they were listed in the Samsung music player), so I go to listen to them and they won't play as mp4s (and the ones I had converted to mp3s and relabeled were gone from the start). So I downloaded vlc player to listen to them, crashed the program, reopened and when I went to look for them again via finder they were gone. After 2 hours of searching my phone and digging through it on my comp (the directory folder displayed it was last updated at 7:42 am that day, when I was driving to work and not in the app) and a call to AT&T tech support, no luck they were gone. My only guess is that the app's folder directory is technically a cache file that was slowly being cleared away in the background of my phone after the update. So in the end I lost my favorite study aid that had been working wonderfully previously the night before the test.   I'm switching to a recording app with an easier user interface and automatic uploads to the cloud.",1,1,1.2.1g,2017-04-25 07:44:38,,
