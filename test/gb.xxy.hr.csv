It's more complicated and frustrating than just using my phone for music, navigation, etc. in my car. I was able to get this running on a Lenovo Tab 2 A10 tablet, with Android Auto running on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. I had to use WIFI mode because the phone does not allow WIFI direct connections. To get the app running and usable requires opening Android Auto on the phone, going into developer mode and then turning on ""headunit server."" Then, I have to turn off WIFI on the phone and turn on my WIFI hotspot. Then, I launch Headunit Reloaded on the tablet, wait for it to catch the WIFI hotspot connection, then hit WIFI. All of this takes 5-10 minutes. Once the app is running it is mostly smooth...until I get a phone call. Incoming calls crash the Headunit Reloaded app, at which point my phone start vibrating from the call, but there is no option to answer it on the phone, because the phone still thinks it's running an Android Auto headunit. I also have found that if I do not go through all of the same steps to get started, but in reverse, when I leave the car, it causes Headunit Reloaded to crash, and leaves my phone in Android Auto indefinitely, until I force a restart.

First of all try and get a tablet with a separate USB port, I am using a LG gPad x this allows you to keep the tablet charging while You are connected to it. I do not recommend using the wireless connection option it takes a while to set up and a while to disconnect a USB cord is a lot more convenient plug it in your android auto is on pull it out and it's off. The wireless way is a hassle and before I was using the tablet with the USB port I found myself rarely using it on shorter trips. So basically get a tablet with a USB port set it up to auto launch the app upon plugin and you're golden. Also remember this is not going to be perfect, android auto itself is not perfect and this isn't as integrated as android auto so don't get upset if it doesent work perfectly for 7 bux it's a great deal and very good at what it is supposed to do. Also don't take me wrong the wireless option is a great feature if you don't have access to a USB port equipped tablet or if you want to just try it out before you set it all up in your car. Also one last thing to note  sorry it's not in order make sure the audio is routed to your phone than to car rather than phone to tablet to phone to car or phone to tablet to car the quality will be much better.

I'm not sure what you mean that the phone calls works externally. They are working from inside the app (the control part). Also for voice commands host mic is used, not the phone mic. Phone mic is only used if you disable the transport audio option. Please feel free to tap me an email with any question you encounter.",2017-01-23 02:42:40

One question, I have headunit launching automatically when I connect my phone USB cable and it works great, but when I disconnect it headunit then asks for access to a different USB device, I think its my USB DAC. At that prompt I have to hit cancel every time, if I allow access it tries to run headunit which of course can't do anything because there is no phone and it also disconnects my USB DAC which is a pain. Why does headunit bring up that prompt and how to I permanently make it ignore the DAC and only launch when a phone is connected?",5,3,Headunit Reloaded V2.4c,2017-01-18 02:43:53,"Hi Colin.
