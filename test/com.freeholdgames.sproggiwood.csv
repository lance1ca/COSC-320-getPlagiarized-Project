isn't without it's faults, though; classes are very unbalanced, with archer

low stamina, long distance movement skills, and strong AoE's), and others 
like Vampire relying almost wholly on luck (Vampire's untargetable teleport 
that costs stamina and HP, a very weak AoE, no ranged attacks, and their 
Thrall ability being almost completely useless). There's also a bug with 
the Alchemist's flask, where using one of the two charges will make any new 
potion you pick up only have one charge unless you empty your item slot 
completely before picking up a new one. It's also fairly short, and the 
town decorating thing is pointless. Overall a fun game, but could still use 
some polish, and some sort of endgame content after the story is completed.

Also the final boss on savage is just a huge cluster f with no tactics to speak with, you literally just spam abilities, like pumpkin spamming on farmer, yeti spamming on wizard or penetrating arrow spam on archer.

Sure, there are cool moves like enemies that charge in a straight line across the entire playfield. But before long, you have abilities like rolling straight past an enemy that's blocking you. Or freezing enemies in a 9-square area with your BASIC attack. If you've played a roguelike or two, you know those moves are WAY overpowered, enough to take half of the strategy out of the game.  Oh, they attempt to balance it out. They added enemies that summon three allies each, or enemies that can't be killed unless you kill two halves simultaneously, or enemies that can teleport you away from the exit. But by the later levels, this just gets chaotic. You'll have enemies that you just roll through or run away from because you have no hope of killing them.

The visuals are beautiful, and the gameplay is smooth (Galaxy S5 Cyanogenmod 11, Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 Cyanogenmod 12). Winning requires thoughtful, tactical use of your class abilities and items, as well as learning strategies for all of the individual enemy-types. I've played alot of roguelikes and alot of this game, in particular, and savage mode is *still* tough. Dungeon playthroughs are the perfect duration for mobile at ~10-15 minutes per dungeon -- this is basically my ideal commuting game.",5,6,1.2.9,2015-05-27 23:36:49,,

Love the fact that you also get to upgrade the town in between quests! However there are some things that make the game less fun. It appears to be that the poison jelly stacks and there is no way to see how much damage it would cause. For example if I kill 3 cute blue jellies in the same spot it would leave behind one blue tile, upon stepping on it I would take somewhere around 10 damage. Also I've spawned on the same spot as a next floor portal, so dungeon door placement could be better",4,2,1.2.9,2015-05-27 22:28:14,,
