I can tell the AI is helping me make shots. I can understand that because it's for use on phones of all sizes. I just missed the perfect physics of the PC version which allows the ball to meet the table and feels like a real game. Including the AI players who feel like they are making the same mistakes a real-world opponent would make on the Android version VA is clearly throwing the game by making a bad mistake to give you a chance to catch up and win.  After beating career play changing to quick play my game is stuck at the setting of one game rounds but all games are eleven rounds. And I cannot change the number of rounds when I do the game crashes. In spite of all these disappointments this is still best pool game available on any portable format,4,0,2.34,2017-01-20 05:23:41,,
