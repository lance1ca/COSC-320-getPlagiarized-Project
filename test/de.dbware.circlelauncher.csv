I'm a minimalist, wanted a screen with no icons whatsoever, here's how:  Set CircleLauncher's transparency to 100%, and set Label color to a highly-contrasting color from your background image.  I set my widget label to say, ""As you wish, my lord"", positioned right where my thumb would naturally go.  There were only two icons I couldn't remove; one was a flashlight widget, I solved that problem by downloading ASUS FlashLight app instead, which could then go into CircleLauncher like any other app.  The other was an ES File Explorer shortcut to my user folder.  For this, I created a new screen, set the shortcut's icon to 5 x 5, used a favorite photo as the icon, and used Carousel screen swipe effect.  Now, I have two screens with no icons, only the Android app button and the status bar.  Suggested (really cool) combination of settings in CircleLauncher:  Launcher style Circle, Show centered,  Opening animation Roll in from top, Speed 0.5, Closing animation Bounce, Speed 0.5, and in More settings, Fullscreen without the status bar.  The app has the ability to Backup configuration.  I hope the Restore will work - but setting everything up only took me about 10 minutes.",5,2,3.4.2,2016-01-19 17:09:24,,

The recent addition of swiping on any screen to activate one of six different different sets of apps, bookmarks, or contacts, make this a huge competitor to other such apps like Swapps.  While there's a lot of flexibility and tweaking one can do to make it just the way you want, layout is at least somewhat static in that you are stuck with a specific grid of icons (in the square config) and you can't control that grid layout much except to make all icons smaller/larger, shift the entire grid one way or another, etc.  You can't control how many rows or columns there are for example, let alone have empty ""slots"" within that grid.

It does mostly what I want but they could add better customization to it in various areas like sorting, long press, and other things I wont get in to. It runs solid and consistent and does not eat my battery much. I like the way it looks which is why I use it. However I also run Edge: quick actions and loads instantly. Another app called Pie Control is what I would rather use but it doesn't work on my HTC ONE. It loads instantly as well. It has a bit of a lag when opening and closing. It takes away from the cool smoothness that is important to me. I even paid 1$ to get the full version and it makes no difference. So the only reason I am using it now is because I haven't found something better that quite fits my needs. It is one app that I use but not totally happy with.

Circle Launcher has always been a very well put together application, and I've always found it to be a great utility and addition to the phones I've owned.  But I cannot give it five stars, I do not want to even give it 1 star, but with Android's rating system I have no other choice. My vehemence for it lies in the simple fact that I cannot kill it. I go into my ""Running Processes"" on my phone, and even though I'm currently not using the app, nor have I for quite a long time, well there it sits running, eating up precious resources.	This would be understandable if I was using it, but as I've said, I'm not. I select it in the menu for running applications, click ""Kill"", and absolutely nothing happens! I repeat this futile step exhaustively, and it does absolutely no good, the app just will not die! I have no patience for an app and it's developer, if they can't code an app correctly, and keep it from stealing valuable system resources, while it slows down my phone.
