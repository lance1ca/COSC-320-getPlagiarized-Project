Everything I've tried works beautifully. I cannot wait to dive even deeper in this.  I really love the 3D features. I'm in real estate both as a buyer and seller and this handy little app is very helpful in determining sunrises and sunsets in the layout of the property to be built. Great app I highly recommend it!  Thomas Roman,5,0,4.1,2014-08-11 11:53:27,,
