Just Bought this Today, Played for about 30mins, the Art Style is Done well, the Audio & Gameplay are FUN!! Challenging at Times. Other Reviewers have Complained about Poor, Unresponsive Controls etc .. SORRY! to BURST your Bubble, BUT, I Noticed NO Bad Controls here. MY, Positive Review .. Doesn't put a Damper on the other Reviewers & their Experiences, they have had. Because some People have Trouble Mastering the Controls, or Give Up, to Early., without Fully Immersing themselves into the Game, Others Pick up the Gameplay, VERY Quickly, WE are all Different., WE all Play at our Own Level. A Game, I Found was Easy, Others could find Difficult or Frustrating. FINAL: If You ENJOY, Indie Style Games, I would give this a TRY, there is always a ""Refund"" Option If, You don't like it in the end. Thanks to the Developer! Cheers!!",5,5,1.61,2021-01-08 03:50:19,,

I forgot why I did uninstall the game. The controls are so slow to respond. That's the main reason I would ask for a refund but I'm going to give it a second try. The game play is all there which I get the idea. Problem solving patterns married to nice backgrounds and sound effects.

The art design as well as the soundtrack are great and help to create a stunning atmosphere. However, it does not live up to Limbo, which is opendly promoted as a source of inspiration. The controls feel a little too stiff and the level of difficulty varies too much, which is why some deaths feel frustrating. Still, I would like to give 4 stars; however, the ""good ending"" archievement is bugged, and has not been fixed in 5 years.",3,27,1.61,2019-12-26 12:01:49,,

But I can that see a lot of effort has been put into this, so I kind of feel sorry saying these. And I think that in games like this, death should be evitable if you can be good enough.
