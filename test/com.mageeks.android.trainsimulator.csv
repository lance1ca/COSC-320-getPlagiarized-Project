The graphics are amazing! The landscapes, weather changes, train detail, and people detail is phenominal! I will say this for any one thinking of trying it, give the game time. Learn the gameplay and controls before you judge it. My first go around didn't go well and I was ready to quit on the game and and thought it was terrible. But once you get used to it, the game is very relaxing and enjoyable. That all being said if I could make any suggestions I'd ask for a few things that would result in a 5 star rating as opposed to the 4/5 that I'm giving it: The road crossings seem lazy. The cars just know to stop. There are no flashing lights, no bells, and no rail guards preventing them from crossing. For a game of this magnitutde I'd expect to see that fully functional. Then when pulling into a station... No train just pulls up quietly or honking the horn. There should be a bell option as well as the train whistle or horn. It would seem more realistic that way. My last point is not all that important but it would be a nice small change... There is no conductor operating the train. I realize in certain aspect views it is supposed to see as you Are the conductor, but I mainly like to view the train moreso than view from the engine. It would be nice to actually see someone in there, but maybe that is just me. All in all like I said, phenominal game! Great purchase! Easily the best train simulator 4/5!",4,21,,2018-10-22 14:56:58,,

I just have a few requests, for the Bombardier coaches and the mp36ph locomotive. Can you change the paint so they match? I know you cant add logos but if u could put them in caltrain paint that would be amazing!!! Also for the Bombardier coaches, since they are commuter type cars the last car on the train should have a cab. Basically when you get to the end of the line the driver leaves the locomotive and goes to the last car, better known as the cab-car. Add This as its unrealistic without. Maybe tapping on trains is easier for operation. Add small towns with stations in between major cities for this commuter service. Add a electronic bell to all trains. All cars should have couplers but the Bombardier coaches dont, add that please. Thanks! This is really needed as its unrealistic without these things.",4,56,1.3.7,2017-11-11 06:53:02,,

I have some problems and improvements for this game for what it has so far. I bought 2 P42 Genesis locomotives but I can only put both at the front but not one at the back. Why can't we choose the direction of the locomotives? For example back to back. The platforms are not so long. You can only fit 6 carriages. The graphics of the train are too dark when it's daytime sometimes. There is no shadow.  There is no red light at the back of the last carriage/ freight car on a train. When we reverse, it should become white and the locomotive red.   We have to slow down to 30mph to cross a level crossing or suspension bridge which is unnecessary. The penalty for going over the limit is a little too high. Maybe 200 instead of 500.   Let us turn the turntable ourselves for the best experience.  I hope in the future, there will be a passenger view. Also trains like Acela Express can be added. The stations are quite dark too. Please add some light. Where are the bells? I know I have said a lot but for a paid game, there should be high expectations. Many people don't want to buy games so it's best to convince them by doing the best.",5,42,1.3.5,2017-10-16 01:03:26,,
