Also, Rare Reedling sounds more like bagpipes rather than an accordion. Pummel seems to be more of a chromatic Monster, so the higher pitches should match that. It would also be helpful if there were either a setting that allows all or certain Monsters to have doubles due to long notes or place the long/short doubles next to each other. More octaves could also be implemented and there could be individual limits for which Monsters can have higher or lower notes.

Only problem is certain monsters like the mammot and quarrister need a range thats at least an octave lower. It makes it difficult when the assumed bass voices have higher pitches than the middle voices. Although it may be easier to use the rare monsters and give them more bass rather than having to change them.,4,8,1.2.0,2019-10-03 13:05:13,,

Finally, I'd like to be able to move Monsters around on the island and have multiples of a single monster.",4,21,1.2.0,2019-05-24 21:27:06,,

As mentioned before, this game is missing a lot of features. Namely on the musical side of things. It is impossible to do complex rhythmic sequences due in part to the simplistic approach to composing the music, triplets are impossible unless you want to give up on eighth notes and 16th notes. It could be very helpful to kinda emulate the app ""Maestro: Composer"", however that would mean a complete change to the game. Basically, this game was fun until a better composing app came out (considering the lack of composing apps that allow listening to what you write).

octaves in order for creating a bit more complicated music. 3. You can also 
add a more advanced mode of creating the melody. For example you can ask 
before creating a new music, does the person want to use easy mode or 
complicated one. 4. Make the piano have more buttons and octaves than it 
has right now. 5. If you want to make the game more popular, make it a bit 
cheaper right now, so people will want to buy it. Later on, you may 
increase the prices again (but not too much please). I think that for now 
this game is great, but there are still a lot of things to improve in order
