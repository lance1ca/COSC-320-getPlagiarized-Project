My issue is the fact that I would rather this game have been a slight more serious. The humor for me was just kid type humor. Sometimes it's funny but some times it's like a kid calling you a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. Funny because it's so stupid. Though I must say the humor does fit the graphics. I would really love to see this style of game with a more serious twist to it. Oh and if you don't like being made fun of as an RPGer you might wanna stay away. I, however, find these jokes the funniest in this game bc I am a serious RPGer and they got a lot of the stereotypes right :). All that being said I have to stress this game did waaaaay more right then wrong. Overall it has been a very entertaining and fun experience.

Each class offers something unique to mix up the fundamental tank/dps/healer game-play. Some items are unlocked permanently adding to the games replayability along with the additional classes as you progress. Your Characters gear wont feel shallow as it is designed to make diversity in play-styles. From these mechanics comes debatable options of how you will want to use synergy between your classes and their skills.

I am a PC Gamer (The master race). The reason I've hated every mobile game I've installed is I felt they were made for ""simpler"" people. They are usually short, lack depth, boring, and riddled with bugs. That being said, this game has none of those faults. This is the first mobile game I've played that I have literally drained my entire battery playing, from 100% to ""Crap, where is my charger!?.""   It reminds me a lot of  FF1-2/Chronotrigger. There isn't as much story of course, and there doesn't need to be. You are literally playing a game within a game. If you've ever played D&D or Pathfinder, then you'll thoroughly enjoy the banter from the GM and the players with comments like ""Where is my loaded dice?"" First game and first App I've ever given 5 stars to. Great job Dev team, my only suggestion to you guys would be in a later version maybe implement a multiplayer game option so I could play with my wife while we're waiting in line somewhere.   My only suggestion to players is back up your game somehow! I have a rooted T-Mobile S3 so I just use Titanium Backup, but I'm sure there is some kind of non-rooted option.",5,0,2.08,2013-12-20 18:43:04,,

Looks great on my Nexus 4 and Nexus 10.   Gameplay is old school turn based combat with wizards, knights, fantasy characters.   Music can get a little dull, but initially doesn't detract from the entertainment value.   I'm giving this game a 5 star rating because for the cost of the app, the value is really there for me. RPG's may be niche, but this game fills the void quiet well.   I have one minor complaint though. In order to obtain better equipment in this game, you must collect coins and take those coins to the blacksmith. The coins are earned little by little and the equipment is very expensive in comparison to what you earn. On top of this, the blacksmith only has a chance of 40% to successfully create your desired equipment. Many, many times this will fail, and the blacksmith will essentially steal your hard earned cash, while you're prompted to try again. Try again and don't have the coin? You're prompted to purchase an In-App bundle of coins.   I've leveled the blacksmith up and my success rate is now 55%, but it failed 10 times in a row, feels like thievery.

The biggest problem I have with this game is the business model that limits it. It has fallen victim to greed just like many other mobile games that are made to be grinding unless the user pays in game purchases. There is also no way to turn off the automatic game save. So if you die without money....you have to pay to get more gold in the game to resurrect your characters. Why won't developers learn that they can charge more money for a purchase of a game instead of limiting and crippling a game? Its okay, customers will pay more for a complete unrestricted game. I guess there are a lot of stupid people out there that don't see how much they actually pay in the long run and companies like this are built to milk the customer. The same stupid people who complain about a complete mobile game charged at $10 or $15.

I played it on my Nexus 7 Tablet and, in that first day, lost a number of hours to it. I am not generally a fan of touch-screen gaming, but this game uses the screen to its benefit by focusing on simple taps to interact with the UI as opposed to a silly virtual d-pad or other nonsense. This is important as it allows the user to intuitively interact with every part of the UI quickly, making the game one that is easy to jump into for short bursts when necessary. This is aided by the way quests are handled by the game, having you take the role of a dungeon master in charge of a party of table top RPG players. You can customize your real world accessories (your table, room, snacks, etc) then go into the fantasy world, which has lovely sprite work featuring homages to obvious inspirations (D&D) and even games like Journey. You take quests from various townsfolk who request that you kill monsters in dungeons, find items, escort people to far away lands, and more. All of this is done while leveling and customizing your party through their skills and gear.   This is a perfect example of touch-screen gaming.",5,0,1.45,2013-05-12 11:56:02,,

I have a 30 minute bus ride every day and playing games in landscape mode can be a bit of an issue.",5,0,1.45,2013-04-04 07:15:03,,

I can now give a proper review. This is probably the greatest rpg on android. It has a great retro feel but with fresh ideas. Being able to choose your own battles makes for some great tactical gameplay. The controls are intuitive and responsive (though I would like to be able to scroll the item shop menu a bit faster.. still, no big deal). The story is a cute parody of retro rpgs with mostly well translated humour and several amusing pop culture references (check out the dungeon masters!). All in all, I can't recommend this game enough. Only game I've given 5 stars to!  The only thing I can say to the Devs is great job and maybe consider a lite/demo version as I think giving people a taste of the game beforehand would be a good idea.",5,1,1.44,2013-04-04 00:47:56,,

I've finished it once and am playing again with the advanced classes (replay value, hooray!).  The game is fairly deep without being overwhelming. The interface is mostly well thought out; there are some minor pain points, e.g. traveling only one point at a time and being immediately sent to the area screen instead of staying on the map is consistently irritating, but it still handles vastly better than most mobile RPG's and is in most cases very intuitive.  Of course, it has to be intuitive; unless I missed something, there does not appear to be any kind of basic game mechanics tutorial, leaving you to figure just about everything out yourself. It has enough quirky differences to make for a few head-scratching ""what's this"" and ""how do I do that"" moments, but as part of the game experience that's OK.  I don't have a problem with charging for a game, especially when the price is so low and the quality is so high, but using IAP in addition to the up-front charge seems odd.

The skills are linear growing and from the beginning to the end of the game the only thing that changes is ""damage dealt"" and ""mana cost"". Everything is just so annoyingly linear and predictable that you wouldn't bother continuing this game to the end unless you already paid for it.  It is just plain retarded.

It's interface is simplistic, with pixelated graphics. It's writing is a bit dodgy, with some weird phrasing and other grammar issues. It's battles are barely animated and since you are both the dungeon master as well as the person controlling the characters that are role playing, you basically create your own story as you play it. But the writing can also be quite clever and funny, and there appears to be quite a bit of depth to the game. Not only are there lots of classes to choose from but you can also buy tons of other stuff, from more characters in your party to great weapons and even furniture for the room you are role playing in. It's definitely an interesting concept and it has me very intrigued. I'm glad I bought it and will continue to play to see if it can sustain my interest.",4,1,1.08,2012-11-02 12:37:47,,

Good game play, good setting, good interface.  Feedback: I uninstalled the game accidentally and lost about 15 hours of progress. Now I am going to wait til I get my new phone next month to start playing again. Wish it didn't delete the save unless I cleared app data. A way to transfer the save to a new phone\tablet would be great too but that is a big ask.  Could use a bit more tutorial going a bit deeper into the mechanics but I did figure them out quick enough.  Reducing blacksmith cost with items is lame. Just forces me to juggle inventory every time I craft.  HATE the kill 15 elites quests. Would be wonderful to change these to a combo of enemies, like kill 5 elites and 20 other monsters. The grind on these quests gets old.  Please add long distance travel, just add up the travel costs and roll multiple dice between each location. It a hassle to move great distances and I don't see the point. You could even interrupt travel and stop in whatever location you have a fight in.  -Thanks for the awesome game",4,0,1.08,2012-10-29 19:58:58,,

I love the way it simulates the good old days of sitting around the table with friends playing any of a number of popular fantasy pen and paper games back in the late 70s, and throughout the 80s. I was on vacation this past week, and spent almost all of Wednesday and Thursday playing the two campaigns. The first campaign is huge and extremely fun. Great story/plot, lots of side quests, locales, and of course monsters to slay and loot.      The second campaign is a bit shorter, but I liked the concept of being forced (slavery) into being a gladiator in an arena. Another cool aspect is that you unlock new and more powerful classes during a campaign. You can replace your current heroes with new ones sporting these new classes, or wait until you start a new campaign as you basically begin with new heroes as you would in the old pen and paper days when you began playing a new RPG system, or a new world/campaign.

This game is fantastic. The artwork is perfect for this style. The humor is awesomely nerdy and very similar to the conversations me and my friends have while playing D&D. This is a must by for fans of squad turn based combat games. The battles do become a little repetitive but the constant drive to make it 'just one more level' makes even this slight flaw manageable. My only request to the developers is more skills for the different classes (maybe 6 or 8) and a little bit of random chance in the combat (such as misses and more specials for enemies). As it is though, I have blown over 10 hours and I'm not even halfway through.   Buy this. Buy this now.
