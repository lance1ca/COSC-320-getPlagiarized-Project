Note that dying is very much part of the game. The RNG can be cruel, but rarely have I found it impossible to deal with. The refrences scattered in the game made me smile. It can be played without connecting to the internet. A big win combined with the pixel art style. (I will admit now that I am biased in favor of classic pixel art, having grown up with games such as Monkey Island and Kings Quest.) It is challanging, yet you can by pass the RNG if you pay attention. Made much easier as you play, lose, and learn the dungeons. (Online guides help also if you are so inclined.) Bottom line however is death is going to happen. Don't get attached. The replay value lies in pushing your limits and testing new combinations. Since the flow of the game is the same on all three levels of difficulty, you may not enjoy the game if you require the game itself to provide the variations. My only gripe of worth is the annoyance of the auto orientation.

Hoping for a better balancing system for magic resistance. Insane the only way to defeat some foes that are highly magic resistant after you physical fight dies is to throw away one of your tomes and start punching them back and forth for an hour only to have the next three rooms filled with nothing but magic users. Solution would simply be to cap magic resistance to still give at leave some damage.,4,2,1.330,2015-03-23 00:00:37,,
